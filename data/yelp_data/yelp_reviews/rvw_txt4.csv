"It's a small store front on Forest Avenue on Staten Island serving really delicious Thai food. A local resident introduced us to it. We ordered curry puffs, pineapple Thai rice, salmon curry with pumpkin (seasonal special), and their ""world famous soy chicken"" (vegetarian), and roasted duck with lychees. Everything was tasty and well done. It is a small operation and like everywhere else, they are short staffed. There was only one waitress taking care of everyone in the restaurant in addition to  the many takeout orders. So the food was slow in coming out. Be prepared to wait. If you are in a hurry, I suggest going elsewhere..I was a bit iffy about coming here due to the reviews but I was so glad to try this spot out. The prices for each dish is very reasonable and not as expensive as the other Thai locations in SI. At around 6pm on a Tuesday there was quite a few people wiating for their orders to takeout and dine in. Service is a bit slower due to the very limited amount of staff members that work here. The food and drinks are amazing and I can't believe I didn't come here sooner. I'll definitely come back whenever I'm craving for some Thai cuisine..I love this place we order from here at least 2 times a week. Would recommend many things from here. Forest Thai noodles, shrimp I. Blankets, as well as curry. Great place.Excellent food & service! Considering there was one lady servicing the dining as well as take out orders, she worked hard & did a great job. Will be letting friends & family know of this little gem! Best Thai food in SI!.My opinion, think this might be the only authentic Thai spot on staten island. I would recommend this spot to anyone..I almost didn't order from here because there were no reviews, but I'm so glad I took a chance. It's a decent Thai place on the island when there aren't a lot of options to pick from. Got the shrimp shumai, Thai spring rolls, beef pad see eew, chicken pad Thai, and Thai iced tea. The staff was super friendly at pickup. My 7 year old picky eater loved it. We will be back!.Forest on Thai is a place that stands out as one of the only true Thai restaurants on Staten Island. Their soups were made with more herbs than you'd get at most Asian takeouts. The same can be said for their noodle plates, which I found to have more herbs and more of an overall home-cooked touch to them than most of the noodles you get at takeout joints. What truly sets this place apart from most Thai takeout restaurants on Staten Island is the variety of their meat selection. As a pescaterian, I found many options on the menu, and they even make their seafood fried rice with real crab ! I ordered a Yellow Curry Scallops dish which was absolutely delicious. They make it with baby scallops, and for $11, the portion was fairly large. I highly recommend this restaurant, it's surely going to satisfy your appetite and the quality is great for the price..Forest Thai is NOT closed. They're on modified hours. Open at 3 or 4 PM. Support local businesses!.This food is absolutely amazing! The ambiance is nice, the prices are affordable, and the service is incredible!! The owners are so nice and accommodating. I love eating here.Their Thai food is delicious. I love the summer roll. Reasonably priced and the workers are very friendly."
"I was pleasantly surprised with a birthday dinner at Locanda Verde, and I was thrilled to be back there after so many years.  The dining room was completely packed and buzzing with patrons, even on a Sunday evening.  Our small table was positioned near the window, along the side of the restaurant, which gave us a view of the majority of the space, including the bar and open kitchen.I started with a glass of 2020 I Clivi Friulano ""San Pietro"" from Fruili, which was crisp and delightful.  When it came to the food, the gifters of that generous meal had selected the restaurant because of their special ""Celebration of Black Truffles from Umbria"" menu, though we wound up only ordering dessert off it, which I will get to later.  In the meantime, we decided to share a bunch of courses from their regular menu.We started with the Lamb Meatball Sliders, which were topped with caprino Italian cheese and pickled cucumbers.  The little burgers certainly were an odd mix of flavors that worked really well together.  They might have looked like traditional beef meatballs, but a bite revealed the gamey flavor of lamb, which was a bit of a mind tease.From there, we moved onto some pastas, where we opted for the Spaghetti and the Mezzi Rigatoni.  The spaghetti had a creamy, fishy sauce and contained peekytoe crab and bottarga di muggine (grey mullet roe).  Calabrian chiles added a subtle kick to the dish.  The rigatoni, on the other hand, possessed a more robust, earthy flavor with its lamb bolognese sauce, which was topped with a scoop of sheep's milk ricotta and a sprig of mint.For entrees, we selected the Roasted Duck, which was served with baby turnips and farro.  A pomegranate jus had been drizzled over the ingredients, making it a comforting and seasonal winter dish.  The Olive Oil Poached Halibut, on the other hand, was delicate and provided a slight relief from the heaviness of the rest of our meal.  The beautifully cooked fish was served in a broth infused with fennel, capers, and lemon.  While both of these main courses had some accouterments, we were still enticed to order a side of the Brussel Sprouts, which had been caramelized, along with pancetta, in an apple mostarda.  They were heavenly! Before the dessert arrived, I joined my companions in transitioning to a mocktail, one of which blended grapefruit and ginger beer and the other combined cucumber and lime, but both were extremely refreshing.  For dessert, the warm pear tart was elegantly composed from a poached pear surrounded by a flaky pastry crust.  It was served over an Italian cream and surrounded by pomegranate seeds and crushed almond amaretti.  Lastly, the Warm Dark Chocolate ""Lava"" Cake from the truffle menu did not disappoint.  The warm chocolate brownie was decadently topped with fresh hazelnuts, a scoop of black truffle gelato, and black truffle shavings; it was sinfully delicious!It was fantastic to see that Locanda Verde was still drawing a substantial crowd so many years after its opening, but it surely earned that distinction with its stellar food..It only took about a year and a half for me to make it back to Locanda Verde for another meal.  However, I recently started brunching in the city on Sunday afternoons and naturally thought to check their menu, which I was immediately drawn to.  Thankfully, I had made reservations two weeks in advance, because my arrival was greeted with a packed dining room.  Despite this fact, they had actually been holding a table for us, unlike many popular restaurants in Manhattan, and we were immediately seated.Our server was hilarious - super friendly and made us laugh with each of her visits to our table.  This was just an additional way to put a smile on our faces as we enjoyed a delightful meal in the buzzing atmosphere.  We started with cocktails, because, hey, it was Sunday, so why not!!  Their Bloody Mary included a skewer of Italian hot pepper, mortadella, and olive.  The actual tomato juice mix did not appear to have much black pepper or horseradish, but certainly packed a powerful kick of spice regardless.  However, I did discover a large amount of vodka when I reached the bottom of the glass...not that that is necessarily a bad thing...The Sloe Gin Fizz was an extremely light mix of the said alcohol with club soda and a dash of grapefruit juice.  Locanda has a reputation for delicious baked goods, so we were excited to receive complimentary foccacia squares topped with caramelized onions.  Now, onions are one of the only ingredients that I tend to avoid, but with its slightly sweet and charred flavors, this savory bread was too heavenly to pass up.  I insisted that we continue our carb party with an order of their famed Sheep's Milk Ricotta.  The large mound of fluffy, creamy cheese was topped with an aromatic truffle honey and a shaving of black truffle.  They could have plated this decadence with bland, standard bread, but they smartly realized that slices of crunchy burnt orange toast would only enhance the flavor of the mouthwatering, sweet honey.  When it came to our main courses, we had such a difficult time deciding, so we opted to go crazy and order 3 dishes.  We thought that we would be fine, as long as we declared that we would take home any leftovers.  If only we had known better!   First, fluffy sweet slices of thick bread were crusted with hazelnuts and topped with stewed sour cherries to form the perfect French Toast.  Then, a large grinder/sub roll was packed with a thick sausage that was sadly over-stuffed and over-worked, but topped with a flavorful Italian-style blend of crisp broccoli rabe, spicy peperonata, and rich ricotta.  Lastly, our perceived standout was the ""Scampi and Grits"".  A sweet, smooth organic polenta puree was topped with tomatoes, sausage, shrimp, and sunny-side-up eggs.  An herbaceous pesto sauce had been spooned on top of the shrimp as well.  Despite the lack of texture, I was in heaven with these ingredients simply melting in my mouth.   I also have to mention the bold cup of well-balanced coffee that I enjoyed before we rolled out of the restaurant with a destroyed table left bare in our wake and our bellies stuffed with breakfast treats.  Oh well; so much for leftovers!.I had been dying to try Locanda Verde since it first began making waves in the Manhattan restaurant scene, so luckily for me, I was able to easily secure a table thanks to a corporate lunch event.  In fact, I was rather shocked when we arrived at the restaurant and discovered that it was not overly crowded.  If anything, the atmosphere was very relaxed and casual.Our large group was quickly seated at a suitable round table and served slices of delicious, warm bread.  We devoured the doughy pastry prior to ordering the Sheep's Milk Ricotta with its hint of sea salt and herbs, but, luckily, it was accompanied by a second round of crusty, thickly-cut artisan bread.  The spreadable cheese was a creamy, decadent delight.  We also sampled appetizers like the Lamb Sliders, which were a little piece of heaven.  Each mini bun sandwiched a hefty, dense meatball that was slathered in a tangy sauce and was topped with a cucumber slice.  Each bite possessed an array of textures and complimentary flavors.  The Locanda Salad of bitter greens benefited from tart dried cherries, crunchy hazelnuts, and smoky speck.  The Radish & Cucumber Salad got in touch with its Mediterranean side via a salty, tuna-based vinaigrette.  Crisp Local Snap Peas redefined themselves with flavor infusions of pesto and radish.While all of these amazing tastes were served quickly and efficiently, the service slowed before the entree course.  This led to many an interrupted conversation, as we kept sending distracted, hunger-induced glances towards the open kitchen. My Roasted Sea Scallops finally arrived, though 1 out of the 3 was completely raw.  The remaining 2, however, were decently baked and, since we were already running late for our return to the office, I decided not to complain.  Thankfully the shellfish were complimented by crisp sugar snap peas, savory ceci grains, briny olives, and a rich pesto, all of which infused an earthiness to the dish.  The table also decided to share various sides, which were all fabulous.  Though I loved the Rustic Potatoes with garlic and Parmigiano-Reggiano; as well as the Organic Spinach with garlic, peperoncini and ricotta salata; my absolute favorite was the Wax Beans with almonds, mint, and preserved lemon.  What a seasonal preparation!We topped off our lengthy meal with a trio of desserts, though the most memorable of the bunch was the Pear and Ginger Crisp.  The fruit managed to maintain its crunchy integrity without any sogginess or heavy, syrupy quality.  The ginger added a warming effect and a spicy kick.  The crisp crust was sweet and decadent.  The accompanying cardamom gelato created a perfect pair with the zesty ginger.My first experience at Locanda Verde was discouragingly mixed.  However, I have since been to the chef's second spot, The Dutch, which has quickly become one of my favorites, so I think it is time for me to revisit his original venture and hope for an improved voyage..Came here to celebrate my friend's birthday and it was such a great experience. I dropped off a cake to surprise her with before our 5:45pm reservation and they usually have a fee of $6 per guest but they waived it for us. They provided a complimentary candle and brought it out as a surprise after our entrees. Appetizers: highly highly recommend the sheep's milk ricotta and steak tartare! Both were generous portions. The ricotta was a creamy almost greek yogurt like texture. The steak tartare had the perfect balance of truffle and was topped with a small sunny side egg and crispy bacon. Entrees: I ordered the bucatini which was a good portion as well. The guanciale, which is an Italian cured meat made from pork jowl or cheeks, provided the perfect meaty balance in the red sauce. My friend ordered the cacio e pepe which she enjoyed but I thought was a bit watery. Both our pastas were cooked to al dente perfection though!The service was great - our waitress was so friendly and the sommelier was knowledgeable and accommodating to our budget/preference. Would love to come back to try the ravioli and appetizers again!.we love Locanda Verde, it's definitely on our list of top brunch spots in the city. we live close by so we frequently come here for weekend brunch and it's consistently great.our favorites include the honey truffle ricotta on burnt orange toast, lemon ricotta pancakes (some of the tastiest pancakes in the city) and the soft scrambled egg crostini. also their coffee is excellent, sometimes coffee at a restaurant can be an afterthought, but i would go out of my way to order their lattes or cappuccinos. Locanda is a beautiful restaurant, has great service, and is relatively easy to make a reservation for. because of this, it has also become my go to place when i want to impress visiting family or friends..Came here expecting very good food based on the review. Everything was mediocre. The best thing I had was the burrata. Which I would come back for. I would recommend here. Nice place to try but I won't be back again..FAVORITE ORDERS: Sheep's Milk Ricotta & FocacciaFood: 3/5Service/Speed: 5/5Price (college student budget): $$$Ambiance: Bright open space; great spot for team lunches Would return & recommend? 3/5To be honest, was a little disappointed by the main courses here after all of the glowing reviews from locals & friends. I'll default the difference in caliber to the seasonal menu, but will not be motivated to return anytime soon. Out of the various menu items we tasted (listed later), the memorable dishes included the Focaccia Napoletana, Sheep's Milk Ricotta (ricotta was insanely good). The following orders were made to be easily forgotten: Autumn insalata, heriloom golden beets, Wood-fired garlic chicken (this was disappointingly dry), and Grandmother's Ravioli (sorry granny :/). One huge positive to note was how friendly and attentive the servers were! You guys did great. The food just didn't live up to expectations..We finally made our way to this essential rustic Italian restaurant in Tribeca. Housed inside the Robert Di Nero owned Greenwich Hotel. Although we waited 45 minutes for our table with a reservation, we still left very happy. The service was excellent, the decor was charming, and the food was incredible. We ordered the following:-SHEEP'S MILK RICOTTA-STEAK TARTARA PIEMONTESE: prime-aged wagyu beef, hazelnuts, black truffle. The truffle really came through and I loved it. Definitely an unique take on the classic tartare. -TONNARELLI CACIO E PEPE: may not be for people that are sensitive to salt. The pasta is simple but very tasty - reminded me of Italy. -MEZZE RIGATONI: lamb bolognese, sheep's milk ricotta, mint. The pasta was al dente and the sauce was mouthwatering. -DRY-AGED NY STRIP STEAK: served with polenta fritta & salsa verde. We were pretty full by the time steak was served but we still took a taste. The steak was cooked to perfection but needed to be paired with the polenta and salsa verde in the same bite to capture a burst of flavor.Oh, we also ordered cocktails just cannot recall the names right now. They were great though. We are really happy that we chose this restaurant for our celebratory dinner..I wanted to love eating here. We usually always stay in Tribeca and once upon a time in another life, I lived nearby. This place has long been on my list and finally tried it last time in town. It was truly a 2 star/""I've had better"" situation for us. It was a rainy NYC night and I thought my husband and I would brave the weather and make the quick walk over where we would tuck into a booth in this romantic spot, share some great Italian food, and enjoy the vibe. Well, we walked over, but my ideal ended there. It was insanely loud,which I didn't expect even if I should have. It felt like a cross between a millennial frat party and girls' night out central. It was not what we expected. We were crammed in a small loud table inches from other people. I could not hear to have a conversation with my husband. The service was so-so and I expect that in New York. But aside from the vibe not being what I expected it was the food that was a bummer, too. We stared with the ricotta appetizer. It was just okay, but I have had a lot better. We also made a bread splurge and did the focaccia because it looked awesome. It was also just okay and I didn't even want to finish a whole piece. I will say it is large so if you go and are hungry, start there. From there we moved on to a forgettable rigatoni that I also didn't even want much of. And we decided to bail out before dessert so we could hear each other and relax back at the hotel. Not awful. But not what I expected. Sad, but we won't go back..Went last night for dinner and the food was amazing. Rustic elevated Italian. The golden beet salad was perfection! Server was very attentive and the cocktails were great. It's my 3rd time here and I will continue to come every time I make it to NYC. Highly recommend!.This place has a unique vibe and chic interior. If you're not comfortable dining indoors, they do have quite a few tables outdoors. While our food was good, I was pretty disappointed with the slow service. It took forever for our food to come out and it was frustrating to see people who were seated after us get their food first.We got the sheep's milk ricotta, lemon ricotta pancakes and soft-scrambled farm egg crostino with a side of smoked bacon. For 3 people, it was plenty for us to share. The star was definitely the sheep's milk ricotta. It came with truffle honey which paired deliciously. I wish they would've given us more toast but the ricotta was terrific. I thought the other two dishes were decent. I liked the lemon curd on top of the pancakes. The crostino was an average dish to me. While the scrambled eggs were prepped well, I liked the salad the best.In all, it's a cool spot for brunch with plenty of options. I just wish the service was a little faster/reliable..I was pretty unimpressed by the food here, I had it a few times while staying in the city. The place is cute, loud, and quite happening. It was packed. The food however does not meet the expectation, it's really rather lazy. Simple things like serving food hot or crisping the skin on chicken are after thoughts here. And the food is oddly bland, lacking any kind of finesse. Things like sides taste like they have been sitting around for a while. It's a shame really. I would not recommend this place for groups, it's really loud and tough to have a conversation."
"I got treated to a lovely lunch here the day after Xmas.  We were the only party in the place.  it was leisurely and we enjoyed the decor.  the carved chairs that don't match, but coordinate a theme.  the leaded glass, the curved entrance.  I actually felt it was similarly warm and wooden yet open with windows like Dylan Prime.beet, string bean, gorgonzola appSalmon with pesto sauceboth were yummy and large enough to share.  seriously, it was a huge slab of salmon.  we declined dessert, but they brought some tiny delicious cookies.  not sure if that is the norm or a holiday perk.  they were YUM as I had clearly lied about being too full for dessert because I ate them up.  this could be nice for a date as I'm imaging it darker and more glowing. I'm a fan, but it wasn't hugely spectacular as we had all hoped.  Don't worry Mr DeNiro, we'll give it another go..Given the pedigree and the hype, I am giving a 2 star instead of a 3. OK - I've been anticipating our meal here for several weeks. We reserved a table for 4 at 7PM on a Saturday, and was pleased to hear over the phone that there was actually space available at 630, 730, and 8 too. Very surprising. So we arrived and found the space to be nearly empty. 15 or so folks at the bar, but only 2 other tables occupied. Shocking. But good for service as no one was busy.  We were seated immediately. It took a while to get our drinks, but the server was quite nice so I wasn't put off. Started with the artichoke salad appetizer. It was very plain, boring, and lacked the flavor one would normally expect. Strike one.Meals - Veal Chop (overcooked, not fantastic), Ravioli (overcooked) with a very mild sauce, Cheese pizza (undercooked, not very tasty), and Mushroom Risotto (quite boring - didn't have any depth to the flavor or seasoning). SO - strike 2.Desert - Tiramisu. This is my fave. I'm highly critical, so it might be really good, but I don't think so. The key problem was the 1/4 inch layer of cocoa powder sprinkled over the top. It made the whole dessert very dry and powdery, and a little bitter too. Strike 3.So as I mentioned earlier, the service was great.  I don't go to restaurants for the service though. I go for an overall abundance of great food. Ahhh-go did not provide us with that, and we are very disappointed. It's a real shame. I can't even promise to go back to give it a 2nd try, as the prices are high. I'd rather go to Al Di La..B/c it's new, it's crowded.  I think ppl are hoping it'll be Nobu good in service & atmosphere (or maybe I'm projecting)...but it's not.Ago is not inventive, it's not interesting, it's not unique.  Nor is it 11 Madison Park expensive but neither is it to 11 Mad's level of mind-numbingly-don't-try-this-at-home-unless-wanna-set-yourself-up-for-failure-creative.  So lemme break it down the way I saw it.Service: Spotty.  Too many hosti, not enough bus boys and our waiter who must've been new, was kind and helpful but also appeared, well, a little clueless.  Translation: you'll have to ask for water 3x's min and (at least our) server will be randomly confused -- all the while a sommelier will stop by 4x's and ask you how everything was -- while not taking everyone's drink order (only the wine)...and at the end of the meal, another tall dude in a suit will come by and exclaim, ""So how was everything?!""  puh-lease.  It's like a typical corp that you see with too many managers & not enough workers.Decor: If putting old wood chairs (which reminded me of the 70's) with tables & throwing a white table cloth is trendy -- well, at least it's no longer expensive to decorate hip.  Food:  Fine.  Eggplant parm appetizer, not the best, but alright ($12) they had a tuna tartare appetizer ($20) that my friend seemed to like ok (but was not of spigolo salmon tartare quality.)  I had the garganelli w/sausage...honestly, it was like they took prego & crumbled a little bit of sausage -- if you can't do better at home than this yourself...well, I don't know what to tell you.  The burratta looked good, (but they don't make that, or maybe they do) as well as the branzini...but if you f up grilled fish, you shouldn't have a restaurant.  The mushroom risotto was overcooked & clearly sat under a heat lamp (b/c it had the glossy skin sheath look to it)  but I don't own a restaurant & understand timing for a table of 6 can be a tough call.I would say go for drinks, the bar area looks like it could be fun but right now it's kinda painful with the big dudes w/slicked back hair & their wives who think that dressing like SJP in SATC is really the way to come to the city...but I'm being mean.  Esp if this is their night out & they're having date night.The bathrooms are really cool.  Bigger than most studio apts in the city.The best part?  The cute, nice door guy from the hotel who schleped in the rain to get us our cabs.  What a sweetheart.  (I know, I know, that's his job, but he did it oh-so-well.).The superficial things were spectacular. It seemed really promising. The subtle, classy entrance, the skinny dark haired hostess,  sexy, tasteful decor, the waiter and his elitist foreign accent, the extensive wine selections, classy wide rim wine glasses, the lighting.... I loved it. But the food was mediocre.  Our recommended mozzarella cheese appetizer flirted between subtly and blandness; My date's pasta was salty; My pasta sauce was sour. We ordered vastly different things (his was meaty and hearty, mine was lobster and supposed to be lighter) but our respective sauces were the exact same color. Kind of made our table look really boring. Oh, and if you sit anywhere on the same half of the restaurant as the exposed kitchen, be prepared for your palate to be contaminated by the smells of all the other dishes being prepared. We jettisoned without trying dessert because  the hearty meats or fishy scents coming from the kitchen didn't pair too well with gelato. They do however have the women's restroom the size of my living room. Please take advantage..Went here on a MONDAY night.  Highlighting that so its clear that Mon is a great day to be there...service is excellent. Professional waiter dug up a black napkin for me which pleased me much.  Food was good--we all had salads, I choose the raw artichoke while everyone else went with the pear / blue cheese combo.  I had fish, many folks had pasta but everyone love their meal.So.  The food was great....but.  The one problem with this place is the ecoustics. Its really loud in there, even when its not packed.  And its hard to hear people at the table which is frustrating. We sat in the back room in the corner and I wonder if that made it better or worse.  All in all--good food, good service and feels very spacious in there...Decided on a whim to check out with a girlfriend on a Thursday night with no reservation - was very crowded with a typical afterwork, downtown NYC crowd.  Found the hosts pleasant and welcoming, even though we didnt have reservations.  We went to the bar for drinks, made a few bar friends, and wound up sitting down and eating at the bar.  The food was amazing and the wine recommended by the bartender was outstanding.  I would rate this branch of Ago as highly as the one in LA or Miami - will definitely go back.  The only drawback is it is a somewhat ""dressed up"" atmosphere so if you are in the mood for a casual/summer type vibe I would try here another night..We were really excited to get reservations given all the hype around the new one by Robert Deniro and Agostino Sciandri however it just wasn't worth all the hype. It was good, but just average good. Not great good like you'd expect out of the duo that is behind it. The wines were pricey, the pasta average, and the experience so-so. I did like our server, a pleasant man that threw in the occasional Italian charm, however he wasn't as attentive as I'd expect out of this caliber of place. We sat in the quieter backroom with the wine cork ceiling. Nice room but I'm not sure what they were going for. With the big rock fireplace it seemed more canyon rustic than Italian. Also,  while the tables were well spread out which was a nice change of pace for a Manhattan restaurant, the restaurant wasn't very full (9p on a Friday eve?) and actually seemed a bit empty given all the extra space. Overall, it was an average experience with above average prices..This was some of the best food I've ever had.  The burrata was out of this world, as was the pasta with wild boar ragu.  It's definitely a bit of a scene, but well worth it.  I can't wait to go back..The restaurant is lovely. Nice, airy space. The art work by Robert Deniro's father on the walls and the menu is very fine. Our meal was good if not spectacular. I had gnocchi with lamb sauce and my wife had seafood risotto.  Both were fine. My side of asparagus was of fine quality but boring--just some average asparagus that had been boiled or steamed. No great shakes. The deserts we had were the best part of the meal, but nothing fantastico.  Service was fine. The noise was bearable--we got there early. The wines and the drink my wife ordered were excellent.   But for this money you expect a bit more 'wow' in all areas."
"Lenny's makes a pretty good bagel. Not the best that I've had, but definitely good. There was a line this morning but it moved quickly. Ordered:Whole wheat everything bagel with cream cheese- good, the bagel wasn't so fluffy but was good. An average size, I'd say. Tuna salad- pretty standard, just tuna and mayo. No celery or other veggies in it. Good if you're in the mood for tuna. Chocolate rugelach and raspberry rugelach- both flavors of rugelach had raisins and sunflower seeds in them. The chocolate had some small chocolate chips while the raspberry had some jam. These were not nearly as good as Zabars. If you want rugelach, I'd suggest you go there. Overall, Lenny's is a good place to get a bagel. Not my favorite but just fine..Best thing to discover in New York for me is that I don't need to go all the way up to Absolute Bagels, or more bonkers, go all the way to Ess-A-Bagel. Fast and friendly service, great bagels, good deals too (a baker's dozen is 14 here). Their everything bagels are not quite as heavily seasoned as some places but that suits me fine, half the stuff ends up in the bag anyhow - but the bagels themselves have a perfect crisp crust and a nice chewy inside, just as they should.I'm still a die-hard Montreal bagel fan, but Lenny's will win me over I'm sure..Lenny's Bagels is really popular. It's nothing fancy as far as atmosphere. It's all about speedy service and fresh bagels and cream cheese. There's NO seating. I find the people hanging on this corner a hindrance to the business. I definitely wouldn't want to sit outside here if they had outdoor seating. There's breakfast specials. Prices are typical for a bagel shop. I had the Pumpernickel Bagel with Garlic and Herb Cream Cheese. I went for coffee elsewhere and sat down the street to eat. I would say give them a try if you love bagels like I do. The bagel and cream cheese were both very good. I'm not returning any time soon. They don't cover the bagel in cream cheese and their employees don't care that you DID ASK for more cream cheese. He could have charged xtra but instead ignored me. It's not a welcoming environment. A block or two away is another Bagel Shop with a much better atmosphere and friendly service. I wanted to like Lenny's but it's not happening..Super quick, classic NYC bagel shop. Great spot to grab a bagel and dine at riverfront park (as I did). Service: 5/5Egg and sausage plain bagel: 4/5.Smoked salmon bagel was really good and they didn't skim on the meat. It is expensive though. I paid 12 dollars..Bagels here are tasty, but I think it really depends on who's serving you. The last bagel I got barely had any cream cheese, so disappointing..A good place for a quick lunch option. The bagel was tasty, chewy on the inside and did not need to be toasted. The garlic cream cheese was also tasty. Not the best in the area but overall decent experience. Prices are also lower than what you'd get in the area..Simple delicious and affordable.Lenny's is my go to bagel shop on the UWS. The bagel flavors are on point, and they have that perfect chewy texture. The toppings are standard fare but they always package the ingredients well and it's really affordable to boot ! ($5 for an egg ham cheese bagel) Some reviews mentioned owners not being nice but honestly they have been polite every time I go. It also feels good to support small Asian business. Highly recommended if you're craving a bagel in the area!.This place doesn't get annyyyyyy better! So many options to choose from! They are not stingy with the cream cheese, which is my favorite part. 100% recommend.The bagels themselves are a bit small and either over cooked or kind of stale I'm not sure which. The lox are good and the workers are nice."
"Sparks is such a convenient deli especially if your on the road for hours or going tobget on the roads for hours . This deli is absolutely great the food is a bit pricey but its worth for if you need to get something quick. I've never personally had a issue with anybody their.Everybody is respectful the food is delicious and they have such a variety of drinks and snacks they have ice coffee everything you need for the road. Sparks has it I am going to say tho that some of sandwiches dont have a different pricing if it's on a roll or a hero.My go to meal during my lunch break is ether a ham and cheese or a BLT the ham and cheese is an example of how pricing doesn't change ether on a roll or hero it comes out the same price so obviously get the hero for more food.The food platters are more expensive but you get rice beans and and your choice of protein obviously you have a bunch of different choices.They also sell masks small hand sanitizers' pretty much anything you need and if you had a long day of work buy yourself a beer to go..If you work around the area you would know not to buy from them no set prices and people still go there smh beacon eggs and cheese on a bagel with a small coffee came up to $10.75 and the next day the price changed again no f-ing way please and I repeat please no what your doing there ripping people off. Go at your own risk can't say you weren't warned....If you're looking for a deli in the middle of no where you'll land here. Surprising enough they have a lot of food and drink selections here. Their credit card minimum is only $5.00 which is actually decent. Their prices are a little high, but that's expected because they are in the middle of no where. They close early also around 5 or 6pm. I do like that there is a seating area inside as well as the outside. They lose a star because of cost. I would definitely go back because they keep the place clean..Great breakfast, very reasonably priced! They have a full buffet of hot food ready by 10:09am if you like to eat lunch early! Breakfast all day who can beat that!.Full of shit and their management stands behind them. They make up their own prices on a day to day basis. One minutes I get something it's this price the next day its' another price and they act like they don't understand when it was the same person who cashier's every day.The food is so mediocre that the only reason why they are still in business is because they are the only deli within the next mile and its a bunch of construction men and truck drivers. these men have no standards when it comes to quick food. DO NOT COME HERE AND WASTE YOUR MONEY. IT IS A JOKE.Food is inexpensive. Delivery can be so so but it's getting better. They have pretty much everything.  Even lunch specials that range from Italian , American and Spanish. One of the best delis in lic..Prices are on a rolling scale despite them being listed on the menu.They can't get your sandwich order right but they will fix it. Just got to go back. I use to love them, even more than NY Deli but they have fallen off in the past few months. The cold cuts are dry from sitting out in a fridge presliced and their chicken is half raw every time. Just wish they would go back to putting care into their food. Food tastes horrible!! Eat at your own risk!.Ordered delivery breakfast and it was delightful. They also made my coffee just how I like it..Well first off one thing I hate most is ordering food and having the highest expectations for it and its just terrible, that crushes me! Ugh but anyways I ordered the ""sponge bob"" lol which is crab cake sandwich with fries easy right? .. Terrible the crab cake was pretty much breading and the actual crab I found inside seemed more like imitation crab. It made me very sad then the fries oh the fries .. I asked for them well done and what I got was burned fries that were still raw inside how is that possible!! I dont know but the two stars they got were for the watermelon and because they had coconut water lol. This place really made me never want eat fries again but I will never be ordering from here . Thanks anyways..One of few options in the neighborhood, and they know it.  Decent eats.  Anything liquid is overpriced."
"Good pizza , really good crust with sesame seeds , fast service , most importantly they have espresso !.Caruso's on Smith Street treats me right. The pizzas are memorable for the sesame seed crust, an innovation that imbues each crunchy nibble with rich flavor and textures. The prices are good enough that I will often get a full pie and save a few slices for later. Another favorite: pepperoni rolls. These little doughy, meaty pastries are a chewy treat. At $2 each, you ought to get a few of them and impress your friends when you meet up at the park. I've had a few other things from the menu, and to be honest it's a little hit-or-miss. Today I got a philly cheesesteak hot hero, which was substantial, albeit basic. I did have a problem with the fact that my sandwich had been wrapped in foil and then sliced in half with a knife that shredded the foil, leaving the ends of the sandwich spangled with flecks of aluminum. Caruso's is an option I'm glad to have available. They regularly offer deals on GrubHub, so try and get a few dollars off your order. Pizza is very much their specialty, and is unlikely to disappoint.  That said, the menu covers a lot of ground, and there's no shame in rolling the dice. I wish you the best of luck..Standing there waiting for my order and a roach walks over the counter. I look over to where they prepare pizza and another one goes into hiding. Walked right out. Their food is honestly great, their pizzas, hero's and pastas. The staff is usually polite too. I was coming here at least once a week but it wasn't until today that I've decided to not come here anymore..An old school New York pizzeria down to the fat, stubby spice containers. They're plain and Sicilian slices are where it's at..Good standard take-out! Reasonable prices! Poor English skills of some employees,. Convenient! No frills!.First time ordering from Caruso's.   We ordered a pan pizza.  Delivery was within the time they said.  Pizza was good.  Had a nice sesame crust which gave it a nutty taste.  Sauce was not overly sauced which i was happy about.  Cheese was generous without being too much.  Will definately order again..I'm really torn on this place. The staff is usually really nice, and it's in a convenient spot with decent prices. The regular pie is passable, but the specialty ones and everything overall is just...not good. Tonight I got a grandma slice that was completely inedible because the dough was still raw inside..One of the oldest pizza spot in my neighborhood. I love this pizza because it taste completely different from other pizza. The sauce and sesame crust out due the cheese lol hard to believe but yes. Thanks for giving the neighborhood good food when the neighborhood was not safe to walk around. Now the neighborhood is unlivable due to the rent being to dam high..I've ordered from every pizza place in the hood in the last three years. Luzzos, brado, house of pizza and calzone, table 87- Caruso is the best.If ya like dough, get the medium. If ya like crisp get a large. The sauce is the boss and you should def try the meatballs..Caruso Pizzeria & Restaurant is truly quite special. Menu items are good and the staff is very friendly. We had Grandma Pizza that was certainly flavorful and delicious. Service is superb, no issues at all. I will come back again and try something new."
"Came here with my girlfriend late night for aquick cocktails. We were amazed by thecocktails this place has to offer. We felt like wewere guests in a cocktail lab where bartenderswere magicians. There was smoke, fire,flowers, herbs, fruits, you name it. Amazingexperience. Hands down the best cocktail bar in New York & you can't go wrong with their incredible view..Best drinks & service.The view its amazing & ambient A+ will definitely coming back soon.Everything about this lounge was great. The place was clean and smelled good. The staff and greeter was very nice. Our waitress was awesome, the staff also worked as a team in bringing and cleaning up our food. The food was fresh and awesome. We especially enjoyed the special bar drinks and beautiful rooftop view. Great atmosphere with really nice people. Will be back definitely. Highly recommended!.I've been here many times. I really like this place. Cozy and nice atmosphere. Great service. Unbelievable drinks. Delicious food. Wanna recommend for anyone.Dear Yelpers!What a comfy rooftop lounge! Came here for some drinks and the view but was surprised with a late night DJ and some of the most comfortable seating I've seen in a while. You all know I'm all for a ""loungy"" vibe because more often then not bars and lounges lack the comfort it takes to keep me there buying and spending more.We ended up enjoying the views and ordering more than we anticipated because we were comfortable in our nook.Make sure all of your party is present or they will not seat you unless you beg. The resurrection drink and the truffle fries were a hit. K and I ordered additional patron shots and our host and waitress were really accommodating.9 out 10, DEF recommend!.Ridiculous. Very, Very Disappointing.Scouting out the best speakeasies and bars in NYC, my friend and I have visited the majority of Midtown and Downtown establishments and were dying to try Ophelia after a reccomendatoin and seeing the pictures.Sadly, our experience was horrific--nothing like we've seen before. After having a great converstaion with the security guard in the elevator, we landed at Ophelia's entrance. Then, with her most condescending attitude, the host asked if we made a reservation and if our full party was ready.I told her that they were downstairs and waiting for the elevator, so she responded ""Who's they? The reservation is for three people!"" While we did make a reservation for 3, we planned on asking her if we could add another. Yet, before we could, we were stunned by her tone and facial expressions.What made the situation worse was that I initially thought she was trying to talk over the music, but as her tone grew louder and more arrogant, it sounded like she was literally yealling at us. And, again, never have I been so confused, so we just stood wondering what the problem was.After our two friends arrived, we were seated by the window facing LIC and saw that the seating was couch-style, meaning there was more than enough room for the four of us. And, speaking from the 50+ bars we'ver visited, we were definitely not cramped and were still easily almost 3 feet away from the nearest table.Following our seating, we ordered drinks (which were not bad, but defenitely not worth what we went through--6.8/10) and sat for about 3 three minutes until our check was brought over. For context, our server mentioned that table service would end soon, but the bar would still be open for drinks. I would typically not have complain as restaurants have to close down machines, but, in this case, the system would not stop anytime soon as the bar was still open.The saddest thing about our experience was our friends' reaction. We hyped up Ophelia up so much to them, but they were openly disappointed and asked me what the rush was for. With a beautiful skyline to take advantage of, I really hope management begins taking customers more seriously..High expectations and they did not deliver. I've heard good things from people and have always wanted to visit. We were able to make reservations on the day of without any issues. The customer service just was not there. There was a woman with dark hair that kept giving us attitude when she talked. She sounded very agitated, very annoyed with us the entire time and spoke unnecessarily loud. Our friends were waiting downstairs to come up the elevator and she came over multiple times in a hostile manner to ask for an update. Then she said we wouldn't all fit at the table. However, we got to the table and we could definitely fit 2 more people than we already had. ??? They asked us to put down a card right after giving us a drink. We hadn't even picked up our drinks at that point yet so we found it a bit strange. The drinks were fine. Like not great but not bad. Nothing really stood out to us. +1 for the view and ambiance. There's a small outdoor area with a nice view, and overall the interior was super pretty. The music was also good - they had someone DJ at the front. I'm glad I got the chance to try it but would likely not return..We had reservations for a Saturday evening, we got there and took the elevator upstairs (they ask for proof of vaccination when entering the building). Service was friendly and started off fine but then became really slow. We got a few drinks, and also the spinach artichoke dip as well as the charcuterie board. Food came quick but when we ordered our second round of drinks they took quite long. By the time they arrived we were already done with our food. We ended with the chocolate cake for dessert which was yummy but nothing out of this world. Overall our experience was good and the view was nice but not necessarily worth the pricey food and drinks..5 star even with a bizarre seating arrangement.... Soooo I was overworked and in dire need of drinks when a different site recommended this gem & I yelped it.  It said snow globe views and the Instagram boasted beautiful drinks so I invited 3 friends that ended up being just 2 in the end as it was like 10° outside that night. Set on the 26th floor of the Beekman we lucked up with parking across the street and stepped in. It was beautifully small and it did remind me of a snow globe. The first thing I noticed where the wall to wall red couches that outlined the walls with the Santa fur throw on it. And the smallest coffee table set for the food. I was like wait where are the tables. My friend and I were given a bench I wanted to say are you kidding me but I'm very open minded.The drinks from the site were sold out unavailable and off-season (lol) just my luck but I picked something strong and Smokey that was great actually and I also had a house cab not bad.I was hoping they had food and they did my friend had steak tartar which is  taste I have yet to acquire, a purple drink she hated, onion sliders and white wine. I had the steak which was perfect actually and chocolate lava cake that has ZERO lava in it. It was definitely not my scene but I picked it and enjoyed it maybe if we were by the bar next time it would be more fun bc I was scared to knock anything over everything was so super small. They had an outside where you could step out and smoke and look at the view right up my alley But it was freezing so I didn't go. I would not recommend a large party. Like just take a date. Definitely pricey but I have breech so it cool. They highlight was the steak, our waitress letting me record her had in my video and meeting the building owner in the elevator on the way  back down. PS they did have the bartender making the fancy drinks I wanted and being all animated which I love but I wasn't in that side of the globe so maybe sit by the bar if you want action and on the sides of the globe if you like intimacy. The view was spectacular..Beautiful classy elegant rooftop. Nice place to have a drink or apps. Will be back to enjoy further. They have a two hour limit per reservation. Well worth it and a beautiful place to have a conversation..FOOD/DRINK: awesome cocktails, very intricate and unique. We had the purple Toxedo, flapper, nashi sour, and Caribbean old fashioned- all amazing. Food was solid as well, truffle fries and asparagus dip. Very nice date night spotEXPERIENCE: what you're paying for. 360 views of east side New York on the 26th floor. Very pretty at night w views of either the city or river depending on where you sit. All tables are small side tables by a couch lined w blankets (?clean)SERVICE: fine, everyone was nice and wearing appropriate masksVALUE: a bit overpriced, you're def paying for the location. Drinks are $18 plus and all apps around similar and entrees $30. More of an app/drink place than full restaurant SUMMARY: great cocktail bar w yummy drinks and beautiful views. Would come back!"
"Been here twice in the last few weeks. The wings are good, they are smoked and interesting (not fried). We enjoy them although I wish they were a little warmer., it's not the standard wing sauce but it's got some spice to it.Got the Plaza special, which was wings, chicken tenders, onion rings and mozzarella sticks. It's a lot of food for about $15 or $16, and we enjoyed it (standard diner fried food).And the happy hour was certain drafts for $5 which was pretty good..Ran inside just to get away from the rain. Once we did a quick look over the menu we decided to stay and eat. When we ran in there weren't many people inside. Plenty of seating options but we wanted to stay kinda close to the door and window to do some people watching. Most people were eating alone but a few small groups of 2-3 people. Both restaurant and bathrooms were very clean. We put in our orders and the waiter disappears. Two come back nearly 25 minutes later with a partial order telling us - they are out of this or that. We order fillers for the missing items and remind our main waiter that we are still waiting on fries and home fries. Nearly 10 minutes later he's back with the hottest, fresh out the grease fries and home fries. I wanted to laugh at the home fries. This potato casserole thing could never pass as home fries in the south. So now we have hot food and near room temp food. Flipped the sliced steamy home fries over my Florentine (no spinach) omelette to find a happy middle. No lie, it was tasty but I'm nearly finished with my meal when waiter brings over hollandaise sauce and a plate of spinach? TFI laughed at my sister when she nearly got third degree burns from her fries she now does a belly laugh at my spinach and sauce. The food was tasty and they did have a decent amount of vegan options so not bad at all. Later found our our server was new, and he apologized over and over. I think this was his first shift or first shift during this weekday brunch-ish hours. Then when we went up to paid the friendly manager also talked with us. We weren't in a rush, the food was good, they had plenty of options even when dining with a sister that is vegetarian that doesn't eat seafood or eggs, the place was clean, and everyone all around was kind. They are good with me..Perfect poached eggs! Had to eat fat to make an appointment nearby and both the food and service was great..STILL GREAT! I have not been to this diner in while even prior to COVID but I was so pleased to have had another great dining experience here. I was first introduced to this diner in the early 2000s and they have consistently had great pancakes since then.In the many trips here, I don't think that I have ever ventured past the breakfast portion but I have not gotten any bad reviews from those who had. I usually order the pancakes but on my last trip, I switched it up a bit and got my favorite ""Red, White and Blue"" pancake platter with a waffle instead. The waffle was filled with blueberries, covered in strawberries and cooked perfectly to a crisp while maintaining its internal moisture. I requested that the whipped cream be put on the side and I surely didn't need it.The staff was efficient and attentive as usual. They still use handwritten bills too. They have added BBQ to their menu but I don't know if I am ready to venture to that part of their menu yet!.I love this diner. The food is always good and the staff is always efficient. Its great for a late bite then stroll on the promenade and great to take the family too (including the little ones). You can't go wrong with any of their pancake platters..Park Plaza is an adorable diner that is the epitome of your classic, old-school family restaurant. It's nothing fancy. From the ambiance to the menu, it's simple and homey. What is great about Park Plaza is the fact that they have such a large menu, with...get this...quite a few vegan options! This makes it a great place to bring the whole family since there is something for everyone.I ordered the Vegan Cheesesteak, which I thought was delicious but was a bit odd that it was served on a bun rather than a hoagie-like roll as cheesesteaks usually are, but no biggie. The ""steak"" definitely tasted like Impossible meat, which I enjoy, and I'm so happy they have vegan cheese here.My brother had a Greek Wrap with the ""deluxe"" uncharge which gave him fries and onion rings-which of course I snagged some of. His girlfriend had chicken tenders because she has a childish palate, haha. Both of them enjoyed their food-again, this is not fancy food, it is classic diner food so that's the expectation and standard.It was also brother's girlfriend's birthday, and after speaking with the host, I was able to convince them to bring her a slice of cake and a birthday song at the end of our meal. She and my brother were tickled with this gesture and enjoyed the cake (although I thought it was a bit dry).On our way out, we observed lots of elderly diners-this is definitely a place that seems like it is popular among older folks who long for simple food in an old-fashioned, family atmosphere that they long for. A few of these folks wished us a happy birthday on our way out, which I thought was sweet.If you're looking for a simple, family-friendly diner, Park Plaza Restaurant is a great spot. It has a sense of nostalgia that just warms my heart!.I walked inside and just took a seat. No staff checked that I was vaccinated. Bad sign (and illegal).The server who came up to me was wearing a mask. Good sign. Then I look around and notice all servers are wearing masks. Another good sign. As I eat my food, it tastes good.At the end, it's time for me to pay. The manager is standing behind the counter. I walk up to him, and notice he's NOT wearing a mask. Before I get too close, I ask him ""Can you please put your mask on?"" ""I don't have one"" he answers. SERIOUSLY? This should not even be legal. How could the manager not only wear no mask, but not even have one? Remember, we're talking about a restaurant that lets customers in WITHOUT ever checking for proof of vaccination. As long as people like this get away with this kind of stuff, COVID will last for the rest of our lifetimes..Had a late lunch here with 2 family members today .This place is a hidden gem ! The food is good and plentiful , the waiting staff professional and prompt .The manager is attentive and personable . The prices are reasonable for down town Brooklyn ( For myself , cousin , and his daughter with desserts the bill came out to $102 , so ...There is inside and outside dinning ( we ate outside ) . The inside is clean and spacious with windows that run the length of the resturant and bar on two sides . The decor inside is just below luxurious , clean a spacious . The bar area is roomy and cozy at the same time ( Enough room to chat without being overheard , but close enough where your not too far from your date .I highly recommend this place if you're visiting Brooklyn NY ( 3 blocks from the Brooklyn Bridge & 5 blocks from the Manhattan Bridge. ).What's old is new again!I used to work in the area and would pass by Park Plaza all the time. I always thought it was just a run-down diner and a relic of the past. But they completely renovated earlier this year, and that couldn't be further fro the truth!What they don't tell you is that they're also lowkey one of the best barbecue joints in this part of town! And with Hill Country Food Park closing, they might be your only option in DUMBO/Brooklyn Heights.The BBQ menu is for dine-in only. I suggest bringing some friends and ordering a full platter. The ribs were amazing. I'm not usually a fan of pulled pork, but theirs is phenomenal. Just the right amount of fatty juiciness.If you sit towards the back, you'll get more of a bar vibe than a diner, with lots of TVs and the actual bar. Great beer selection!.This restaurant has EVERYTHING to appease even the pickiest eaters! They have diner staples plus their own SMOKED BBQ & a FULL BAR! We were warmly welcomed by one of the owners, Dimitri, who you can tell is so loved and respected by his staff members.  It's like you become part of their family when you dine with them!  You can see that they adapted really well to the COVID and the changing times.   Dimitri and his staff built THREE decks to accommodate outdoor seating comfortably and social distancing distancing approved.  One of those decks will be turned into a beer garden where you can enjoy a couple of drinks.  My husband ordered the BBQ combo platter- they smoke their own meat.  I ordered a classic Brisket sandwich with disco fries.  Their brisket was probably THE best I've ever had - and I grew up in NYC.   Drinks were made to perfection and their Guinness was properly poured! I even had room for waffle & icecream.  I told my husband that this restaurant gets an A+ in my book for having cookies and cream as an icecream flavor.   Next time we go I'm definitely trying their burgers!If you're ever around the DUMBO area in brooklyn, stop by the PARK PLAZA RESTAURANT.   You won't be disappointed!.We have ordered the Family package of ribs, chicken and brisket a couple of times recently because it is amazing! It comes with a choice of sides. The portions are not that large, however, so we order extras. Cornbread is also included, and it's fabulous."
"First time in the United States of America. First time at Arby's.Good, cheap food - everything i ordered was exactly how I wanted it to be. As fastfood it was pretty decent. Great staff, that was helpful, Nice and seemed happy. Overall a good experience..I don't often walk through the Epicenter of the NYC Asian violence but to visit this Arby's I do.  Cleaner than most fast food joints in NYC.  Roast beef sandwich  is a solid option with crispy & crinkled fries! The real reason I will return is that the staff and manager were so helpful and friendly!  It revives my hope in humanity that everyone will one day call NYC a better place..This spot closed super early 7pm! It's a complete shit hole and the staff are super ghetto! Your not going to get what you ordered so be prepared! And don't dare go back to ask for it to be corrected you will get nothing and they don't give a shit! This place should just close it's disgusting.This place is extra ghetto and dirty. Employees eating Chinese food and refilling their own cups of soda while yelling loudly at other employers ""call my phone"". Only 2 people working .The other must be on her break- eating smelly outside food- or is that the stinky trash? At least they have sockets to charge your phone..If I'm gonna have a fast-food hamburger, soda, and fries, I rather go here at an affordable price. Arby's sandwiches are fresher..This location is conveniently located by port authority. It is on 8th ave between 39th and 40th. I've past by this place every morning and always wanted to try because I haven't had Arby's in like 15 years or so. Finally got a chance to try it today.Me and my friend came here because we had a coupon for a free signature sandwich with the purchase of any soft drink. Obviously we purchased a small drink and got a free burger. Came out to be 2$ or so. Make sure to sign up for their coupons online so you get this coupon in the mail.When I got back to the office, the burger was kind of smaller than I expected. The picture on the menu looked pretty decently sized but in reality it was quite small. After eating this and a large curly fries, I was still hungry. Burger tasted alright, nothing spectacular, just wish the portion was larger. Good thing I had this coupon so I didn't spend too much at this place. Probably will only be back if I get some more coupons of free stuff sent to my email..Although the worker who helped me at the register was extremely nice and cool, the food here is just plain awful. I ordered 2 Buffalo chicken sliders, a large fry (which I didn't finish) as well as their Steak and Bacon sandwich thing. They all just sat in my stomach like a rock and I immediately felt nauseous. I wouldn't recommend Arby's at all. I came here because where I live we didn't have one just yet but now I can understand why everyone online doesn't seem to like Arby's that much..I'd love to give it 5 stars, but I'm worried that my last great experience was a fluke. Previously, they have been unprofessional and tables dirty, but my latest visit was a truly good experience! Staff was friendly and smiling. They actually spoke directly to me and made eye contact. They let me know if my order would take a few more minutes. The place looked clean and most importantly, the food was super-delicious! Definitely get the traditional Greek gyros. I highly recommend.One con that I will mention now is that their credit card reader doesn't take a chip, which is much more secure than a swipe, so beware or use cash..3.5 starsWas looking for a spot to eat at around my rotation site and since I've never tried this chain before I decided to give it a try. Not bad! I think they specialize in bbq sandwiches and the Smokehouse brisket sandwich that I got was pretty good! Bread was soft, onion rings were crispy, gouda cheese added all the right flavors, and condiments blended in very well. The brisket itself was a little dry though but had a very nice smokey taste to it. I also got the curly fries and thought they were ok. 3.5 stars but I will round up because the service was super fast and friendly!.My BFF and I saw a commercial for Arby's showing some delicious looking bacon steak sandwich called the Bourbon. We have not done Arby's in ages since it was like underwater in every aspect you can think of. But recently a new Arby's open next to the Port Authority Bus Terminal and maybe I can get some take out on the way home to try them out.I got the Bourbon Bacon Steak Sandwich, which has Angus steak, bourbon sauce, brown sugar Bacon, cheddar and crispy onions on roll that supposed to be toasted but was not. An Angus Philly, which comes with roasted onions and peppers, Swiss cheese and mayo. A Crispy Chicken Salad, that includes bacon and Crispy Chicken instead of soft. I also got crispy fried Onion Rings and Potato Cake, 'think triangle shape hash browns'.Well this is what I think about the new Arby's and there food;Bourbon Bacon Steak Sandwich, --- didn't do anything for us, needs more flavor or some au jus sauce to dip it in.Angus Philly, --- was good due to the roasted peppers, needs more cheese.Crispy Chicken Salad, --- the bacon and crispy chicken is different and not bad for fast food joint.Potato Cake,----  not hash brown enough, MehOnion Rings,---  nice and crispy.I would do the Philly cheese steak and onion rings but the rest is a no no, it's still fast food made in mass and cutting the corners cuts the flavor and quality"
"Xochil Pizzeria is simply fantastic. Can't talk highly enough about Xochil Pizzeria. Incredibly yummy and also healthy. The crew was really helpful and service is exceptional. Xochil Pizzeria... What a great find..I had never had a tlacoyo before but had read great things about the tlacoyos at Xochil Pizzeria.   A tlacoyo is a football shaped mound of masa stuffed with a filling.  I ordered a tlacoyo con carne which was stuffed with a finely-ground meat, possibly chicken, and chopped white onions.  It was then topped with green salsa (you can order red), cotija cheese, crema and a generous mound of pork.  Delicioso!.Pizza is okay, not all that. This one guy is rude and makes me not want to go back. Didn't even fully listen to my order so I didn't get one of my items..Formerly Rax Pizza.  I am a pizza critic and i must say this pizza is not bad. Plain pizza that is. The rest doesn't look too good but the plain slice is tasty..Pizza is decent and the service and price is good. There are seats you can grab and enjoy your pizza. Very casual pizza joint and worth considering if you are close by and don't want to walk far for pizza."
"Pizza's pretty solid here, got the thin crunchy crust with a really good ratio of sauce and cheese, this is my go to place for a quick slice.The primo greasy slice. They're very friendly and open late-- I think I've been in around 2 or 3. Sometimes they throw in some garlic knots for free."
"Visiting from out of town and my friends brought me to their favorite local watering hole. It didn't disappoint and we finished the night here. A good mix of people, with space in the front and back and some bar seating along the middle. The drinks were strong and the beer was smooth. The hotdog was a nice touch and hit the spot too. They had table service, and our waiter was a character who added to the wonderful night. Highly recommend and if I'm back visiting I'll be back too..I started my ""moving on from my ex"" project by accepting a date here.  I didn't have high hopes for this date since it was literally my first time back out in the market since a very brutal breakup where I was still talking to that ex (it was also the friendliest breakup ever, like something out of a Woody Allen movie).  Before walking in, I was listening to M People's ""Moving on Up"" and when I walked in, I saw they were playing the movie ""Waiting to Exhale"" on the projector near the back.  Those were good omens for me as I had just bought ""Waiting to Exhale"" and was looking forward to seeing it on my own.This is definitely more the place for you if you're a drinker vs. a non-drinker like myself.  I had some sips of a drink, which tasted fine but the date itself was probably not great since I was just trying to get ready to date again but we all have to start somewhere.  It was a nice find and I'd never been before.  It wasn't the least bit crowded..2nd stop on a night out exploring the area. The old fashion was good, executed as it should be. Venue is quite small but was cool that played home alone 2 on the wall through the projector. My bill was incorrect and had to take some time for it to be corrected which made the experience a little frustrating..If you are looking for a place to start or end your night , then definitely pop into this place . If you are looking for ambiance , and great food, you won't be pleased . The only food available is a hot dog , folks mentioned cheese puffs and nuts, never saw those or offered. The best part of this place is the wait staff , nothing else was a hit for me ..Love love love the home vibes here. The staff was awesome....I believe it was Adam on Sunday evening and he was so much fun! This is the kind of bar you want to hang out at because it's comfy, good vibes and good company! Can't wait to come back!.This was the classiest looking ""dive bar"" I've ever seen. The decor was minimal with slight industrial and earthy touches, this gave the space a welcoming feel.The drinks were pleasing. There's a beer & shot combo for $9 which I believe is a nice starting point.  The only complaint I have is that they no longer serve the speciality hot dogs, & happy hour is no more.If you're in the neighborhood then Mess Hall is a solid bar to enjoy some libations..Loud bar (because of the music, not the customers) with lots of spirits and a ton of personality. They have a $5 beer happy hour 4-8p every day. The outside patio is a plus, but get there early if you want a seat..Rats everywhere outside and around their patio. Music is also bad and terrible food selection..This is such a cool spot in Harlem! I love it here! I must come back. It's a narrow space in the beginning of the bar but when you go further down there's a bit more room and tables. They have a cool list of drinks and really eccentric hotdogs. When I got there about 10:30 PM, they had no more hotdogs unfortunately so I have to come back to try that. It's a good first date spot however, the music can border obnoxiously loud. As long as you're next to somebody, you should be able to hear them fine. They also have a huge screen projector for watching games and picnic table-like tables to sit at in front of the screen..There's really not much that I did not like about Mess Hall. It is a very low key bar that has a nice rotation of draft beers and small bites. Mess Hall is a great place to meet up with a couple of friends for a chill night. We visited on an early Sunday evening, and Mess Hall was somewhat empty. Plus, the bar has happy hour every day until 8 pm, which is very inviting. The service was a bit disappointing (I think the servers were in between a shift change). That said, one of the servers comped a couple of our hotdogs."
"Really good foodGreat tacos (mango jerk chicken is a fave)I love their salads- always fresh and fillingAnd plantains and other sides are tasty.Cantina for brunch is a must! I came yesterday with the expectation of getting a few frozen drinks but was surprised when I arrived and was informed about their brunch menu. I ordered the eggs with rice and beans. Everything was tasty, well proportioned and delicious! I also ordered a pitcher of sangria for the table. Not too strong but just enough to give you a good buzz. Overall I highly recommend this place for brunch.The best place for frozen drinks ever. I've been out of the country yet nothing compares to this place! The food is amazing I highly recommend any taco they all are delicious. Great staff also I've been going a lot during Covid for pickup and delivery.So many things wrong with my order I don't know where to begin. I ordered Brussel sprouts and asked to hold the chorizo (vegetarian), they didn't. I got 3 tacos (1 jerk-mango, 1 fish, 1 steak). The jerk mango was disappointing. I assumed it would be fresh mango orMango salsa topped on. It was jerk season chicken with a mango sauce that was probably bottle or canned. NOT GOOD. The flavor of the fish was good, I just wish they actually put fish in there instead of a small piece with tons of batter. The cherry on top was the chicken quesadilla that looked like beef at first sight. Biting into it taste like leftover chicken. The flavor to the ""chicken"" taste like they initially intended it for another dish. Made the quesadilla not taste like an actual authentic quesadilla. 2 stars go for efficient driver and courtesy..We ordered Ubereats delivery from here for dinner and decided to try a bunch of items. We ended up choosing a platter of 8 tacos that came with 2 grilled chili-lime chicken, 2 modelo battered fish, 2 Mexican pulled pork, and 2 crab & shrimp, as well as a Tijuana steak bowl. We were incredibly impressed with the packaging of our food - all the tacos were neatly wrapped in foil and came with ample sauces & guac, while the steak bowl (which came with an extremely generous helping of fresh avocado - my fave!) had all of its ingredients (Spanish rice, bell peppers, onions, black beans, corn, & lettuce) piled neatly, so shout out to both the restaurant staff and delivery worker who put together and delivered our dinner  While the tacos are definitely on the pricier side, they tasted extremely fresh and there were generous portions of protein in each taco. The corn tortillas were light and carefully grilled, the fish was very flakey - which we really enjoyed, and the chicken was well-seasoned and grilled as well without becoming too dry. I really appreciated the crunchy purple cabbage stuffed into the tacos which gave them lots of texture and the restaurant's attention to detail in including even lime wedges to serve with our takeout. I'm sure there are cheaper options in the area, but we were very satisfied with this meal..Cool Spot.Black Owned.Harlem.Sexy Inside & Outside.Good Menu Items.Not To Pricey.Tasty Food.I Will Patronize Again..Looking for some awesome frozen drinks in Harlem !? This is the spot. I love the blue patron frozen margarita (one is enough) I mix it with coconut margarita, so good. The food is kinda bland to me , gauc & drinks is a hit though. Sheltered Outdoor & indoor seating, friendly service..Cantina never disappoints. I can't always count on them for affordable drinks and good food. One drink always has me hammered. But they are so good that I have to have at least 2. Today I went for the frozen rum punch and it didn't disappoint. IT TASTES LIKE JUICE, BE CAREFUL.   Always a good experience here..This is one of my favorite places in Harlem! I've been here 3 times and the food and service are always on point! I always come here for a margaritaThis is the first time in a long time I feel like I'm getting what I pay for. In other restaurants it's nothing for me to down 2-3 margaritas, but here ... after 1 margarita I'm tapping out! You truly get what you pay for.The place is clean. The wait staff is nice and the food is So yummy and flavorful.Check them out!.Food is decent, but they charge a mandatory 18% gratuity. Tipping should be discretionary. What if they service is crappy? Should the server still get the 18% gratuity?On top of this, sales tax is computed on the gratuity. Sales tax should not be charged unless it is called a ""service charge"". I'm a CPA. I know.The music is too loud, and not to my liking. On top of this, the manager is a dismissive a**hole..I want to give them 3.5 stars. The drinks were great, which is why I'm assuming people come here. Now, i like to think of myself of a taco connoisseur Lmaoo.. i truly live for anything that says taqueria! This place wasn't bad, i just felt like it didn't have the authentic taqueria feel that i would normally seek in a Mexican spot. For one, the drinks were definitely on point. I had a rum punch on the rocks, and my sister had a frozen rum punch. It was delicious and strong. More than one would definitely have you feeling nice. Secondly, the food. I was taken aback by the food. A little underwhelmed to be honest. I didn't feel any kind of Mexican flavoring to the dishes. My sister ordered mango fried wings, which were good, i ordered chicken nachos, and she ordered a two chicken tacos (at 10 for the pair) the tacos (see pics below) she enjoyed. They came dressed with pico. She enjoyed them. My nachos came with rice, beans, cheese sauce, chicken and guacamole. Normally I've never had nachos with rice so i was taken aback, and the chicken was tasty, but it didn't have a Mexican flavor to it. It kinda just tasted like grilled chicken on top of chips and beans with cheese sauce. Now again, I'm a little critical cuz i love everything taqueria. This wasn't bad, but I've had better. I was expecting authentic taqueria. But, it really wasn't bad for what it was. I'm just a tad bit spoiled when it comes to tacos and Mexican food. So I'll rate 3.5 stars. They have an outdoor area that's covered, and the tables inside were spaced out. The music was really loud, we were greeted immediately. The sitting time is 60 mins per party per table, and the food came out pretty fast. Idk if i would come back here. I feel like $5 per taco is a bit pricey and you can't just order one. For drinks and wings, sure. Not so much for the tacos and nachos. Anyway... see pics below.Went on a Tuesday night with a friend for some drinks . We walked up to the place . The wait time wasn't too long . They have an outside eating area that's inside if that makes sense lol . The Tables were spaced out as much as possible . The stay did wear mask and was attentive . I had the mango jerk wings and frozen rum punch . The drink was so good I drank 2 of them and took one to go lol . They have a happy hour but we missed it. The food wings came with 6 pieces . I wouldn't really order that again . My friend had the mango jerk taco and said it was pretty good . Service was decent especially since there was only one waitress working the whole outside dining area . I would definitely want to come back for a quick happy hour but if you're looking for a date night or something more intimate this wouldn't really be the vibe ."
"I have dined at many omakase establishments. This establishment in particular, with the Soho Omakase at its current price ($125) is completely worth it and you should go now. The fish (and the level of preparation that goes into some pieces) that Chef Victor serves is way beyond what other establishments are serving. The pieces are unique and so are the prep styles.My favorite piece, as Chef Victor described it, is ""Wagyu of the Sea"", Rosy seabass/Blackthroat Sea Perch. It was the softest piece of fish I have ever had and I cry tears of joy just thinking about eating that again. I was pleasantly surprised that dessert was of their own creation (and not the typical half mochi). They dream up their own ice cream flavors and bring those ideas to life. Our server was beyond nice and warm. He was extremely welcoming and took so much time to explain the different drinks to us. He even let us sample some before deciding on our orders. There are a lot of polarizing reviews for Chef Victor. Some sushi chefs are pleasantly quiet while they work, only announcing the details of each sushi piece. Some are conversational, chatting occasionally with the diner. Some are very passionate about the craft (and the chef falls in this one). Just find the one that works for you, and stick with that. Regardless of your sushi chef preference, the fish quality here is undeniable. I would definitely come back!What I ate:THE SOHO OMAKASE, $125Seasonal Appetizer[13] Selected Classic and Seasonal NigiriChef's Choice HandrollTamagoGourmet Miso SoupSeasonal Dessert (sesame and ginger ice cream).Wanted to like this place but chef victor has made it very hard not to leave a bad review.As we got close to the end of the dinner, I asked the chef if he can reduce the quantity of rice in the Shari since we were getting quite full. He was very pissed by the request and questioned ""then why you ordered so much food?"". Ive been to many of the top omakase in the city, and I remember both chef from Yoshino and nakaji asked all the lady guests if they wanted smaller rice towards the end of the meal. Most of the time I can finish the regular rice portion but it was nice to be asked. Victor's attitude was just Wowwwww.Oh and please never mention if you like uni or toro to the chef. He will dismiss you for having a ""cheap palate"". Here at kintsugi, if you don't compliment on the extremely poorly prepared kohada (where he wrapped it with salt and put it in the fridge for a week and call it ""dry-age""), you will be deemed as someone who doesn't understand sushi culture.I later found out through a friend that the owner of Kintsugi is on a tight budget for purchasing fish, so don't expect to find top grade tuna or uni here. I do understand that since for a $175 omakase I don't expect it's fish selection to be comparable to those $400 omakase places. However, please don't blame your customers and recount them for having ""cheap palate"" for liking high quality tuna and uni that you can't afford to serve. That's just straight up hilarious. If you are looking for high quality omakase in NYC with a moderate price, I strongly recommend Sushi Ikumi ($185pp) and Nakaji (surprising $265pp)..If you are looking for reasonably priced, not Americanized omakase, here is a place to go.I opted for 10 piece grand street set.Pieces I really like:Kohada: strong flavor, ""fishy"" in a good way.Monk fish liver: mixed with white miso, better than foie gras Smoked uni: the smoky flavor makes the sweetness of the uni more concentratedUnagi: warm, fatty, not overly saucy Ume shiso roll: simple yet delicious, love the refreshing combination of plum and shiso, the seaweed is so crispyWill come next time when I crave for tasty sushi and will recommend my friends and family who are also sushi lovers.Good sushi and amazing service! Flavors were a bit experimental but still quite good.Came late on a weeknight for an indoor meal with a friend. We originally booked for outdoor seating but the waiter offered us an indoor spot and it was just too cold to be eating outside so we accepted. Each of us opted for the rush hour (9 nigiri + 1 handroll for $65) and were more than satisified. Each of the pieces were so fresh and the rice was amazing (do not overlook the rice!). There were some interesting flavors like BBQ sauce used which I've never had with sushi before, but it was a good experience overall. I'm more of a classic nigiri type of person but it was fun to try a few new flavor combinations.At the end, the waiter offered us some sake based on the pieces that we liked, and we were offered ""cherry bouquet"" sake, which was the best sake I've ever had - so light and sweet! I was very very impressed by the selection and his knowledge. He was also very attentive throughout, constantly filling our classes and answering any questions we had..Good sushi but not quite 5 stars because of the ambiance. The sushi counter seats seemed far too close to each other that I felt I was bumping elbows all night with the party next to us, which was uncomfortable and awkward. The chef also did not interact with us at all the entire night - just slipped sushi on our plate underneath a large plexy glass. I did really appreciate that the waiter let us sample some sakes before ordering and also loved the plates and cups, which had cool gold markings on them. But I do think the restaurant could make some effort to vamp up the place and that the chef could be more friendly to help make the overall experience better, which imo, matters once you start paying 3 digits per head..Chef Victor at Kintsugi works tirelessly to serve a broad menu that features aged, smoked, pickled, and rare nigiri. The Soho Omakase was well priced at $125 and was a good way to explore the restaurant's offerings and original recipes.The polarizing and opposite reviews on Yelp of Kintsugi made me initially hesitant to visit the restaurant but recommendations from 2 friends who spoke highly of Victor and the quality of his food pushed me to make a reservation. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed getting to know the chef and learning more about his sourcing, technique, style, and aspirations over the course of the evening.I was particularly impressed with the smoked uni, pressed sanma roll, and hojicha ice cream served for dessert. Chef Victor's attention to detail and acute awareness of customer preferences and sensibilities improve the guest experience at the restaurant. The host was also well versed in sakes and made excellent recommendations. I especially enjoyed the Tenryo Koshu aged junmai daigingo that he recommended.As for the rice, I agree that it wasn't my favorite but I would have difficulty explaining why. I noticed that since the chef worked predominantly by himself, he was unable to tend to / replenish the rice as frequently as he might be able to if he had an assistant. Though, the time that Victor spends on slicing in real-time and preparing the courses is time well spent. The nigiri were consistent in temperature and flavor.I noticed comments that diners' experiences can differ based on where they're seated and how they get along with the chef. As I was seated in front of the chef and engaged with him beforehand and throughout the meal, my experience was lively, informative, relaxing, and fun. But I can see how the service might be inconsistent. I recommend the 5pm seating and the $125 menu.Victor-san is a rising star who is working incredibly diligently to improve and impress. I hope in the next few years that he and his restaurant gain more popularity - I would love to see Chef Victor shine as a chef separate from the restaurant too. Follow him on Instagram (@victorsanfk) and watch his stories to see his creations!I think Kintsugi and Ushiwakamaru are comparable on nigiri quality and price. While Ikumi remains my favorite in the mid-range, Kintsugi is a great option..TLDR: Excellent omakase experience and yes, it's worth it if that's your question. Kintsugi has some super unique offerings with a multiple omakase options which makes it more accessible. They specialize in hikarimono or silver-skinned fish i.e. mackerel, saba, aji, etc. so just keep that in mind. I believe they can make some adjustments as needed though.To be frank, we almost didn't come to Kintsugi based on a lot of the reviews. However, the pictures looked good and the only way to really know is to go yourself. Man, probably one of the better omakase meals we've had.We opted for the $125 tasting (SoHo) for an appetizer, 13 pieces of nigiri, a hand roll, soup and dessert. We'll probably try the $175 (Kintsugi) one on our next visit which has another 2 pieces of nigiri, more premium choices and an additional sashimi plate.The seasonal appetizer was a house-smoked spanish mackerel with a vinegar miso sauce. So good, wonderfully smoky and a great hint of what's to come.In regards to the comments about the rice, I don't know what the issue was. It had the right balance of sourness, sweetness and perfectly al dente. Each bite had a wonderful mouth feel.Here are a few pieces that really stood out to me though.Smoked spanish mackerel, already described above.Sanma or pacific saury, pike mackerel, etc. This was the first piece but just full of flavor. Think saba but dialed back a bit, a nice balance of fattiness.Mackerel or saba. Chef prepared this on a unique rice (I think it was mixed with sea urchin or uni) and gave a light sear before wrapping it with roasted seaweed. Probably the most unique mackerel piece I've ever had.Smoked uni. Haven't encountered this anywhere else. It's a blend of four different types and a unique umami of creaminess and smokiness.I opted for quite a few a la carte pieces here. There was a smoked skipjack tuna (bonito) or katsuo. Chef gave me a nice fat slice and it was probably one of the best bites of the evening. If you're into silver-skinned fish, this is probably one of the best places you can frequent. I got a special temaki handroll with chopped Japanese herring or Nishin.If you appreciate quality sushi, come here hungry and enjoy your omakase as it's meant to be enjoyed. Let the chef choose and you'll be glad you did. Will definitely be back again. Kintsugi is a sleeper sushi-ya which should be on your list..Big omakase fan here. Now that we are in 2022. Omakase prices have reached an insane 400 plus at most places... It was a pleasant surprise when I stumbled upon Kintsugi. The attention to detail to every single course rivals all the big name sushiyas in Manhattan. Highly recommend the beverage pairing to go with the incredible meal..This was my first ever omakase experience and one of my favorite and special meals that I've ever had in NYC! I came with friends and our party of four made a reservation for an indoor omakase dinner at 9:30. We ended up being the only diners inside so it felt so intimate and private. We got to watch the chef prepare each piece in front of us. We ordered the Soho Omakase that comes with a seasonal appetizer, 13 nigiri, hand roll, tamago, miso soup, and dessert. All of the fish tasted fresh and flavorful, carefully prepared with a light brush of sauce and wasabi wrapped within each piece. The chef really took his time making each one for us. My favorites of the night were the uni, toro, shrimp, eel, and tamago!!! I had never had uni before and the texture and taste of the uni here really blew me away. Slightly smokey and decadent. Really good. The raw shrimp really surprised me as it was my first time having uncooked shrimp but the way it was prepared made it taste incredible. I also don't know how the tamago / egg ended up being mindblowing; I've had many eggs, tamagos, omelettes in my life so I thought the taste of this would be predictable but it really took me by surprise.. I loved it so much. Only complaint I would have is that the rice here was a bit salty so sometimes it didn't taste the best paired with fish. The slightly sweet and acidic vinegar sushi rice flavor is what I'm used to and would have preferred. My friends also noticed this. Our meal ended with a black sesame ice cream in a rice cracker macaron and cookie crumbles, which tasted light and creamy, super fun to eat. I honestly really enjoyed this meal, maybe because it was my first ever omakase experience and I was with friends in what felt like a private restaurant. It was my first time ever having a meal like this so it felt very special and I remember leaving the restaurant feeling so giddy. I came here a few months ago and recent reviews seem to be unpleasant so I'm not sure how things are now. Since this meal holds a special place in my heart my rating reflects my experience but it's also worth noting that there are plenty of other omakase restaurants in NYC worth checking out if you're unsure about this one :-).Had an amazing time with friends here. The experience was intimate, extremely educational and the service was attentive. We had The Kintsugi Omakase featuring 15 Selected Classic and Seasonal Nigiri with a sake pairing and I'll be dreaming of it until I experience it again - Highly recommend it for a date night."

Since this meal holds a special place in my heart my rating reflects my experience but it's also worth noting that there are plenty of other omakase restaurants in NYC worth checking out if you're unsure about this one :-).Had an amazing time with friends here. The experience was intimate, extremely educational and the service was attentive. We had The Kintsugi Omakase featuring 15 Selected Classic and Seasonal Nigiri with a sake pairing and I'll be dreaming of it until I experience it again - Highly recommend it for a date night."
"We got married at this venue about a year ago and although I've been busy I had to write a review because this place was definitely amazing!One of the first things a loved was their quick response. They called me back considerably fast compared to most other places where I had called previously. Their rates were amazingly flexible depending on my preferences an requests. I had the cell phone number of the person on charge of my party and he responded to me almost immediately every time I called him. He also happened to be the owner which made everything so much easy because he didn't have to double check everything with someone else plus he always had an answer for me.This place was very accommodating. They don't charge more for a Saturday than a Friday or things like that. The cake is included in the price and they have beautiful choices plus it was delicious. Their food was amazingly delicious and very very generous (my guest told me that they thought the canape and cocktail our was the actual dinner because of the incredible amount and variety of food served. Everyone at my party said that the staff was overly friendly while super professional and that service was great! If you have a minimum amount of people you can have a separate room for the canape party for the same price. We also added an hour to our party for a very reasonable price and we weren't rushed out of the place even after the extra our was gone. We had two bars set up at the reception room plus waiters constantly serving drinks. Not once did any of my 180 guests had to wait for drinks ( and this party was full of heavy drinkers). They served some premium liquor for no additional cost and the most cute mini coronas.After having the room set up for 190 people we still had plenty of room at the dance floor (which stayed packed all night).It ended up raining after the church so we didn't go to the botanical gardens as originally planned but we still managed to get great shots outside the venue. The green trees, the little bridge and the gazebo (which I never thought I was going to use) en d up saving the day.Sure, the place needs to be updated. It needs paint on the outside and the bridal/waiting room downstairs is claustrophobic...is a small room in a baseman but it didn't matter at all. We didn't use the bridal room because is was too small and sad but besides that it all worked out beautifully and we would recommend it to anyone looking for a great party, with great food and reasonable prices at a very flexible and easy going venue. I had issues with our photographer that didn't show up and sent a person that had no idea of how to take photos as a replacement but The Crystal Room managed to make the issues insignificant...our photos were terrible but our wedding dinner and the party were outstanding!Thank you so much!.Love this place. If I ever get married again I am having it here. That, or my 100 birthday party whichever comes first. In fact I'm gonna start making new friends so I can have a party here.  Everything was good, the room was beautiful, food was excellent, nice bartender and staff. Very attentive lady and gentleman, very accommodating and polite. Restrooms was immaculate. Huge parking lot and location is near Father Capodanno  Boulevard. Who knew this was even here? Location is convenient too..I had my wedding there april 17th,2021. Everything was awesome. The food was delicious. The place is beautiful.My guests kept telling me how good the food was. They followed the CDC guidelines with temperature checks, mask wearing and cleanliness also had hand sanitizer stations. The staff was excellent and very nice. They attended to my now husband and I needs. I had my wedding ceremony outside and it was beautiful. I couldn't of asked for a better day . They made my wedding day beautiful.Looking for a hall for a party.  Look no further then the crystal room. Louis and his father Charlie run a wonderful catering hall.  I held my wedding at the crystal room and by far they went above and beyond.  The prices are very reasonable and the food is to die for.  My guests are still raving on how good the food was.  Our coordinator for the night was Guy and he was wonderful from the minute we got there to the minute we left. Anything you needed he was there. Thank you again for making mine and my wife's wedding day memorable..Had my daughters sweet 16 here, all went well, food excellent, staff friendly and accommodating, I also attended a Wedding here a year ago and that was also very good, highly recommend!.Had a surprise birthday party for my wife on the 21st, the food was excellent, the service was great. This was our third party at the crystal room, will definitely book another party there in the future..My husband and I had our wedding in August and all I can say was that they were outstanding. They catered to your every need and made sure everything was perfect. Our family and friends came from all over and were wowed. The food was phenomenal and the owners were the best. I highly recommend this place to anyone. We will be definitely having another function. At The Cryatal room!!.The Crystal Room was perfect for our big party last weekend.  We had the smaller of the two banquet rooms which was a perfect fit for our 90+ guests, DJ and photo booth.  Great thing about our banquet room was that the bar was also in it.  They worked with us every step of the way and went above and beyond on the day of our party to help us set up and coordinate everything.  The staff was super friendly.  Oh yeah and the food was delicious!  Thank you for making it a great night to remember..We just celebrated my daughters Sweet 16 at The Crystal Room. Food was great, staff was great, we were taken care of by Donna and she was very accommodating to every person in the room. Managment is a whole different story!! I dealt with Louis, who wasn't very personable at all. I also paid for several things for the DJ to do and was told THE DAY BEFORE that we weren't allowed to do them. From pyrotechnics to a CO2 blast on the dance floor, all of which are NOT a hazard or harmful to anyone or anything. Not only did I lose money that I spent with the DJ for these things, but also last minute had to disappoint my daughter and completely re do her entire plan for the night starting with her entrance. They were not accommodating in the least bit to even try and compensate for my loss. They were rude and also told my DJ he would be arrested if he proceeded with what he had planned. We were NEVER NOT ONCE told of any restrictions whatsoever until the day before the party.  I would absolutely never recommend this place to anyone with even just the simple fact of who runs it and how poorly they treat their customers..We recently had our sons Christening at The Crystal Room and it was absolutely beautiful. The food is delicious and the staff was delightful. From the moment we called just to inquire about the price all the way to the last minute when the party ended Louis and Charlie were very helpful. Louis was amazing at accommodating us and having everything go as we wished! Highly recommended and we will definitely have future parties here."
"First time at this location with a colleague. Food was good but service was slow. Not really an hour lunch location unless you order in advance. I had the grilled salmon salad and it was delicious! Will definitely go back after work or order lunch delivery early..Went there for a casual dinner on a Thursday night. My wife ordered the American Burger and fries. Woke up in the middle of the night with terrible food poisoning. I'm sure the burger was the issue because she hasn't had anything to eat since 7am in the morning. Definitely would not be going back..The menu is okay but the waitress (Spanish woman) has the rudest attitude I have ever experienced in a customer service setting. Her does ut right in front of her boss and they don't do a thing. I ordered chicken and got pasta but it was too late. I already left..My fiancé and a couple friends were on the train going to Manhattan and hopped off hungry, and this place was right by the station. The waitress let us know when we came in that they were short staffed and that we might have a bit of a wait for our food. She was extremely friendly and personable, and really, our food didn't take super long. I had the pasta with vodka sauce and I added shrimp. Very tasty and and filling! I would definitely go back if I were in the area to try more of their menu..I got pasta and a side of mashed potatoes. I needed to try this place out as it was fairly close to my apartment. I was kind of shocked by the price of the food but nonetheless, was in the mood for some pasta. Surprisingly enough, I was happy to find out that the pasta portion was actually fairly large and the sauce complemented the chicken well. I will say that I think the sauce was a little too much and could have used less. The mashed potatoes were the thing that I really didn't like. I loved mashed potatoes but these were not seasoned or anything and basically had no flavor. I think the mashed potatoes that you'd make from home from the flakes in the box would probably be better..Absolutely love this place! Stopped by for happy hour on Friday night and enjoyed myself so much that I came back for dinner later that night and so glad I did!! Great service, great food and a happy hour that can't be beat in this area! I will definitely be back!.Really enjoyed my visit There's our door seating and all staff are wearing masks !I live in LIC my whole life and never tried this place , I wish I did sooner For starters we ordered the fried calamari And it was the best calamari I had No over fried pieces and nothing too chewy I got the Italian burger with broccoli rabe roasted peppers and mozzarella cheese it comes with fries or sweet potato fries  . It caught my eye because the broccoli rabe and I love broccoli rabe! I tasted all the ingredients on the burger and deff would order it againMy boyfriend got pasta don't remover it's name but had chicken shrimp and broccoli in it and he enjoyed it as well  they even gave bread  and grated cheese for his meal Overall will definitely come again soon.Hubby suggested we meet here for dinner since he's already around the area and I was on my way home. I made a stop here and the stop is just right next to the restaurant. There were a few people at the bar and some tables but this is in the bar section. The dining area was empty at the time because it was quite early. We had baked clams for appetizer. Hubby thought it was great, I thought it was good. For my entree I had bronzino and Hubby had a veal with Broccoli rabe sandwich. My Bronzino was perfect! Now we're talking! Hubby liked his veal sandwich. What we couldn't believe is the amount of broccoli rabe they put in the sandwich, humongous! The way they added in the sandwich was awesome too, with hot cherry pepper! I don't eat veal but I give them credit for being creative with the sandwich and the taste. My fish? Forget about it! I could have two bronzinos! But I couldn't. I loved my fish and I ate it all! This served with mashed potatoes and vegetable. Our waiter, I believe his name's Fabricio or Fabio, was a great waiter. He's from Italy! We didn't have time to interview him long enough. Find out more when you visit the place. We would try other dishes next time..A Dimond in the rough in this area. Old school interior and amazing service, with the decor being so nice and the service good, I almost expected the food to be a letdown, however this was not the case. Food was amazing. Barbra was an AMAZING server..Brooks is a place that we go to after work and everyone there is really friendly. The service is good and anything that I have ever had there from their nachos to their burgers are really good. It's a great place to hang out and have a few drinks and appetizers or a full dinner . The ambiance is relaxing with dark wood tables and dim lighting. You walk in and feel comfortable whether you are young or not so young and it's easy to become a regular."
"Cafe Con Amor is one of those consummate neighborhood spots that try to do a little bit of everything. They're not exactly a diner or a dedicated coffee spot, but a casual eatery with a semi-beefed up menu. After making my way here fairly often in the last year, I can attest they are certainly worth a look.As expected, this is a small'ish cafe with fairly generous but limited seating. (#1) The interior is simple, with a constantly changing menu on chalkboard for all to see. Given that dining in isn't an option at the moment, I'm pleased to note that they do offer takeout and delivery.One thing that immediately attracted me to their menu was the notion of an ""all day breakfast."" (!) We're talking biscuits and gravy, omelettes, breakfast burritos, pancakes, huevos rancheros, and even avocado toast as just one of many things they serve. I am definitely a person that enjoys breakfast for dinner and this place can fulfill that need with ease (and amor!).They also have a good variety of salads, sandwiches, wraps, wings, and even pasta and Latin inspired dishes like chicken milanese, quesadillas, and bistec a la Mexicana. The variety is impressive, but most of the food is not earth shattering. It's good enough to keep cravings at bay, but not enough to satiate one. (#2)I really did expect more from their drink selection, but the choices are limited to La Colombe Coffee and a standard variety of juices, teas, and such. No latte art or fancy caffeinated drinks here. They lean on the food bit quite heavily, so in some regard it's more of a restaurant than anything else.For some Woodside residents, there may be an element of sticker shock as many of the items (appetizers, entrees, etc.) are in the $13-16 range. However, the one thing that propels them to 4 star range for me has been their customer service. There have been some delivery snafus and occasional food mishaps, but they're usually on it to correct it and do so with a smile. I appreciate their good intentions and notice that they've been doing their best to keep up with things over the last few years. I can see myself coming here again and hopefully trying something different and delicious. __________(#1) A decent amount of people can certainly fit in here. But not *that* many ...(#2) If that makes any sense..Needed a pick-me-up and possible snack while working our way down Roosevelt Avenue. Settled on this spot which was empty on a Sunday late afternoon.Not much seating inside (and incredibly hot), so was going to get something to go. Settled on an Iced Coffee and Cappuccino between the two of us (total $8ish). More expensive than usual, but Nespresso coffee is always solid. Found the iced coffee to be on the milky end, though not too much sugar. Cappuccino was better, no sugar necessary as the flavor came through well. Wanted to get a snack as well, but the only options for something quick were a couple of older croissants from the morning.Might be a better spot to visit earlier in the morning for breakfast..My love for Cafe Con Amor began on a day long ago when I was stranded at home with minimal breakfast food and both cars gone. I put my trust in the hands of Seamless and they recommended CCA as a good place for breakfast delivery. From that day, history was made. I constructed my go-to order that I will always get whenever I am visiting Woodside. The sourdough toast with butter is a crunchy, soaked perfection that awakens my taste buds and preps my stomach for what's coming next. Their build your own egg sandwich is a solid choice and never disappoints. Egg whites and bacon on a roll will forever be my favorite combination. Finally, I wash it down with an iced Colombian coffee. Their delivery always says 30-40 mins, but I usually receive my food in about 20. I wish they were a smidge closer to Astoria so I would never have to make my own breakfast again..My girlfriend and I ordered delivery. The picture is of my huevos rancheros w/added chorizo and she ordered the breakfast burrito. Delivery was super quick! 20mins which was impressive for a Saturday morning. Now onto the two star part.... the huevos rancheros arrived as one big soupy mess. The ""homemade green sauce"" was actually enchilada sauce and was not served on the side like described. Instead it was dumped on top, which turned the ""crispy chips"" into soggy excuses of their former selves.I wish I could say it tasted better than the soggy mess it arrived as, however the force was strong with this enchilada sauce and overpowered any other flavors. My girlfriend didn't hate the breakfast burrito, but just know they go HEAVY on the corn. Like expect a full serving of vegetables in every bite.All in all, if you really like enchilada sauce to the point where you would enjoy it as a broth, this dish is for you!.Fairly decent weekend breakfast. With good service.The vibe was cozy. The only thing that would have made it perfect was slightly larger portions..Literally the worst restaurant I have ever ordered from. I placed an order that was never delivered and once contacting the restaurant to notify them, the manager yelled in the background, to the young lady answering the phone, inappropriately how he would not refund me my money. I am a nurse working in the city to battle COVID and after working 12 hrs I do not have the energy to pick up food nor do I want to be a danger to anyone. I paid for food along with a tip for delivering food in the snow that I didn't not receive and was also met with the most ridiculous attitude by the manager. He did not ask how can he rectify the situation or seem the lease bit empathetic. I will never spend my money here again and I hope that no one else does as well..Eggs Benedict: COLD! French Fries: COLD! & Hollandaise sauce: Watery! A very disappointing Easter meal! Thumbs Down!.Caesar Wrap! An Excellent Choice! Perfectly prepared, & seasoned just right! Large portion! AWESOME French Fries!.Chicken Club Sandwich + AWESOME French Fries! A huge portion, & the AWESOME French Fries are: BACK! A very tasty break, during a very HOT Summer's Day! A large portion, that can be enjoyed, in 2 meals! 5 stars!.Garden Burger with French Fries. Incredibly tasty, & filling! A GREAT buy!Perfect Year round, & specially as a Sunday treat!.I tried Cafe Con Amor's : BBQ Chicken sandwich today, & I plan to order it again, in the future! Delish! FIVE STARS!.A NEW addition to their menu is: Their Curry Chicken Wrap! Excellent! Very tasty, large portion + a side order with it! It can be, half for lunch, & half for dinner. Tasty, filling & delicious! I have posted a number of photos, & had enjoyed the curry chicken twice! Excellent!.GO VEGAN! Café Con Amor Vegetarian Wrap, with a side order, of French Fries!An excellent way, of getting a large serving of tasty vegetables!.I went here this morning on my way to the train. Upon entering, it is a cozy eatery. There were people working behind the wall / in the kitchen. It took two minutes before anyone noticed I was there. The menu looked interesting and they also have a chalk board up on the wall above the cashier. A girl came out from behind the wall, and she brought out a fresh batch of warm bagels and croissants. I ordered a large hot cocoa and a croissant with cc and jelly. Instead of taking one of the warm croissants in front of me; that I was eyeing, she grabs one from the fridge (probably yesterday's batch.) --------------That's mainly why I gave this place 3 stars! The lesser main point is that I didn't really try enough of their dishes or sit in to give a rave review! The menu looks standard with various American eats. I would go back sometime to try something else. Happy eats!.2 breakfast burritos with chorizo should not be 38$. It was just ok. Eggs over cooked. Mostly corn.  If we hadn't added chorizo the burrito is just eggs and corn..Decided to go for a breakfast last Sunday since me and my friend are too lazy to cook. I checked out Yelp to look for a brunch place then I found Cafe Con Amor which is not too far from our place. We decided to go and check it out. We got to the cafe around 12pm and no one was there. We sat right away while waiting for our server. She was nice and attentive with us and always ask us if we need anything. Though we checked the menu online, we practically know what to get when we got there. We noticed the difference on the online & actual menu price. We got the pancakes and the eggs Benedict. They were both good, the usual taste of a pancake and eggs benedict. We seated there enjoying our meal for as long as we want. My friend had a coffee and the server kept on pouring it (which was a good thing). We found a new breakfast spot whenever we don't feel cooking. Will surely come back to this place!"
"Breakfast Round 15 with my grammar school buddy who even at the tender ago of 7, seemed connected. Oh catholic school, shirt, tie and jacket everyday - the nuns - obey or get ruler cracked to the back of your hands.The feel was of a 1950s structure, having not had lived at that time, but I got the jist. For us, it was all about the order, the discipline and rules that were draconian - reflections seem to say more so now to me than it did back then. I digress, but diners were big in the 50s and continued throughout recent years but have since puttered out to a story or a table displayed in a museum.JT's has the feel of the older world of which I reflect so fondly upon. Pictures of malted's, creator leaning in wearing his white paper beret, prices ranging from a nickel to a half dollar. The walls seemed swollen of old world Queens NY - unfortunately no chrome which happens to be my favorite color - cant have too much Chrome is my motto and eat drink and be merry.Many menu items - it's not only breakfast but lunch and dinner too - nice variety of each - it's a place to revisit and eat through the menu and with the low prices, it's something I will be doing.Three Sunnyside up eggs - "" good day sunshine"" playing in my ears. No flipping nor covering! Don't hide the sunshine! The egg looked butter basted with the yolk done exactly as I like - the redneck in me was hoping for grits. Bacon lovers - cut with European efficiency - this bacon was evenly cooked and crispy so the extra side wasn't too much - didn't walk out with a pelican belly - all while conversation above & below the table, side hand mouthing and money passed - I really wasn't paying much attention to the shenanigans..Went to this nice diner got a DELICIOUS waffle wish i had a picture but i devoured it . i also got some sausage which was also great . Would definitely recommend coming here !! customer service was also great.Great breakfast but I think they are closed permanently. Last time had breakfast here was probably last April. I call and no one ever answers the phone. My favorite is the banana pancakes,turkey bacon with home fries and 2eggs. Coffee's and milk shakes good too but idk does anyone know if the changed their hours or phone number?.Honestly don't know why this place has such terrible ratings. Thank god I didn't find this place on yelp but on seamless or else I would have missed out. I usually get the corned beef hash with toast and fries and scrambled eggs. I also got the sesame bagel with mozzarella and pesto and tomato. This is the best delivery corned beef hash I've ever had! The pesto is very very very oily but the taste is very good. I definitely recommend this spot..Disgusting. Fries were super soggy. Burger was hard as a rock and delivery guy was a dick. Do not order from here..There's been a change in management recently and the quality of service is at an all time low. The servers are very nice and are very sweet however their attention to detail and attentiveness is lacking. Breakfast food is still very good.I mean it's the neighborhood diner I don't expect it to be extravagant but I've walked in and have waited upwards of 30 minutes to be waited on when there are two servers available and one rolling cutlery in napkins sooooooo....speaks for itself! Step your game up JRs!.nice diner. very clean. polite efficient service. decent prices. food simple but 100% honest. great value.nice diner. very clean. polite efficient service. decent prices. food simple but 100% honest.I was extremely concerned when they said my order was ready after 10 min since placing it on grubhub. I honestly thought the food would be cold trash...it was freaking amazing!!!! I will definitely be stopping here for lunch more often. Everything was very hot and tasty. I ate myself into a food coma and had to pull over for a bit. Their prices are absolutely reasonable for what you get..I slept over my friend's house & so we decided to get breakfast here in the morning. Let me tell you people! This diner has the best inexpensive food I've ever had! I got 3 of the most fluffiest and butteriest pancakes with scrambled eggs, sausage & unlimited coffee. All for less than $9! That's insane guys.      Although it was a tad bit busy because it was early morning, we were attended very quickly and our food got to our table in less than 15 mins. My friend got french toast with 2 eggs sunny side up & sausage. Unlimited coffee as well. I feel like this diner is underrated here on Yelp & should be getting more love from us custies ;)      The waitress was very kind to us which is always a plus on a busy morning. I have to come back to this wonderful place. I paid 1/2 of what i would pay at any other diner, Georgia's Diner isnt even as good and cheap as this one. Def. check it out for yourself.Best spot for breakfast! I've tried all places in the area with my roommate looking for the perfect breakfast and we found it at JR's. It's our go to spot for egg platters, French toast, pancakes and sandwiches. I love this place!"
"This was a pleasant surprise that I stumbled upon early Saturday morning after arriving from Virginia on Greyhound. The place was clean and presentable. The staff was polite and hospitable. The food and coffee was fair; hence the four stars. The waitress let me know of my options with certain breakfast items. The breakfast came complete with a glass of water, small glass of Orange juice with the coffee I ordered. The bathroom was unisex, so toilet and urinal were side by side (didn't bother me). Sink and soap dispenser were motion sensored and universally accessible. Handicap accesible with outside ramp. Reasonably priced. Will return..This place has the WORST food.....had an egg white omelette which was GROSS and tasteless. Would never return and never recommend.....AWFUL.I've been a customer since this diner opened for business. Back when it was JR's Diner. Despite the random mistakes with my orders, I would still continue giving them my business given the fact that this diner is the closest spot to my house and the food is pretty good. The mistakes are getting out of hand already. Sometimes I pay for something I don't receive and that causes my delivery person to make a second trip to deliver my missing items. Sometimes I ask to remove certain toppings from my orders that I do not eat and the person who takes the orders either doesn't listen or takes matter in his own hands and does whatever he wants. Sometimes I order something and then I'm told I wasn't charged for it so they aren't sending it. I had to tell this guy I don't want anything free, I'll pay for it ... Just send my freaking items I asked for! Please reconsider who takes your phone orders. Otherwise, dine in experience is awesome and the food is delicious."
"The servers are fast to take cares of the numerous orders. It's pretty busy with not only the patients families but also the Hospital staff, security guards, Doctors & nurses.The store is neat! Impecable! The servers are being polite to Hospital staff and costumers. This new Starbucks restaurant is located & found inside the Presbyterian Hospital at 168 street & Broadway.  The trains that are close by are the A/C, & 1.The servers are fast to take cares of the numerous orders. It's pretty busy with not only the patients families but also the Hospital staff, security guards, Doctors & nurses.The store is neat! Impecable! The servers are being politeStore New Location @ Presbyterian Hospital In 168th Broadway in Washington Heights. Train A,B and 1 or 9 are just in that corner..On Saturday Oct.23 my family & I visited this store to grab a coffee before starting our day and we were met with attitude and sass from Nova (on bar) and the Manager (Kenya).  My partner is a Starbucks employee and so we have his # to get a small discount. Comments were made by both employees "" get out of here with that shit, and he's just mad"".out loud passively so we could hear but not speaking directly to us. When confronted we asked for the manager and we asked that we be treated appropriately. Kenya (with attitude) says ""I'm the manager""  she didn't make eye contact, dismissed us, and never apologized for her behavior just kept giving attitude and working cleaning things up.Also no stoppers were at the counter, we asked, nova she said upfront, we went upfront to find no stoppers, asked again she just shrugs and ignored us. I've always had horrible service at this store, but this really topped it all. Never have I seen such rude behavior to me (non employee) and to a fellow employee. Will be calling to speak with GM..There is never order ahead.  Why does Starbucks, billion dollar business not have order ahead.  Then when you come to store, lines are very long.  I work in hospital and really cant use my time to wait for coffee.  This is really unacceptable.  Im bringing my own coffee from now on..The attention is horrible this was my favorite place but today I went and order there and the barista was preparing my order with a bunch of ice and I clearly said no ice but he said ""I know what I'm doing"" and when I received my order it was very very cold and I ask them why and they said there is only a few ice cubes My ordered a very very light ice drink and she received a cup with 75% ice Their attention is disgusting and is so sad because they had the best workers and now everything is so changed.My favorite Starbucks so far!!! Great costumer from all of them especially from Sabrina, scarlet and Reimy..I went in here. The Barista started talking about my mask. She was clearly working for that tip. I didn't mind because I've been in customer service roles before. But as soon as I gave my tip and walked away--I could hear her and the rest of the employees nearby making fun of me and my mask. Point being--if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all. And I'll never tip here again..They NEVER get my order right. Never. They don't read the special instructions. And they don't even follow the options that you put on the actual order. I even one time called the manager to walk them through my order to make sure I get what I ordered. And they still managed to mess it up. Smdh..I never give Starbucks 5 star reviews because I work here and I always encounter snobby partners . This was not the case here . Not sure if the store was small but the partners were really friendly. A young lady Sabrina offered me one of her drinks because I get the same drink every time and I wanted something different . The drink was amazing . She also did the liberty of marking my drink, coffee bean and my food item out so I didn't have to pay which I thought was lovely . She was super friendly and upbeat and I wished all her partners were like her . The store was super clean and they also had the Thanksgiving blend whole bean coffee I've been searching for so I was also super happy about that . A nice experience and nice partners ..If I was writing this review a year ago I would probably give this Starbucks location 1 star. But I have to say the really upped their game when it comes to staff, drink quality and outdoor and indoor safety. Although the wait time for a drink can be a little longer than expected, they make your drinks and prepare your order with care, considering how many people are rushing into the location all the time at once.This Starbucks is also doing a great job of keep unsavory folk away from customers, which is a big problem in this neighborhood.I always have a decent experience here, and recommend it to anyone who needs to stop for a drink..Let's be honest anything above 116th street on the westside in Manhattan is TRASH! Of course the Starbucks in the area are not going to live up to normal American standards. Being friendly, pronouncing names correctly, a sense of urgency, high level of hospitality, etc."
"Had such a great night here, truly an amazing experience for both jazz fans and those who just want to have a good time. Drinks were great and the place feels like you're time traveling back to the 50s. Great place..Finally visited a legendary spot. Good drinks and so-friendly waitstaffs. Good vibes all around.The session could've been a bit longer, guess the band was tired doing the 2nd skit..We LOVED our evening at the Village Vanguard yesterday; wonderful this 87-year-old institution run by the daughter of its founder can be back in the beautiful business of hosting marvelous jazz. The staff was welcoming, flexible, and patient. And the Dayna Stephens Quarter, which is performing through the 27th, was sublime: gorgeous music and lovely dynamics among the musicians..The Village Vanguard is legendary for its historic beginnings and being the main venue of many famous jazz careers from the 1940s to the present:  Jazz icons, Miles Davis, Thelonius Monk, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Sonny Rollins performed and recorded here.Established in 1935, the basement level triangle shaped tiny room remains the same today. People from all over the world still line up for the many artists performing nightly.It's a tight squeeze once you're inside, but a good place for jazz enthusiasts and being historic landmark venue. It is not my favorite venue for jazz due to its small space, but we were there to see the multi-talented Renee Rosnes Quartet. Well worth it! **$35.00 cover, plus one drink minimum charge.  No food or snacks served, so eat before you go. Sets are 8:30pm, 10:30pm. Doors 7:30pm**.Cancelled show after I purchased tickets. For ""maintenance"". No offer to help me get into another show. They could care less..$35 per person plus one drink minimum. Beers are about $8 and my Prosecco was $11. Definitely reserve online and arrive about 30 mins before the show starts. We came on a Wednesday night to see the Javon Jackson Quartet. Excellent 75 min set that started at 830 pm. The space is small so I can see how cozy it would be when packed but it's like any other music or stand up comedian venue - they are all tight for space. This one is in the basement so you enter a small door and within a foot you're heading down the stairs. Sound was great and server was prompt and friendly. Great night in a Greenwich Village institution. This place opened in 1935 and became a jazz lounge in 1957. JAVON JACKSON QUARTETJavon Jackson (saxophone)Jeremy Manasia (piano)David Williams (bass)McClenty Hunter (drums).Oh how lucky do I feel, having the opportunity to experience a great jazz performance at this storied venue!What an intimate, unique place to watch a concert. The seating is maybe a bit awkward, and the sightlines may be a little restricted, but in a way, it makes you appreciate the music more. It makes you focus on what you might not normally focus on.The show we were at, Jon Batiste, was pure magic. The crows was engaged, and the music was electric. The rumbling of the subway below during the quiet parts of the show just added to the wonderful vibe..Wowwwww, to think that we ALMOST didn't make it here because of an idiot tour bus driver who made us late to our dinner.  We knew to get here early, but instead, we were the last ones to arrive before they closed the doors...... and yes, we did get the WORST seats in the house and couldn't see a thing...... NOT ONE THING of them playing..... but we heard it all.  The sound acoustics were fantastic.  Wonderful Kenny Barron Quartet on Christmas night.  Great way to spend the holiday.  They were all excellent musicians, but I have to say, that drummer blew us away.  I'm just sorry we didn't get to watch what he was doing.  I have never heard a drummer play with so much intensity, vigor, and mastery.  He truly kicked ass.I was mildly annoyed that we were forced to order drinks when we already paid a hefty price to be there... but we had to do it.  Seats were packed in like sardines; that was not unexpected but still didn't like it.  That was the only good part of having the worst seats in the house... we were set apart from being packed in, and in fact, had a little extra room for not being able to see the stage.  As I sat there, just listening, I thought about the fact that a lot of jazz history has been heard in this room.  It was really cool to be part of it for one night..No photos allowed as to keep the intimate and sacred experience. Get tickets in advance and arrive early to get a good table. You will be in a tight space and you will be sharing a table with others, but you'll get the better angle if you get there early. I was entertained and enjoyed my time here. The 10pm show was perfect as to have dinner beforehand and with the option to go out after if so inclined..I have been going to the Vanguard - my husband performed there for many years. Actually, he was playing on our wedding night in 1965. It is the best jazz club in the world and it feels like home to me. Jane Hall"
"One of the best pizzas we had !!!!Amazing ! Tasty !!!And the staff OMG KINDEST PEOPLE EVER !!!We will visit for sure again :)...Akim YOU ARE THE BEST.Pizza was pretty good! They were just a little slow at making it and it could have been in the oven for a little longer. The personal pizza crust is thin and crispy and the care put into the sourcing and variety of toppings is nice. Tasty and you don't eat it all and feel guilty :)  The create your own option is solid but they had good looking pizza options on the menu too..Oath pizza is awesome. Love the gluten free crust. All the toppings are fresh especially the fresh garlic. I delightfully have stinky breath after eating their pies.  What makes Oath a place to visit frequently is the staff. The staff are friendly and energetic. They are really into making sure you have a great experience..Oath's Pizza was put on my radar thanks to a Yelp event I attended unfortunately location wise it's not very convenient to me so I can't stop by often. I happen to be in the neighborhood at the place next door & of course had to  come in for a bite.I had a buy one get one coupon thanks to my friend & another yelp event got the Walley & the Impossible pizza. Love me some Walley, great tasting crust the basil pesto & mozzarella plus roasted garlic are a great combo! I wanted to try a different one The impossible pizza was actually very tasty the meatballs were good with the fresh basil, spinach & cherry tomatoes. I really like the different sodas they have the Orange was great & so was is the black cherry one. Love me a good thin crust pizza & this place definitely gives u that great combo, small location , good service & reasonable prices..First experience review, dining in for lunchtime- damn, this thin crust is delicious. It's got a flaky quality like a pastry, it's unlike anything I've ever had. That being said, ratio is important- a delicate crust requires delicate toppings, otherwise it flops and becomes soggy, defeating the purpose of a thin crust. Go easy on the cheese!Otherwise, the customer service is amazing- Tyshawn was attentive and super nice! He clearly cared about my experience during a busy hour..I love path pizza. Since I've been on keto this is the only pizza that doesn't knock me out of ketosis if I order the cauliflower crust and eat half, I'm good!  I typically order the build your own selfie and love it. It's small, thin and crisps up well. Delivery is great and always friendly!.The organization here needs to work on customer service. After my delivery order got canceled, I was given an unreachable phone number to contact to fix the issue. The phone number ended up telling me to send an email to their customer service for support, which to this day I have not received an answer because apparently they're sooo backlogged with that as well...So I never got my pizza and spend some time with the credit card company to dispute a charge for pizza. So yeah...order delivery at your own risk..I recalled this pizza chain as I've been to a Yelp event back in 2018 at their UWS location. Strangely enough, I was randomly craving for some pizza, specifically this specific brand. At the end of the day, I order three different pies to split between four of us.We got the Luau, Spicy Mother Clucker, and Muffled Trushroom. The Muffled Trushroom is very rich in mushroom taste thanks to the truffle sauce. It's a very solid pizza for the limit toppings. The Luau is the equivalent to the Hawaiian. My favorite is the Spicy Mother Clucker, which is like the Buffalo Chicken. All of the pizza after consumption does not leave you with that heavy, greasy feeling a typical pizza would.If you want to give them a try, I'd order on their official site. They'll give you $10 off if you order $25 or more or free delivery using the provided promo code..There is a male employee not wearing his mask today while preparing my food. I kindly asked him to put it on but he said this is this their store policy so he doesn't have to. He added if I don't agree with that then I should go eat somewhere else. While the delta COVID cases are rising in NYC now, people who get vaccinated doesn't mean 100% safe. You still have the chance of getting COVID. So wear your mask please.  Protect yourself and protect others..Pizza to die for. Akeem was a rock star. Will be back. This will make your life complete.I've always been happy with Oath pizza. But today's visit was outstanding!  I received extra special attention from Akeem and Destiny! My pizza was brought out, as I was double parked. I haven't visited this location all summer, but after today, I will certainly be a more frequent visitor! Thanks to Akeem!-Andrew F."
"Still the best bargain in the town. Delicious as usual. Highly recommended. Great for a regular spot when you just need good food. Not just pizza but they have a full menu. You gotta try zestys on third Avenue. This place has been around even though they moved and they are newly renovated. Like I said highly reccomended.This place has great food and good service. For a very good price. I really enjoyed my experience there.They used to have really good pizza.  Went a few days ago and they must have changed the ingredients  or the way they make it .  The dough was thick and chewy and really made you not want to continue eating.    Also the cheese is not as good.  It is thick globs so when you take a bite the whole cheese comes off the the entire slice.  Previously you could eat the pizza and a bit of cheese would come off with each bite. I really think they must have needed to increase revenue. Prices were raised to 3.00 per slice and quality went down with cheaper ingredients .  I would not have minded a raise in price but when you cheapen the ingredients, would not go unless you are desperate for a slice of pizza. Used to love their pizza.  Too bad will need to look elsewhere ..I love zestys. While on the prowl for paninis I came across many bodegas. At one place the panini press was turned off, and at the next, they didnt offer pesto in their sandwich. Then came zestys! They make the perfect panini; mine was filled with fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil. Yum. Also I'm a sucker for hawaiian pizza and they always have it offered by the slice... it's like me and zestys were meant to be. The staff here are super friendly and they have a huge amount of seating here. I asked if I could rent out their patio but alas they said the neighbors complain when it gets too loud..Ummm- my chicken in the chicken parm was disgustingly chewy and inedible. The ""Fried Oreos"" advertised are a ball of fried dough without any sight of an Oreo.This place is horrible ?!.Love the hours you show as being open - perhaps you could pay for phone service? As that's the only reason I can presume you don't answer? #DeliveryIsNotHelpfulifYouHaveToWalkUpToRequestDel­iveryBecausePhoneIsOnUnansweredRing.Zesty Pizzeria & Salumeria you are truly amazing, I had a wonderful experience here today. The look of this place is really nice. When I saw the menu I wanted to order every thing, I went for Calzones and it was extremely yummy. Staff is really friendly and will help you with everything. Delightful..Rude counter person. We had to wait for a slice for my son as the people behind me got served first. He didn't even let us know it was ready, he just served the people that came after us. Rude attitude. Not a kid friendly place. Will not return..Reliable pizza, friendly service, open late. I was hungry and went into Zesty Pizzeria this evening. The gentleman behind the counter explained that they are open until midnight. How great is that?! For a Wednesday, I was impressed. Their selection of pizza slices was limited but he offered to make me a sausage slice even though they didn't have any in the display case.  Ordered:Fresh tomato and mozzarella slice ($4)- this slice had a slightly sweet tomato sauce, ripe fresh tomato slices and a generous amount of fresh mozzarella cheese. It hit the spot. Sausage slice ($4)- this slice had a thin layer of tomato sauce, topped with shredded mozzarella cheese, slices of Italian sausage and a little more shredded cheese on top. They really were generous with the sausage, it covered the slice! Also, the crust was crispy. A plus in my book. I should point out that it is a nice looking place with exposed brick walls and red accents. If you are looking for a pizza shop in the east 90s day or night, check out Zesty Pizzeria..This pizzeria has a large seating area with a TV. They have a good selection of pizzas.  The staffs are friendly and attentive.   I got a plain slice,  I prefer a little more sauce on my slice..11/11/18Exactly 2 months later, I eat at Zesty's again. lol Got into NYC about 5P. I95 North was  Mad. It was not a safe drive at all. Anyway, get here and it's always the same.......What am I in the mood to eat! Didn't want anything big so we went to Zesty's. No pix. Sorry. Forgot. I was so hangry (hungry + angry). They didn't have Veggie slices so I got a spinach and mushroom slice that was very good. I love spinach. Also the BBQ chicken slice. Why, I don't know. I like BBQ sauce on ribs or chicken parts, not pizza. I wasn't a fan. Had it been fresh I could of got with it. The chicken was hard and rubbery. Pizza was probably made early in the day. The buffalo wings were good. I liked the crisp and crunch of them. I like the decor. It's clean and the staff are friendly.Happy Eating 9/11/18This night in NYC was soooo nice. I was actually resting in bed and decided to go for a walk. It had been a rainstorm the previous two days. Awful. The rain wasn't great, but I brought ONE pair of shoes. The ones I was wearing. That is what was awful. My shoes/feet were soaked. The footwear places in the area was closed and the next day there were only sneaker spots. I had to dry on a dryer. Ghetto!!! - LOLMy shoes dried at this point, so taking a walk was fine. We stopped in TOZ pizzeria. I had a veggie slice. It was good. The veggies were fresh.""T"" had a meatball sub. It wasn't great. The sauce was fine, but the meatballs were not. The rolls they used was soft.They also sell pasties. So perhaps a muffin for breakfast or something sweet for dessert.Would I go back again? Yeah, I would. Happy Eating :)"
"Omgeee!! I'm so happy I came across this vegan pizza spot. I was on my way home and stopped in for a couple slices. They have a ton of options so I got the Buffalo chicken and Italian sausage. You can have them heat it up there or at home. The vibe inside is chill, with a blue color palette for decor and lots of seating available. The slices they give you are ginormous and every bite has great flavor and equally distributed toppings. The flavors on both were really delicious and I wish I had gotten an entire pizza for both. Whether you're vegan or not, this is a great spot to check out..It pains me to write this.But the last few times I've gone they've been out or very low on thousand island dressing. This is important because it's on the Reuben and the Cheeseburger - the best flavors for me. The rest of their flavors are just alright for me.If I'd written this review 45 days ago I'd tell you that these two pizzas are game changers. Mind blown. Excellent.I'd have told you that screamers white pizzas end up with the most amazing crusts - decadent bubbles, fluffy and chewy in the best way, great for dipping in extra sauce.I'd have said 6 stars, best vegan pizza ever.But today I'm upset. I've had enough. I'm not going to drag myself to either location from manhattan any longer just to be told they are out of the sauce that makes their two best pizzas AGAIN. You've broken my heart one too many times.To elaborate: I stopped in today to get some pizza for my birthday.I decided to skip going to clementine bakery to get cake for my occasion because Screamers had special chocolate zeppoles with pb sauce. I love their normal zeppoles so was excited for a special flavor. I got home and there was no peanut butter sauce plus my zeppoles were hard all the way through and tasted burned! No. just no. Maybe this is my fault for trying to have a fried item travel - but also they gave me my zeppole order so I thought my pizza was almost ready. It was another 25 mins before it was!!I was there for 40 minutes (from order to departure) - I would have ordered ahead but nobody ever picks up the phone and I try not to use apps in order to save the restaurants profits.I got a large pizza and when it came out of the oven I saw it and tried to get them to give it to me before it could sit on top and get crispy. But I noticed nobody had put sauce on it (despite me asking for extra sauce). I had a confusing conversation with the pizza maker. And just my luck there was only enough sauce for half the pizza. So I bought veganaise and made my own special sauce at home. But if I hadn't noticed the lack of sauce when they were boxing my pizza I might have just taken the closed box all the way home before noting this egregious error. That would have been infuriating.Get a vat of thousand island. order on subscription. Whatever you need to do to get that stuff prepetua-stocked..Foul. Foul foul foul. Most disgusting pizza  I've ever experienced.Don't buy a slice here.Incredible.When you hear vegan pizza you don't typically think tasty, but this joint blew away that assumption.The customer service was great. They were very patient and good at explaining things.The pizzas themselves were delicious - which is great because a good vegan cheese is hard to pull off.We'll be back soon..Made it to Screamer's 10 minutes before closing - which is important for this review. Plenty of outside and indoor seating. Didn't really get a long look at the menu, as there was pizza by the slice in the window. The Screamer pie was 7/10 - a little too salty and not hot enough. The other pie slices were FREE, so an automatic 9/10. Would like to review again during prime hot pizza hours. **nooch in a shaker was a very unexpected, yet welcomed touch. #NoochGang.I'll EAT CHUCKY CHEESE PIZZA BEFORE I eat this pizza again!! In all my 40+ years of eating pizza, I have NEVA had a worse piece of pizza!! This(pic) is how the pizza entered the garbage and I don't throw out pizza! Idk if the Screamers on Franklin is being mistaken for the Screamers on Manhattan but it definitely doesn't deserve anything beyond ONE STAR. Now the pizza...Undercooked. Unidentifiable ""sauce"". Definitely wasn't tomato Flavorless.Toppings not prepped right. Crust...c'mon...how you mess up crust!?Now the place...No gloves wornNo masks worn...idc what CDC says Those who accurately gave the Franklin Screamers more than 2 stars don't know food!I WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE!!!I try not to give too bad of reviews but this is unacceptable!!!...and a sin to pizza lovers.We love a good vegan pizza option on Franklin Ave! The cashew milk cheese is SO good and creamy here - delivery from Screamer's always comes on time or even earlier, which makes it super convenient for those who live in the area. They have a very active social media team, so you can see what the shop is up to on the reg..We were in the area and wanted to try some vegan pizza. The pizza shop is quaint and has a cute vibrant blue exterior. They have a few tables inside as well as a few seats outside. All the pizza they have is vegan which impressed us!! We ended up trying the Buffalo and mushroom pizza. It was a little bit too ""cheesy"" but overall not bad! Also definitely a bang for your buck since the slices were huge and each slice was only about $4..Love the traditional pizza joint feel where you can get your by-The-slice pizza heated for you .So after going vegan I wouldn't frequent this type of pizza parlor, but I'm glad I stopped by and gave them a try!Their crust was both thin and crispy, thick and fluffy, all in the right places! The part holding up the toppings was thin but crisp and fork enough to hold up the toppings without flopping. The crust was fluffy like garlic bread.I personally love almond ricotta and cultured nut-based cheeses more than tapioca cheeses.But the Mac n cheese pizza is def a fun flavor to try!The Buffalo and White pizza are my favorites! Buffalo has all the zingy spicy taste of Buffalo wings enhanced with a creamy ranch.The wings are also very substantial. I would probably call them nuggets more than wings. But they have a thin layer of crispy outside, which is so nice. Definitely need to eat those ASAP though because when reheating later even know an oven the seitan expands and doesn't have the distinct layers as it does in the beginning. Thai Chili is a nice sweet flavor for those who don't want too spicy.Overall, I recommend this vegan pizza shop for that NYC pizza experience and for anyone who likes to try many flavors..I am NOT a vegan but may be at some point (or never!) so I decided to get some practice here. I called and placed an order for pickup and decided on the large Chorizo pizza with tomato sauce, chorizo 'sausage' crumbles, almond ricotta dollops, and jalapeños. The pizza was fresh and ready when they said it would be. Overall pie flavor: Very well-flavored all on its own. I didn't even need my usual garlic, chili pepper flakes, parmesan, oregano, etc,. Crust: soft and crispy in all the right places! 'Cheese': boy, the vegan cheese was sooo creamy and the almond ricotta feels and tastes really close to real ricotta (how'd they do that?!)Tomato sauce: not too sweet, not too salty with perfect texture enough to hold the pie in place (I swear I almost always cry a little whenever the toppings slide and fall off my pizza!)Chorizo 'sausage': never had pork before so I can't speak on what the sausage should taste like but this was my chance to try it out-- if this is what the real thing tastes like, I'm impressed and I want more. I can, however, speak on chicken and beef and can't wait to try the other 'meat' pies next time!The pizza was good the next day and reheats in the oven so well. I think I loved it even better the next day, and two days day after that (hey, I can eat a few days after if I want -- it's not like I can catch salmonella or somethin').Although vegan, it still has that New York style gourmet pizza feel and taste without all the hormones and/or preservatives, and gas producing ingredients (depending on the person!) that comes along with real cheese and meat that tastes oh-so-good but can be oh-so-bad. This pizza still has that 'devilish effect' because it actually tastes so good like the real thing that eating it actually makes me feel like a bad girl sneaking off to do bad things... I wanna do it again.If you're vegan, try it. If you're not, try it!"
"Second time at the restaurant and the food was very good both times.  Grilled octopus is probably the best that I ever had. The fried calamari was also very well cooked. The entries was also excellent. Has the feel of a nice neighborhood restaurant. Get the feeling that a lot of the patrons are repeat customers, possibly from the neighborhood, as it seems like a lot of the patrons know each other. The owner also seems to know quite a few of them. I'm not from the neighborhood, but nonetheless, the service was great and the owner even stopped by to inquire how our dinner was.The prices are very reasonable.It's become one of my go to Italian restaurants..I went to Dolce Vita with a party of 16 yesterday. I had to write a review for this  wonderful hidden gem. The food was delicious. The service was amazing. I have lived in this neighborhood foreverAnd sometimes when you want to go out you think Bay ridge for a great atmosphere and dinner, especially for a big group. But yesterday I can tell you that it was so enjoyable to stay near home, support a local business and truly eat a delicious meal!.The food was delicious! The service was amazing. The waiter even went through the menu in Spanish for my family who prefers speaking Spanish  I was impressed! My birthday dinner was great. Definitely found a gem nearby..After reading all of the great reviews we decided to give it a try. We are glad that we did. Service was superb. Food was excellent! This is now our new favorite spot!.Word: Amazing.  I mean from the second I walked into Dolce Vita it was a fabulous experience.  This is truly and neighborhood hidden gem of an Italian restaurant.  You walk into a lovely bar area and are immediately greeted by the owner, George.  A delightful person who was genuinely happy to say hello to his guests and prepare you for a wonderful meal.We were a group of 12 friends.   Joe, the regular in the restaurant,  hosted us and ordered appetizers to pass around including a Calamari - which was AMAZING and Mozzarella and Tomatoes, also fantastic.Sitting here was like being in an old school dining spot.   It seems like everyone here new everyone here.  And the newbies were welcomed to join the family.There were lots of main dishes going on around here and everyone was dipping into every thing.  Not even sure of what I was enjoying BUT, I was enjoying everything.Clearly, I should have been back already but sadly I have not.  I will and document more of the dishes.  Some advice though...  DO NOT fill up on the amazing bread...   Remember to leave room for a dessert, even if you have to share it..The last time I ate at the restaurant was in 2019 prior to Covid 19.The food and service was excellent then as it was this past Saturday night.My wife and I were joined by two friends who also enjoyed their evening.   My Doctor friend probably drove the staff and hostess crazy with his antics but a good time was had by all.   The food was excellently prepared. I had the Bronzino special which I would certainly recommend if it is offered again.   Thanks to the accommodating host and hostess  who make you feel you are right at home.   Of course we will be back again..My wife and I had dinner at Dolce Vita this past Saturday night.The food was excellently prepared and the service lacked nothing from the owners to the busboys. My wife still cannot stop talking about the Black Sea Bass she had. I had the Pappardelle with the mixed seafood, also excellent.We had not eaten there since Pinocchio's closed a few years ago but I am happy to recommend this restaurant to anyone who reads the reviews.We will  definitely be back. Thank you Dolce Vita..Delicious food and great customer service. Took my order to go since I am in town alone. Catered to my special instructions and were super friendly. To top it all off, nice packaging and food was super tasty. Will come back to dine-in when back in the area.It started off with me being bored @ home, I googled restaurants near me and this little gem was a couple of blocks away. Very fast service from the moment I walked in, by the time I took off my jacket, my drink was on the table lol. I began with an arugula and avocado salad which was awesome with the dried cranberries and smoked salmon w| shrimp. Hands down one of the best salads I ever had!! My main course was the seafood linguine and the best way to describe it is in Ebonics (that shit was hitting) lolll I do recommend here and I'm glad that it's in my neighborhood, I'll be back..It's really hard to find nice restaurants in the Canarsie area (and by nice I mean non-diners). Thankfully Dolce fits the bill. Although it's not terribly large, it is spacious enough to accommodate bigger groups and has a full bar. The staff is always professional, friendly and helpful. The food is perfect with warm bread to start. My friend and I both ordered the spaghetti and meatballs but substituted Angel Hair pasta with no problem. For dessert we shared the Spumoni Bomba (suggested by the waiter) and it was fabulous. Although Dolce is closed on Mondays, it is a welcome, classy staple to the Mill Basin/Canarsie area. I look forward to returning..It's really hard to find nice restaurants in the Canarsie area (and by nice I mean non-diners).    Thankfully Dolce fits the bill.

I look forward to returning..Since I wrote my original review, Dolce Vita has become a staple in our restaurant vocabulary. And now, due to the quarantine, we had to order delivery. You know how most restaurants find it difficult to keep the same quality in their delivery? NOT THE CASE HERE! The portions were just as generous, steaming hot and delicious. They delivered it with all the extras (grated cheese, ricotta and bread,)without asking for it. In these times we have to support our neighborhood businesses and I will certainly be supporting this one. Don't miss their grilled octopus! My fave! Great value on the steaks and their meatballs are delish. Thanks as always George!.What a fabulous place! My family threw me a surprise party at Dolce Vita this past weekend and we couldn't have been happier. First off, the restaurant is beautifully decorated, generally speaking. For our party, we had the private room in back. There were about 35 people in attendance, plus a deejay. The  room and set up accommodated us well for many hours of dinner and dancing. The room was lovely, the food delicious! The owner is warm and accommodating. It was a very memorable night. My family has dined there for dinner on many occasions and raves about it, so we already plan on going back next month for my mother's birthday. A true neighborhood gem! Have the calamari; it was delicious!"
"This place is an absolute gem! Old school Brooklyn, through and through. We sat down at around 9pm on a Thursday night, and were STARVING. Soon thereafter, the waiter brought out fresh bread and quiche to nosh on while we waited. Instead of butter, we got to dip the bread in ricotta. WIN.I ordered the Medaglioni Dello Chef, which was perfectly cooked veal with artichoke hearts and roasted red pepper with delicious roasted potatoes and green beans on the side. Everything was flavorful, and you could taste that this was food cooked with passion. My friends all enjoyed their meals as well, and all plates were pretty much licked clean.Then it was time for dessert! And out came the dessert cart. Yup! Did I mention this place is old school?On the way out, we were all greeted with friendly handshakes, asking us all to come again. And we sure will. Heading back there this weekend, actually! Yum and a half..The Penne a la vodka was absolutely delicious. My Chicken Scarpierello (sp?) was bland.The service was existent, but not spectacular. I find that any non-Italian who comes to these family owned Italian restaurants don't get much treatment.Clean place, bar at the front. they share space with a rental hall? I heard a DJ on the other side of the wall. Wasn't too distracting though.Maybe I'll be back if I'm in the area..After 5 years of coming here religiously for Christmas Eve dinner, my family and I were actually forced to walk out of here due to the unacceptable seating arrangements that were provided to my family of 5.  We were ushered into the party room to the far left of the main dining area where we would be sitting on folding chairs next to a barbaric family of screaming, running children.  We sadly ""assumed"" we would be sitting in the main dining area, but were told that we ""didn't specify over the phone as to where we wanted to sit"" and that we ""can not be further accommodated.""  Even after speaking to the owners, whom of which could honestly care less about our 5 year patronage, were trying to coax us to stay because why fuss over folding chairs?  Umm...I'm sorry $200 does NOT equal folding chairs.  Curt, rude, obnoxious, and unsympathetic..I wanted to give this place 5 stars based only on the owner who is your typical Italian grandma and I just love her, unfortunately I couldn't. If it wasn't for the owner I probably would have done 3 stars but I can't bear to hurt my new grandmothers feelings. The loss of star basically comes from 2 things: 1) The music. Great singer who has am amazing voice but the volume was WAY too loud for such a small place. We had to scream just to hear each other speaking right next to each other. 2) My sisters dinner was terrible. She ordered a chicken dish that normally would have a white lemon wine sauce and it came out slathered in a red sauce and in chicken pieces instead of chicken breast. She must have bitten into 4 sharp bones. Other than that one dish the rest of the food was great. I ordered the chicken with mozzarella and tomato, my husband ordered the veal Marsala and our friend ordered the fish special which was branzino. Another plus that we didn't know was that they have a BEAUTIFUL party room in the back that the owner took us back to look at. I would definitely do a baby or bridal shower or even surprise party in this room. It comfortably holds 70 people and is intimate without being crowded. I will definitely be back (even of it's just to get another hug from my new Italian grandma!)..What an incredible find. At a suggestion of a friend we took new friends from the Philadelphia area to this restaurant. We were greeted at the door by the owner who welcomed us like old friends. The food was authentic Italian cuisine and delicious. The atmosphere made us feel like we were at a family gathering with a ""wedding singer"" as entertainment. The price for all this was extremely reasonable. We will be making many return trips to this place..I went here as part of an office bridal shower for my bestie and we had a BLAST! On the specials menu, they actually had stuffed artichoke and it was delish. The flavor was great, i even shared with co-workers who had never tried it. I had veal rollatini with pollenta and it was tender and had a really good flavor, well worth getting. The waiter was friendy. When taking our order, he didn't say anything about the side vegetable, it just came with the dish. Everyone got broccili.There was also a live singer and she was singing some well none hits like Smokey Robinson and Neil Diamond. It was nice that the audience was singing too. Mr. & Mrs. owner were walking around and engaging with everyone at the tables. If you want good italian food, try Pinocchio's You'll like the food, i idid..I think this place is five star across food, service, and atmosphere. The food is really good, I especially thought the appetizers and desserts were outstanding. We had the stuffed artichoke, hot antipasto, salads, fried calamari, stuff mushrooms, and fried celery. All really good. For main course I had a special stuffed veal chop, that was topped with fried onions. Really special dish. Penne with vodka sauce and a pasta with filet mignon special was so rich and good! And the desserts--- well it was the best cannoli I have ever had. Also a key lime cheesecake and chocolate chiffon cake - the best. Aside from the food being really good the service was wonderful. The waiters were very nice and attentive. The food come out in perfect time. Joking, laughing, taking pictures with us. A free round of drinks and hugs and kisses when we left. I thought that for what we ate and drank it was a very good deal too. I grew up in NYC and have been to plenty of good Italian restaurants. But there was something very special about this place. I will definitely be back!.The food is always great.  Excellent chicken and seafood dishes.  Great staff and the owners are warm and friendly.I can't find anything else to say besides:This is the best penne vodka I've ever had. I literally can't eat it at any other place without being disappointed that it's not from Pinocchio's. It's not some trendy, make you wait two hours to eat five pieces of pasta, Zagat-rated place (I'm talking to you, every single Italian place in Park Slope.) Pinocchio's is beyond words authentic, delicious Italian..Very kind servers who are prompt and attentive. Food is delicious, fresh, made to order home cooked Italian. I tried Fusilli Mamma Mia and was quite pleased with its rich flavor. If you're in the mood for a homey Italian meal, this is the place and you won't be disappointed."
"Came to Arunee Thai earlier this afternoon.  We ordered the Thai Curry Fried Rice with chicken, chicken Pad See Eiw and chicken Pad Thai. All 3 entrees were delicious! Very tasty and fresh. The portions are very generous as well. Service was welcoming and friendly.  Definitely will be back. Thank you for such a tasty lunch, Arunee!.Hands down, one of the best services and most delicious food in the neighborhood. Their drinks, food and dessert are delicious. The restaurant is spotless and the tables are distanced where you don't feel too close to other guests. One the few neighborhood gems!.Really love this thai spot, came here with my parents bc my parents always want thai. But it was so good I had to bring my friends to try here too (this review is a combined review of food ordered from both visits -- i also realized i may have ordered over 50% of the menu...)Apps/salad- duck salad: my friend actually chose this and best app ever. Not really a salad, more of a duck in this delicious sauce with a side of some veggies. It's came in a tangy sauce, with a hint of sweetness. The duck itself was perfectly cook,  soft and literally melts in your mouth- chicken wings: originally I wanted to order stuffed wings, but unfortunately, they don't have so we settle for plain ol' wings instead. still fantastic and super crispy.- chive dumplings: the perfect snackeroos, perfectly fried and chewy and piping hot in the middle. This were gone quick at my table-mango salad: goes really well with the chicken wings, and to make it like we're on the street market of thailand, we ordered a side of sticky rice to soak up the leftover sauce. Entrees:- Pad See Ew: If there's one thing this restaurant does well, it's their pad see ew. They come with broccoli, typically comes with chinese broccoli, but there's an upcharge. Regardless, handsdown one of the best pad see ew i've had. - Fish in the Garden: so this is a recommendation from the owner, and I came back with my friend just to try this. And boy, did this dish NOT disappoint. Presentation was on point, the fish came out topped with mango salad which just paired so well with the lightly battered/fried fish. Dessert: - fried banana: when eaten alone, they're ok, but with a scoop of ice cream it's divine- fried ice cream: the outside dough/batter is a bit too thick, but other than that still pretty good (i mean it's ice cream how can it be bad?)- mango and sticky rice: a classic, not sure how they're still getting fresh sweet mango during this time of the year but i'll take it!.Wow!Service is quick and on point.Food is great!  Had the Thai salad.  Wonderful and the peanut dressing is the best I've ever had!Beef satay was perfectly cooked and the cucumber dipping sauce was delicious.The pad Thai khing with chicken was delicious and healthy.Pineapple fried rice was enjoyed.Overall I'm very thankful to discover this place and will be back many more times!!!!!.Nasty had the Basil fried rice served with worm.They are not clean will not be going back..I'm a Thai food fan, so eat at many places. So glad this is in my new neighborhood! They are a great dine in place (also do delivery). Nice big menu, need to go back and try the whole fish. Decor is super cute and space is clean and comfortable. Best LardNa I've ever had!! Cant wait to go back and try more. Will add that other star when I've had more-off to a great start!.My first time experience was perfect The next time I went back to have the same order it was so different I was so sad but I just took offf one star for that don't wanna be too mean coz I'm sure the next time I go it will be perfect again.We were fortunate enough to be invited to Arunee in mid-December for an unofficial Yelp holiday family-style dinner organized by Jeannie, with an amazing menu curated by Jeannie and Ben. Food: Very Good (4 of 5). Everything we had was well-executed. There were three memorable dishes for me this evening -- the Happy Hour skewers, an off-menu ceviche, and a beef noodle soup.Appetizers we shared:- Kung Chae Nampla: an amazing, off-menu ceviche consisting of raw prawns and Thai chilis. While others noted a significant level of heat to this dish, my portion didn't have any, but was still superb. My suggestion is to pair this dish with an alcoholic drink.- Shrimp Rolls: Thin crispy shell, not greasy.- Calamari: standard, well-executed. - Moo Dhad Diew (Marinated Deep-Fried Pork): a little dry.- Happy Hour skewers special: This had two skewers each of beef, lamb, and chicken -- the beef and lamb skewers were amazing -- juicy and flavorful, even without the dipping sauces.Drinks We Had, included:- Lychee Martini: Happy Hour version. Strong, good lychee flavor.- Thai Iced Tea: standard, very good.Main entrees we shared included:- Crab Fried Rice: Good; could use more crab. Crab flavor was subtle, if present. I thought this particular dish was somewhat pricey for what it offered.- Pad See Eiw: Good; unnecessarily sweet, in my opinion, due to added sugar.- Fish In the Garden: The fish was slightly overcooked, but beautifully presented, with a great range in flavors due to the lemongrass and sauce on the bottom of the plate.- Guay Tieow Nuea (Beef Noodle Soup), with Cow Blood: Superb. The common description across our tables was that this dish was similar to a Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup, but with intensified flavor.Of the desserts we had, I liked the Thai Ice Cream the most.- Thai Ice Cream (Coconut and Green Tea): Both flavors were creamy. The Green Tea didn't have its usual bitterness, while the Coconut was very flavorful.- Fried Banana with Honey: A nice combination of thin crunchiness from the thin deep-fried shell and mushy sweetness from the banana.- Pumpkin Custard: an understated dessert.- Fried Ice Cream: very good.Service: Very Good (4 of 5). The staff made sure we were happy, by giving us a change of plates, refilling our water glasses, and helping us take a group photo. Suggested tips on the bill were inconsistent, however, based on percentages somewhere between pre-tax and post-tax subtotals. Atmosphere: Very Good (4 of 5). Comfortable, moody atmosphere. There are two unisex bathrooms, with one having ADA grab bars. VPN-friendly Wi-Fi from the Starbucks next door is accessible through the walls, though it isn't particularly fast due to their volume of customers..A surprise find in the middle of Jackson Heights.  They make the most amazing, Guay Tieow.  A noodle soup dish that is a blast of bold delicious flavors.  A Thai style dish with flat noodles and choice of beef or pork muscles and the addition of cow blood for $1 more.  Yes!  I know that sounds weird but definitely get the cow blood.  It adds a dimension to the dish that is truly awesome.  I woke up this morning, saying to myself, "" I need to get more of this noodle soup!""A rich beef bone stock made from simmering for many hours with aromatics.  Add some flat noodles, protein and a few veggies and you have an awesome hearty meal.  Perfect for chilly weather.  Add a few balls of lard that are fried to a light crispy finish.  A perfect topper for the hearty soup.Guay Tiew:  (there are several ways this might be spelled in English) literally means noodles in Thai.Decor:  A modern semi lit, warm polished wood feel, decorated with Thai accents.They have a great happy hour with pretty strong drinks.  You know I need my lychee martini!  Get here early, before 7pm, to get in on the happy hour price..We always seem to come here in a large group!  I had forgotten we had a group lunch here a while ago and when Jeannie T. wanted to have a holiday dinner UYE, we jumped!  We came in at the tail end of Happy Hour, so was able to order some drinks and appetizers from the HH menu.  With a full dozen Yelpers, we got to try lots of different dishes that Ben L. handpicked for us and enjoyed family style.  With his insider knowledge and deep dark secret menu, he ordered more traditional dishes beyond the usual pad thai and was even able to swing an off menu dish.Starting with drinks, both alcoholic and non, there were Lychee Martinis, Bangkok Smashes, Thai Iced Teas & Coffees all around.  The appetizers soon came, with Grilled Beef, Chicken & Lamb Satay Skewers (w/ 3 dipping sauces), Fried Calamari, Sliced Marinated Pork w/ Sriracha Sauce, Fried Shrimp Rolls, Spicy Crispy Pork & Fish Maw Salad and Ben's surprise Raw Prawns with Thai Chilis.  Those chili peppers and the salad were deadly spicy and I was burning.  The creamy sweet Thai Iced Tea helped to cool the palate somewhat.Then the main and side dishes came and kept coming.  Thai Fried Rice and Cashew w/ Mixed Vegetables weren't spicy but flavorful.  Wide rice noodles were featured in 2 dishes, the Pad See Ew & the Beef Noodle Soup.  I didn't find out until later that the soup was beef blood based but I was able to identify 3 different meats with beef meatballs, flanken and brisket.  The highlight was the Fish in the Garden which was a fried Red Snapper.  The fillets were deep fried in chunks and served in a spicy & sour dressing with herbs & young mango.  Make sure to pile some of the herbs and mango on the fish to get the full flavors.  I was tempted to take apart the head and rest of the body, but I was pretty stuffed.Of course we had to finish off the dinner with dessert family style: double portions of Coconut & Green Tea Ice Cream, Fried Coconut Ice Cream, Fried Banana Rolls w/ Honey & Pumpkin Custard with plenty of spoons.  My favorite was the Fried Ice Cream, complete with whipped cream and topped with a Maraschino cherry and paper umbrella.Good company always makes good food taste better and this was a fantastically fun evening for all of us.  Thanks to Jeannie & Ben!"

"Mash a Chinese spot that serves, pick 3 items over rice/ noodles, with a hole in the wall dumpling/ street food place, & Broadway Snacks is what you'll get.  Slightly off Broadway, right near Kung Fu Tea is this inconspicuous little shop. If you're seeking a hearty meal/ snack, that won't leave you broke, this is where ya wanna try..Omg. I work at a dental clinic near this place. My coworker and dentist always buy food from here. It's so good. The price is cheap but the food is so high quality. I love it so much..Food is always cheap and delicious.  I've been going here since I've moved to Elmhurst.  For under $5 you can get steam buns , dumpling Lo Keun, or pick 3.  All good choices ..Good food, very affordable. The fried dumplings are so tasty. It never disappoints..This place is a classic example of why you should never judge a book by it's cover. Does it look grimy from the outside? Is it no frills inside? Yes...and yes. But the value you get for your money here is so worth it! By far, one of the cheapest places to get a good size meal. For only $5 you get rice or noodles, with a choice of 3 entrees and soup! Is it greasy food...hell yea! But you don't come here looking for gourmet Chinese cuisine. This is stick to your ribs, hangry type of food. Plus, they have fresh steamed pork buns (4 for $1.50). You could spend $10 here and feed a family of 4!!! Plus, the ladies behind the counter were super friendly to us. This will definitely be a go to spot when I'm hungry and low on cash. P.S. it's cash only..I was doing some after Christmas shopping at queens mall and walked home . I stopped my this place since I always grab a scallion pancake on my way . This time I got the 3 choices with rice or noodle with soup ! Being a picky vegetarian I love their food ! It's so flavorful and healthy and plus the portion is huge ! I am bringing my friends back here . The older Chinese guy who served is really sweet and nice reminds me my older uncles. He helped me with choosing since I don't speak mandarin nor Cantonese..I randomly came across this place after a doctor's appointment, and I thought the pork and cabbage steamed dumplings were so delicious. I got two for $2.50 which is a really good price, too. The food was so fresh, and the place was so clean!.The only place around here that offers bamg for your buck; besides the bakery a few doors down.Where else can you get a quite filling meal of three dishes, 1 soup and a base (white rice always) for only $5? I hope they'll stay around for a long time to come!.It's a small clean store with a friendly cashier lady! The first time I was trying to buy fried rice noodles (which there was only a little remaining) and she recommended I get the fried rice instead which was more frsh. I found that to be so thoughtful! The rice was quite filling and barely oily for such a cheap price. The second time I got chow mien. The noodles were fine but there was something off about the vegetables like they were either overcooked or spoiled or something...so I'm momentarily put off from eating anything there that includes vegetables for now. They alos offer a bunch of other Chinese snacks like fried cruellers, soy milk, etc..I actually kinda like this place... it's a hole in the wall with tasty, cheap food. Obviously not the best, but for $5, it's a really good deal... so I finally tried their 3 items with either rice or noodle and of course I chose Lo Mein with sesame chicken, some pork item and Kung pao chicken? I wasn't feeling well, was getting over a cold and normally I can eat pretty spicy food but my taste buds were a lil weird so the next night I must've had a bite of a pepper and although it was actually delicious but tongue was on fire! If I wasn't sick I would've thoroughly enjoyed the spicy food but sadly I couldn't finish it. L didn't like the pork thing. Wasn't that bad, just a lil dry. Lo mein was pretty good. Located conveniently near the subway. Will come and stop by and try other items. The lady that always works there is very nice and patient and she speaks English..3.5 starsNever knew this existed but I went to check it out since it had decent reviews for cheap snack items or perhaps a meal. Complete hole-in-the-wall.. L did not want to try anything at first but once we went inside and saw what was available... he noticed there was something that resembled a lightly baked empanada. I think it's called Chive cake on the menu. Wow.. each bite was full of chives.. a lil glass noodles? And perhaps a bit of egg. Very simple but actually quite tasty. A pretty good breakfast or snack item. Not overly seasoned, would definitely get it again since L loves chives. I also got 4 pan fried pork buns. I shared one. I didn't like the bun itself, but the pork was great. Probably better than the cheap place in Flushing that has similar ""dim sum"" items. My father prob ate the rest the next day, but my mom told me he also didn't like the bun. Tasted weird.The guy before us bought 4 boxes of entrees so either it's pretty good or nobody likes to cook at his house. Will come back and try more cheap eats! Also the lady serving the food speaks a lil English and she was nice so that's a big plus..My friend and I go here for the $5.50 meal specials they have on weekdays. I believe you get about 5 things in a box and an optional soup. The staff and owner have limited english and the food is not labeled on the glass, so I have a hard time figuring out what is what, let alone ordering and understanding. It takes a little longer due to the english barrier, but the price is great. Of course, the quality isn't the greatest, but it fills you up without burning a hole in your wallet. Drawback: Cash only (-1 star)"
"Fun dive bar,the beer and shot combo is unbeatable at the price. The vibe is pretty laidback and casual, I've had a number of great interactions/conversations with people I've met there all of which have been super friendly adding to the bars appeal..Bartenders think they're cool for playing Radiohead...BORING!!! Only giving it a star because of the photo booth...(if u use it make sure u wait for yr photo to print it takes 10 minutes!!) Anyways very pretentious which is odd since every time I've gone it's been dead....This is a bar that you need to be one of those Bushwick cool kids to get attention from one of the grumpy/drunk bartenders. 3 stars because of the pool table..Solid dive bar with a pool table and great music if you like rock n roll, punk and new wave which I do. Definitely my cup tea or glass of whiskey or whatever. Cheers..We came in oct 2nd right after indoor dining opened after covid. We had a male bartender, rudest bartender We ever met. A group of 4 of us walked in, however only 2 of us ordered alcoholic beverages and the bartender told us we had to get food with our order, we agreed and ordered one hot dog and 2 shots, the bartender agreed.he came back with 4 hot dogs and insisted we each had to eat hot dogs, although only 2 people ordered alcohol.  we corrected his mistake and told him, we ordered one hot dog & 2 shots, he immediately told us we were wrong and yelled at us to leave. It was disrespectful and unprofessional. It was an unwelcoming environment and the bartender was forcing us to get more than what we ordered. I would not recommend this place at all..My favorite bar in Bushwick! Bootleg just off Knickerbocker -- enough that you kind of have to go with a purpose, which is great if, like I was upon my first visit, you're looking for somewhere to have a few drinks and chill without being packed in like sardines on a Friday night. Brianna was a delightful bartender and fun to talk to. She was attentive to her full section rather than finding herself continually drawn back to one side at the expense of the patrons at another, which is something I pay attention to. The drinks were very reasonably priced and the ambiance was good for both solo drinkers and groups. The only thing that raised my eyebrow was the stall door in the women's restroom, as it's short enough that anyone who walks in could look over it. And if someone happens to walk in while you're standing to do up your pants, you're in for some awkward eye contact.Overall, though, I'm a huge fan and I'll definitely be back (regularly)!.Stylish, dim, and best of all, with a hint of danger, Bootleg is a hip watering hole masquerading as a dive bar where anyone and everyone can get into some trouble. I absolutely love the beer selection, with a dozen or so unique taps and plenty of cans as well. Really appreciate that they seem to keep it regional as well. Of course, there are some mixed beverages as well if you prefer liquor. The crowd is legit--you don't have the try-hards here (they are hard to escape in this hood), just cool under-40 folks looking to get as obliterated as myself. I spent most of my time on the narrow patio, which I loved. It's surrounded by high walls and graffiti, so it feels exclusive. There are even some small tables out if you're feeling inclined to spend some time one-on-one...not that I'd think this were a prime date spot. The bathrooms are hella weird...it's literally the darkest bathroom I've ever seen in any bar, ever. And I've written about hundreds. There was a suspiciously high number of people standing there, but what you do without supervision (or light) is your business. Overall, this is a quality spot for drinking and socializing alike. Staff are cool (you're a nice guy too, bouncer!), drinks are fairly priced, music is loud, there is adequate seating...everything I could want. Would definitely make this my top spot to have a beer in Brooklyn..Took my gf here as recommended  by though a friend. Perfect dive bar. I liked the live . Back patio is pretty dope too. Hidden Gem..This is a pretty chill bar for locals. I went here with a friend and everytime I go we have a great time. There is a pool table.::::Bathroom Alert:::I hate the bathroom setup. You can lock the door but sometimes someone always bangs on it. Its rather annoying. When you go there you will see what I mean.The prices are not expensive. The people who work there was pretty awesome..Been coming here for a few years now. Awesome punk bar with great music + cheap drinks. Staff is super cool and nice. 10/10 recommend checking it out for the PBR + shot special."
"I've went to Indian and Pakistani restaurants all over NYC but this by far has been the most authentic tasting. The meat was delicious and fresh. I've even reheated the good days later and still just as delicious !.Overall it was an okay experience. This was my first time trying masala. The meal was still piping hot even after the delivery which was surprising. Initially, I was turned off by the taste of the sauce. However, as I kept eating, the sauce grew on me, and in the end, I can say it was okay. The chicken was the best part of the meal. It was cooked perfectly to the point right before it becomes dry. For 12 dollars I can say it was a decent amount of food..Got a roach in the mint sauce! Definitely will not be getting food from this place anymore!.I love this place , this is the second time I order from them and the delivery has been quick and on point. The food is very flavorful, I loved their samosas , saag paneer , chicken tikka , lamb byriani ... The portions are generous and they are not cheap with their meat. I recommend it highly and don't understand the rating on yelp :/.Everytime we order from this place it is magical. They have the best samosas THE BEST SAMOSAS literally u have saved us so many times. In these dark times order paneer from these folks I guarantee you will never be disappointed. Love ya.I ordered through Seamless and it's not letting me rate and review there for some reason, so I'm doing it through here. Same same, I guess. Anyway, so I ordered cheese naan and chicken tikka masala, took them some time to deliver, but when it got here, food was still hot, so I thought the wait was worth it. I tried the cheese naan and it was freshly made and was so good.. but when I was transferring some of the chicken tikka masala to my plate, there was this long black hair :( too bad I didn't get to try it. I had to call seamless/grubhub customer service and they contacted the place, but unfortunately, they were closed. The, I'm guessing, owner told the operator that they will pick up the food the next day and LEAVE THE HAIR in the food before they issue me a refund. First of all, as soon as I saw that strand of hair, I already threw out the whole thing. That's gross, you know. And just the thought for them to request me to put back the hair is pure yuck. Definitely never ordering here again, who knows what I might find the next time.. for sure they'll do something even nastier to my food after they read my honest review. The other reviewer found paper, and I found hair. So guys, watch out, and spend wisely!.I ordered from Seamless last week, where it was under ""Halal Indian Food & Falafel."" Their lunch special comes out to $15.19 with tax (no tip yet) and includes one appetizer, one entree, rice, naan, and three different condiments. All in all, it sounds like a pretty good deal, especially since free (and speedy!) delivery is offered with a $12 minimum. I was very excited for my lunch because I ordered samosas, which are one of my favorite things to eat. These samosas were comically large and quite delicious. The crust was crispy and robust enough to hold all the smooth filling of curried potatoes and peas without getting soggy. However, the accompanying condiments were so thinned out to the point that they weren't really sauces anymore, but rather colored water. The cucumber raita didn't taste like anything, nor did the spicy mint pesto. The tamarind chutney had a slight fruity tang to it, but lacked viscosity. Although my chicken tikka masala entree had generous portions of chicken, it tasted drier than cardboard. The rice was not very fluffy but the naan was superb. I realized my tongue started feeling weird and tingly after eating the entree. I'm not quite sure what could have caused this sensation but as I have a tree nut allergy, I suspect some cross-contamination may have occurred. Indeed I spent the rest of the afternoon and evening feeling rather poorly. Overall, I probably would give Halal Indian Food & Falafel one star for the overcooked (and possibly contaminated) entree. The watered down condiments were also not very appealing. What is the point in including chutneys and raita if they lack taste? I'll add one more star because the delivery service was efficient and the samosas and naan were not bad at all. However, those with food allergies should be a bit wary when ordering from this establishment..Living in Sunset Park really happy to have this delivery option. I was perhaps spoiled with the options in Manhattan, but I have enjoyed all the dishes I ordered from here. Vegetarian (cashew and tomato dishes) and lamb (with spinach) dishes so far wonderful (they even provided some free nan when I didn't order bread). Going with chicken dishes tonight, looking forward to it..I order takeout from here quite often, as I'm just down the block.I love their biryani and tandoori but admittedly, it's been hit or miss. Fortunately, it's more hit than miss. :) The portion size is always nice but occasionally the meat is just on the dry side. When it's good though, it's GOOD. Please note that I've never eaten in, only takeout..I pre-ordered a lamb biryani and sweet lassi for delivery on grub hub and my food was absolutely delicious! Both the biryani and sweet lassi were made authentically and was a joy to eat. I'm a happy customer and will definitely order Indian food from here again! The only reason I'm giving 4 stares, instead of 5 is because my order came in after estimated time of arrival."
"Great selection of ices to choose from. I suggest the cannoli ice or toasted marshmallow ice. Warning though, they might run out of soft serve by the end of the night so if you're craving soft serve, I would recommend calling before. When I got there they didn't have vanilla soft serve so I had no option but to get the chocolate...such a problem I know :).Nothing like quenching the heat with a delicious water ice. They have a ton of flavors on the menu. So many terrific tastes. Soft serve twister cones, milkshakes, water ices, smoothies, sundaes, and more. All served out of a small storefront window. Very old school nostalgic. Good prices for the quality. They are really known for their ices but their soft serve is also very good. I just had a chocolate and vanilla twister soft serve cone and it was delicious. Perfect dessert during this hot humid summer..Terrible service. I have a nut allergy and they were unable to tell me what had nuts in. Waited 10 min for them to flip through a binder..We visited New York for a couple of days and stopped here for dessert.  Oh my freaking goodness, this is the best Italian Ice I've had.  It was so satisfying for a hot and humid evening.  I had mango and pineapple with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and pretty much devoured it within minutes.  Lol.  We all enjoyed our ice and were sad that we couldn't indulge for just one more day..Was really craving some ice cream the other night since it's finally starting to warm in in nyc. It was a Thursday around 8 and there wasn't a line. I got the chocolate chip doughnado. Ohh it was delicious! I haven't had soft serve in a minute and this was delicious. I would love to come back and try a milkshake sometime!.Ralph's is a true summer delight, and I'm so happy they're open for the season. The lines are just as long as they've ever been on a hot day, but they're totally equipped for covid times since they just serve their ices out of a takeout window anyway. You just can't sample the flavors right now, but it's hard to go wrong with their menu. You have refreshing options galore, from twisters to ices to ice cream to creme ice (yes they are different things) and the array of classic flavors will make you nostalgic for the carefree days of childhood. If you're like me and like texture in your ice cream or get ""palate fatigue"" when what you're eating tastes too homogenous throughout, I recommend going for the cookies and creme, graham cracker crunch, or salted caramel pretzel. I've enjoyed everything I've had from Ralph's but these are my very favorite flavors. I only wish they were open all year round because some creme ice is excellent any time of the year..I love Ralph's. If you are new to the area, it's similar to Jeremiah's or Rita's in Florida. It's super smooth italian ice. They have ""water ice"" and ""cream ice"" on the menu. To me, they taste super similar, so just go with whatever flavor you like. I like to order the ""twister"" which is layered italian ice and soft serve. Strawberry ice and vanilla soft serve is my favorite! Only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the twister is $7, which I find expensive for a counter place where you can't even go inside. Such is NYC. Although it doesn't stop me from going ! Also, order a small - it's huge..Open during Covid, Ralph's is doing a great job. Lots of social distancing markers where you can stand, not a long line, staff are friendly and quick filling orders...my only wish is that you can tip on your credit card, tips are only in cash. Both ice cream & ice based are delicious. Plus - there are to go covers as well..Just as good as any other Ralph's. Still open during covid times. It's hidden under some scaffolding.A medium can get you 3 creme ice flavors at $5.75.Some good flavors I recently had:Pb cookie doughRainbow cookieChocolate fudge brownie.A wide selection of delicious flavors, shakes, ice creams, and ices - it made my decision very difficult my first time trying! (What a problem to have, ha!) The staff was very kind & fast with their service, and the price was cheap compared to surrounding ice cream shops in Gramercy. I highly recommend!"
"I came in after seeing the menu and not knowing what to expect but I really wanted something healthy! I spoke to the women working and I really wanted the protein bowl but I had to do a lot of walking and couldn't sit and stay. She right away turned it into a smoothie for me and it was AMAZING omg like so yummy! I'll definitely be back.Waste of money. There was barely any fruit in my bowl, not even a tablespoon of almond butter, and the base was so bland it tasted like water with pink food coloring in it. Not to mention the base was VERY runny/watery. Definitely not worth $14 NOT including tax, tip, and delivery..... I paid almost $20 for this bowl when I could have gotten 2 elsewhere that i'd be much more satisfied with for the same price."
"Delivery was prompt. My eggs were cooked to order. I wasn't impressed by the tortilla because it had an aftertaste. The shrimp quesadilla was tasty They sent me a complimentary dessert Thank you.I ordered takeout from this restaurant. My order included 3 tacos: 1 taco de lengua (tongue), 1 taco de carnitas (pork), and 1 taco de asada (steak), flan, and a torts de milanesa (beef). The torta was the best! It had lots of guac, beans, lettuce, and the flavor was exceptional! I would order this again. The tacos I did not like at all. I don't like tomatoes on my tacos, the tortillas were pretty cold, and the meat was not good (at least the tongue one wasn't and I am a huge fan of tongue tacos). From the tacos I only really enjoyed the pork ones (carnitas). The flan was ok. It wasn't very sweet, which some people may be okay with, but for me it was missing the caramel flavor that tends to be included in flans. Overall I might give this place another try, but the tacos will be a no for me next time.Ordered delivery. One of my entrees was missing. Called restaurant. They argued with me saying it was in bag. It was not. Then they hung up and would not answer phone. I will never order from them again!.This restaurant is a hidden gem. It is family owned & operated. They really care about the customer and are willing to get your order right. It is like an authentic Mexican taquilla, including the loud music..This is the 4th time we've been here, and it's yet to disappoint.  We've become big fans of the empanadas, both the beef and chicken.  The beef and rice dishes are filling and very tasty. Today we had pepper steak and I was amazed at the tenderness of the beef and fresh snap of the onions, along with heaping portions of perfectly cooked yellow rice and beans.  Top it off with a couple of Goya soda's (I know, not a fan of the campaign contributions this company makes) and it makes for a very satisfying meal.  Two other thoughts here: I like supporting local businesses, and this has the feel of a family operated place.  I also get the feeling that it's best to visit earlier in the day, as they likely run out of some items before days end..I ordered tostadas to go & they came stacked on top of each other. Soggy. Thrown together. WASTE of my money..Disgusting soupy guac. Soggy steak burrito. They gave me a OPENED  plastic cutlery set to go without the fork. I will NEVER waste my time at this place again.Friendly place but cash only. A good thing is they close at midnight. The taco was ok, will try other food next time..The food was decent, not bad just not great. I will try something different in the menu next time and see if it's any better. Delivery was on time so that's a plus. Update: I ordered from here a second time and I was not impressed with the taste and quality of the chicken burrito. The chicken was sort of rubbery and lacked flavor. Overall it was it was pretty bland. The chips and salsa were also a let down unfortunately. The salsa had the consistency of water, and it was so liquified I couldn't scoop any of it with chips. It was like dunking them in a blood bath..The food was decent, not bad just not great. I will try something different in the menu next time and see if it's any better. Delivery was on time so that's a plus..Second time eating here. Had the Mole burrito first and it  was pretty bland. I always give a place a second try so I tried the burrito con al pastor. Meat was pretty dry and I asked for added avocado and they forgot. Unfortunately I won't go back."
"Fried cheese curd is to die for!! Fantastic bartender. Fantastic craft beer selections. It was a quite cold winter Thursday...can't beat that! Really don't want to share...but!! Come on by and enjoy...Cheers!!.We stopped in here for a quick bite...I hadn't eaten lunch so was plenty hungry...I ordered the BC burger medium rare to rare with a side of fries and my friend ordered a cheeseburger well done. Sacrilegious in my eyes but I'm not going to judge my friend. A stranger on the other hand, I have no issues doing that. Once our food arrived (it took a while and I'm not sure why since it wasn't busy and they're just burgers) we dug in. Being very hungry I didn't stop until a bunch of bites to notice my burger was well done..I think it was disguised under the spiciness of the pimento cheese and possibly the jalapeños. At that point, I wasn't going to send back (hate doing that) since I ate a third of it...cause I was so hungry,  but what a disappointment. Maybe the sever got our orders confused? But then again, maybe he should have been written down which he didn't do.Burger had a lot of potential and in my mind was ruined by overcooking. I also think the option of meat being well done should be banned but is that too extreme? The fries were lukewarm, bland and nothing special. Clearly came out of some kind of cheap frozen bag from the supermarket. I rarely give negative feedback on restaurants/bars, especially during such tenuous times but clearly the staff is just dialing it in. It was one of the most unsatisfying disappointing cheeseburgers I have ever had. And the service was so-so....there's nothing special about Gebhards and I won't be back..I hesitate to post a review at all because it perhaps is unfair to rate a beer bar on anything but the beer.  The beer selection is pretty good, with a number of draft choices and tons more by the bottle.  The vibe is also very good - casual neighborhood bar, some games upstairs.  The food is, well, let's just say that my three-star rating in this review is the result of averaging five stars for the beer offerings and one star for the kitchen.  I would absolutely love this place if they put some effort into the food.  Until then, it's a great place to stop for a beer before finding something to eat somewhere else!.The chicken tenders and fries from here were decent. My friend ordered the Chicago dog also ok. Would not recommend the poutine at all ... it was just cheese fries... I don't have a photo but literally we were served fries with just cheese. Not bad tasting but not what was advertised. As for the drinks the green tea shots were good but the vodka cranberry was watered down so much. There was like no vodka and barely any cranberry. The whiskey sours we got tasted hoppy like beer. I understand a bar not having good food but the drinks? The whole point is the drinks haha..As a craft beer lover, I'm usually looking to check out the craft beer scene in the city. Been here a few times with various group sizes at different times of the day. My experience here has been nothing short of a pleasant one. The bartenders are helpful if in need of a recommendation and they have a nice rotating selection of both tap and cans. During the day is more of a nice chill vibe while in the evenings it can be a bit livelier (I dig both).  Haven't tried the food here but friends had, and they've complemented the dishes each time. If you're looking for a nice craft beer to enjoy on the upper west side, then I'd recommend giving this spot a try..Bartenders are great. I really like that we have a place like this on the UWS (with sort of a hip Brooklyn vibe). The beer selection is massive. However, yesterday I ordered a draft beer and was surprised to be charged $14 for it. It was not a fancy import European beer or hipster art beer from a microbrewery, it was just a Maine beer I've gotten for $7-9 for the entire bottle--instead, I got a pint that was a little flat, and not-quite-cold ... for $14. Even for Manhattan, that is way expensive.   Also, the place is starting to feel gritty, like it needs to be cleaned. The bathroom looks a little bit like a crack-den, and everything seems like it has grime on it. It makes me hesitant to actually order food from here.  The tables all need shimmies because they all wobble, the whole place needs a refresh / deep scrubbing..Just a regular beer serving bar. I wouldn't say there's anything special here. Maybe it's a good place to gather with friends if you don't really care about the quality you're getting.What annoyed me was that on their website, instead of having a list of their canned beers, someone was too lazy and just took a picture of the canned beers they had and uploaded it. But those pictures weren't even updated so some of those beers aren't even available.As for the drafts, I just think it could be better, like a better selection. And the food is of course your regular bar food. The lemon pepper wings were pretty good IMO; I had asked for sweet and spicy but got buffalo for my other set of wings so that was disappointing.That's all.Meh. Really wanted to like this local bar. Have tried four times now and they can't seem to get it to work. Food is expensive and quality is poor. Had a burger and honestly couldn't finish it. Meat tasted like it was just a frozen patty microwaved. Understand the paper plate thing but it made it worse. Service isn't great but truly hope they survive as I do know my friend who is a major beer lover thinks their beer selection is the best in the hood! Stay away from the food but enjoy the beer!.I feel like this place is good for drinks , i tried the burger and the cheese balls and I feel like the french fries were the main character of it all , would def come back for the fries and some drinks but that's it.I really thought I was gonna see burly men in beards drinking from kegs and clinking beer mugs in this UWS beer hall. TOTAL opposite! Gerbhard's has an edgy, eclectic and cool crowd. A few steps heading down from street level, entrance on left, then the place comes off three ways: you're in a basement, I just walked into 1981's 'American Werewolf In London' pub and you just stepped back in time to the Middle Ages- all into one. Low ceilings, lots of high tops- plus the Bar area has these funky red lightbulbs bouncing back at their drinking glass rack- I don't know if this is a nostalgia kick for me but I was digging it. Never the beer drinker, hubs though wanted to get his on. I don't know what reigns supreme here in terms of food, but I did a once over at the menu and noticed a few bites I could eat. Menu seems well-rounded with something for carnivores, Pescatarians, Vegans and Vegetarians. Music was an 80s American and British pop mashup with Soft Cell's 'Tainted Love', Blondie, Duran Duran, etc on the playlist. You place food and beer orders at the Bar and then it's brought to you. Bartenders were knowledgeable and well-versed in the beer list when hubs was unsure of a few- plus they also have a beer rundown on the chalkboard.My Vegan Mushroom Tacos with Tofu 'aioli' were delicious plus their ginormous pretzel was warm chewy good. This spot has a nice crowd going- I mean...it was practically filled to capacity. Service was good and honestly I don't mind coming back for the nice menu...while hubs enjoys his beer."
"The food here is pretty good, especially the stew chicken and steak with onions.  The customer service is quite lacking though. As a customer, you are made to feel as if they are doing YOU a favor by taking your order, whether over the phone or in the restaurant itself.  Numerous people have asked WHY is their breakfast not listed on Seamless, and the response was just to order over the phone. Hello? Why not rectify this, and include the breakfast in Seamless? The whole purpose of Seamless is to avoid placing the order over the phone, as they are quite rude over the phone, put you on hold forever, and get the order wrong.There is definitely room for improvement, especially on how they treat their customers..Staff is friendly but the food is horrible. The only meal worth having is coffee and the tres golpes. I've had salmon, sancocho, white rice and steak and they have always disappointed..I order the Cuban sandwich from here on a regular basis, and I think it is fantastic. I have also ordered a spare rib lunch special and that was good. If you are in the mood for a solid Cuban sandwich, I would give this spot a try. They have good prices and the serving size is good as well (sometimes the sandwiches are a little larger then others). I generally order in advance and am able to pop in and out really quick, and I like that..Order delivery from here consistently. Food is always delicious and authentic, also very affordable and the portions are family style. Definitely recommend to anyone craving Dominican food, will not disappoint!.I ordered from this place on DoorDash 3 times and each time they got my order wrong. 1st time I ordered- I order pernil & tostones with WHITE RICE AND RED BEANS. The sent me arroz con grandules. I didn't complain because the  rice was still good even though the pernil was way too oily. 2nd time my husband ordered - he ordered a plantain stuffed with cheese and GROUND BEEF. They sent his plantain stuffed with what seemed like shredded or sliced steak. We let it slide because we thought that's what they meant by ""ground beef"" and, again, the food was good so we didn't complain. 3rd time my husband and I placed an order together - He ordered the plantain stuffed with cheese and GROUND BEEF again (expecting what I just described we got delivered above) with a side of white rice. This time the plantain came stuffed with actual ground beef. I ordered skirt steak. Because they didn't put a description of what comes with the steak; on top of the fact that the skirt steak was in the ""meats"" section of the menu, I assumed it came with no sides - just the steak. So I ordered a second side of rice for myself. Side note: One thing I didn't like was when you click to choose rice, they don't give you any options of different types of rice. So in the special instructions box I specifically wrote I want one white rice and one arroz con grandules (which I wanted because that's what they gave me the first time they screwed up). Not only did I get TWO trays of white rice...I GOT THREE!! Apparently the steak DID come with a side of white rice and beans. Out of ALL THESE ANNOYING MISTAKES, it's like how do you know what to order from this place when every time you place the same order something different is given to you? Is the person controlling the online orders unable to read? Are the cooks not on the same page about the recipe? I just don't understand it. I reached out to door Dash for an immediate refund and they gave me my $45 back plus a $10 credit because of all of this.I'm only giving this place two stars because, like I said, out of all the screw ups the food they did give us was still pretty good. If I ever order from here again I'm going to the store myself and I'm checking my food before I leave..Okay so I called to place an order for a camaronfongo (shrimp mofongo), avocado salad and a papaya shake. Picked it up paid my $23 and left, food smelt great and after all who really can mess up those things? Got home opened my food and the mofongo was HARDD which me being a chef means the mofongo wasn't made FRESH. Shrimp was totally bland even though it was sitting in a garlic sauce and it was also under cooked. Might as well have been RAW. Papaya shake was literally all milk! I'm not one to make bad reviews but this one was neccessary I would never order from them again. I only gave them a try cause mi casa was closed, if you can save your money save your time..I was very disappointed with this place. I ordered for the first time on Grubhub today for pickup at 5pm, and when I went to pick up my food, they told me that they cancelled the order because I never came to pick it up. I showed them that my pickup was supposed to be at 5pm. They acted like they didn't care. I looked at the food that they had ready to serve, but it was not appealing at all. I ended up having to go to another restaurant. I will not order from them again, nor would I recommend them to anyone. It's okay though. Other restaurants would probably appreciate my money more..I love this place. Cheap and good Everytime I order. Haven't been disappointed yet. I've ordered over the phone ir through grubhub and never had a problem. Once my order was running late and they called me ahead of time to let me know which I appreciated. Coming here for drinks on a Friday and Saturday is a must. I love the vibes.Food was good when they first opened. Grabbed dinner tonight for the family. Pernil was 6/10. The chicharron de pollo sin hueso was 7/10. But the salad was sour. Unacceptable for a 50$ dinner..Disclaimer- The length of this review is a reflection of the length of time we spent just waiting.I went here recently and we were able to sit outside which was nice aside from the fact that the J train runs right above making it hard to converse at times. I was a little worried about that at first, but that was the least of our worries.First, when we arrived there was no one there to seat us which meant us standing around awkwardly peeking into the restaurant for several minutes as other diners looked on in amusement. When we finally got a table, it took another 10-15 minutes or so for the waitress to actually come and take our order even though there were only 4 tables total and we were sitting with our menus closed in front of us like good little diners. When the waitress finally took our order, we ordered 2 (maybe 3?) cheese empanadas, a fish sandwich and the octopus with rice and beans. We also ordered a pina colada and strawberry margarita. There was a little confusion about the empanadas because the menu listed an order as 3 but the waitress kept holding up 2 fingers and asking how many.In most restaurants the waitress would come back fairly quickly with the drinks, then the apps soon after then the food. That did not happen. We waited for a good 25 mins as the waitress served other table without a drink or app in sight. Finally she comes back to the table and takes our drink orders again (understandable, 30 minutes is a long time to remember 2 drinks) and she brings them about 5 mins later. Still no apps. So I ask her and she replies that they do not in fact have any empanadas. So kind of her to tell us after 45 mins. I guess they didn't have any other apps either since she never asked us if we'd like something different.Another waitress finally comes in and I think there's hope. But alas, it was another 15-20 minutes before I got my food, the octopus. My boyfriend's food would take an additional 10 minutes. I am a forgiving person and I might have been willing to overlook (some of) the bad service, but most of the octopus was like rubber and completely inedible. The boat load of sauce it came in (a surprise because the menu did not mention it was still swimming) was actually very flavorful and went well with the rice and beans but I was so excited for the ocopus that I was very disappointed. The fish sandwich was oozing with mayo and my boyfriend described it as ""alright"". Through all of this, the waitress never came to our table once to check on us, to ask if we wanted more drinks (the bf just went to a nearby bodega to buy a beer) or to let us know that they did not have the appetizer we wanted. I guess the takeaway is, if you're actually hungry and want food, don't go here.They also took about 20 mins after clearing the table and us asking for the check twice to actually bring it."
"In all the times I get Popeyes chicken from this location this time was the quickies serving time. They hired new employees who really do an amazing job. Kiddos to Monte, who does a great job getting the orders ready he was very cordial,  pleasant and fast. Just a real nice experience..Tried to order from the Popeyes app which gets delivered by door dash. Ordered $60 worth of food and they sent 1 sandwich. The driver called the store and got hung up on   I called the store and was telling her my name and order TO which she said And I quote... DON'T call the store ... and hung up. The driver helped me call door dash WHO were very helpful but because I used the Popeyes app the store had to issue the credit and not door dash. Their rep called the store to talk to the manager Natalie who said we both disrespected her...By calling the store. He told me that and I went ballistic. We have cameras that record everything at the front door that captured the conversation. End result...DON'T GO TO POPEYES...DON'T ORDER FROM POPEYES.Why can these stupid fast food restaurant just be a little fucking professional !! Don't take the order if you have no item available!!! 25 mins delay! And still waiting.   This is bullshitThe the worker there completely full of fking shit!  They won't even tell you how much longer.  Take the fking money and put it on your moms grave!  I'm out of here!! Fuck ! You!!!.Before this has no problem with fast service took less than 3-4 min. After suddenly It's a completely whole different scenerio, the staff and the management got worsen but chicken completely dried and stale can't even eat it..Don't order from this place it mess up orders a lot it not the first time for me this been happening most. Like I don't mind if it a small thing but like come on! I order $50 something and not even half of it came like come on. DONT ORDER HERE OR YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED this is not the first time..I went to Popeyes today to pick up an order and witnessed the most disgusting customer service Ive ever experienced in my life. There was a group of customers waiting outside the restaurant rather than inside due to COVID precautions. No problem, we were all being patient because their chicken is good. A young man was looking in the window, presumably to see if his order was ready, and one of the workers came out and started yelling at him screaming ""don't breathe on the window""The guy was telling her that he was trying to see if his order was ready but she kept screaming and yelling at him. She went up to him and acted like she was going to attack. She ripped up the ticket to his order and threw it. She was literally threatening to PHYSICALLY ASSAULT HIM. I can't believe that he stayed so calm and walked away because I really thought it was going to get physical. Like WTH, I know it's Forest Ave and most of the workers are teenagers, but when customers start getting threatened and approached in a physically violent manner for doing nothing wrong-  ITS UNACCEPTABLE.If I hadn't already paid for my food I would have left. I WILL NEVER return to this Popeyes because if I had been in his position I would have laid that girl TF out and caught a case. TLDR; Chicken is good but jail ain't worth it ‍.Well there was a time back there that I thought I loved Popeye chicken but after continually getting over fried breast to the point of no meat just very over fried skin and bone and mashed potatoes with flavorless gravy and coleslaw that was too sweet I stopped going.....Line taken too long got some lazy people working... one line for order while there plenty people working in back.Christina with the red hair and christina the manager were professional, courteous and patient with me. It was my first time there and I was amazingly thrilled to encounter such professionism in a Popeyes ..The older lady in the front wear brown shirt different from the rest of the crews uniform . Guess she an upper employee here and she is unfriendly and stuck up like she don't give a S@@T of the customers. She shouldn't be on this field of service if she hate her position so much!! The rest of the younger girls are great but they have to go through her for everything to accommodate the customer.People like her need to work somewhere like a warehouse that don't have to deal with customers!Tips: check your order before you leave the place. Missing order here n there!!"
"After the remodeling and the addition of the DD it's starting to look nice. The customer service has changed as well. It's clean at all times too..Some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Their credit card machines didn't work and you couldn't pay with cash and get change back if you didn't need the full amount. You had to guess how  much gas your car would need..Full 24hr service, with food/drink service. Located before entering bronx river pkwy (n/b)"
"one of the best mediterranean food and gr8 service usually busy during lunch hours due to close vicinity to many businesses.The seafood is so fresh here: we went for dinner last night and ordered a bunch of appetizers: blue point oysters, charcoal-grilled garlic shrimp, caepaccio or octopus, halloumi and Chilean sea bass souvlaki. This was more than enough food for two people, especially alongside their house-made bread and hummus.This place was hopping on a Tuesday night and no wonder, given the high quality of food and excellent service. I would highly recommend this restaurant, especially if you're in Midtown..Fine dining Greek restaurant. Amazing cocktails and attentive staff. Good quality food, and good portions.Definitely recommend..Went here for a corporate lunch. Highly recommend the pre fixe menu for lunch for an efficient order and delicious food, since the menu is huge this really scales down the choices so you don't spend too much time. It's good value for 3 courses and I was full. The place is packed during peak lunch time and for good reason,the food is good and service and ambience is great. It's popular for a reason. Great service, they work really hard..Go there for their lunch prix fixe. It's a good deal ~$31 for 3 courses. I really like their grilled calamari and branzino.One of the best outdoor setups in the City!We came here for a team lunch in the middle of the winter, and the outdoor heating kept us warm and cozy. We were also able to sit in the back garden for some privacy and proper social distancing.Prix fixe lunch was a great value - 3 courses for $31, and the fish of the day was tasty and fresh.Slightly lacking is the service. We had to remind the wait staff to refill our water, and the overall attitude didn't come across as friendly..I can't believe I forgot to review this after being taken out to dinner by a vendor.   The weather was still mild when I went and the huge outdoor space was packed!  They even had one large tent like area where a large group was standing and mingling.    My table was inside and there was also a good crowd.We had a party of six and since it was a vendor, they wanted to order lots of stuff.  For starters, we had a delicious beet salad and some amazing grilled octopus along with some terrific and light fried zucchini.  There was some ceviche that was just okay.    For an entree, I had prawns and truffle fries.  Both were very good.   I had molten chocolate cake with fig ice cream for dessert along with a few old fashioneds that were good.Service was exactly what you'd expect at a place in midtown that caters to companies on Park Avenue with expense accounts.  They pushed a lot of food and didn't do anything quickly so we'd drink more and spend more money.   From the time I sat down til the time I left was just over three hours.   If you're there just as regular people eating, you'll probably get out of there more quickly.I enjoyed the food in the atmosphere and I'm glad I wasn't paying because it was very pricey.   I'd happily go back again if someone else was paying even if it means I have to sit trapped in a table for three hours..I've been to Avra 5 or 6 times over the past few years and every time, I love it. Service is always precise and prompt, especially for such a large restaurant. I've mostly sat in the main dining room and really like the energy. It's bustling, but not so loud you have to yell over the person next to you. I usually get the saganaki, the Greek salad, the shrimp cocktail and fish as my main. The zucchini and eggplant chips are also an awesome snack, with really great spices and authentic tzatziki for dipping. You can't go wrong with any of the seafood here. The list of fish you can choose from is extensive; I highly suggest asking for a recommendation from the waiter based on your preference. They make perfect martinis here, and they have a very complimentary wine list. I always look forward to having dinner here and highly recommend as a luxurious dinner or celebratory treat. It's consistent, fresh and delicious..Had a great time with a few family members that were in New York visiting from Virginia Beach. They have two locations in the city and this one which is on East 48 th is the first one. Overall great experience, there were one or two minor things not worth mentioning.  I found the food to be some of the best prepared  Greek food I've had in Manhattan. There is plenty of room and with COVID they have expansive outside dining.  The inside of the restaurant is really well decorated and has a lot of wood and stone work that transports you back to Greece. They have a phenomenal selection of fresh fish that is sold by the pound so you can customize it to share with someone else. They are well staffed and they attention to the customer with one of the managers coming to check in towards the end of the evening. They were nice enough to comp desert because of one of the minor problems I mentioned. It was good to see they didn't just provide lol service and wanted us to be happy.They have a nice wine list, make excellent mixed drinks and did not rush us at all. You need to make a reservation for sure if you are going to dinner as the restaurant had almost every table filled from back to front to outside by 8:30 pm.The restaurant provides complimentary bread with hummus, olives, radishes and kept refilling it. You can get filled up on that alone. They actually brought a bowl of hummus on the refill which I would think most restaurants would usually charge for. They did not.We ordered a 2018 Malbec which was excellent. For appetizers had the Chilean Sea Bass tacos which come three to an order and added one so we could share. We also had the stuffed grilled calamari which were three whole pieces stuffed with cheese and had a great sauce. Again we added a fourth piece to share. For the main course we had the Halibut and the Chilean Sea Bass as it was that good as an appetizer. All the food is great, I don't think you can go wrong. Portions are generous and some can be split. For desert we shared the molten chocolate cake with fig ice cream, another great choice.All in all it was a nice experience, definitely not rushed as we spent three hours there. I would definitely recommend them and will come back in the future..So, I was in the middle of writing this raving review after dinner ""Love love love this restaurant! Their fish is the best. They have a great menu, there's something for everyone. ""When I felt this sudden sharp cramp in my stomach. SURPRISE! I got food poisoning. I was celebrating a friend's anniversary with dinner and ended up in the bathroom through the night. Literally the worst pain I've felt in a long time. It was very disappointing to say the least. One, because of how expensive it was but also, this place was fixing to become one of my favorites! On the bright side, I'm looking slim and trim for my vacation this weekend."
"This location is one of the best diners in the Bronx. Great for catering to bigger groups during graduation and parties. This place has parking and it's in a busy street due to the Wendy's and McDonald's located directly across the street. The staff is friendly and hard working. The food is spot on also catering to Spanish dishes as well. Must try!!.I ordered on line and never got my food. Tried calling and phone number does not work..Stopped in for dinner.Ordered chicken noodle soup and a cheeseburger, medium rare with ""Hennessy Sauce"" and French Fries. The chicken noodle soup had to be home made with all the chicken that was in it. My burger was medium rare liked I asked. The ""Hennessy Sauce"" was delicious. The waiter and bus boy kept filling up my water glass continuously. My Diet Coke was replenished more than once. Good food. Good service. pleasant people. What more do you want in a diner? A Yelper complained about the decor. It's a diner genius. SME New Rochelle.This was my first time here in a while. The first couple of times were actually really good... That being said, WOW, this place is going downhill fast or maybe I just had a bad experience.It all started with the waiter barely understanding what we were ordering. He did not know what an avocado toast is... okay, no biggie. He asked a different waiter and he said that they did not have but they have fresh avocados and they would slice one up and put it in bread. The bread was overly toasted and tasted burnt! The chicken and waffles... is making me nauseous even thinking about it. The more time that went on, the more oil that kept leaking out from the chicken. I asked for my turkey bacon to be well done and it was just as flooded in oil. My coffee tasted sour and days old.We barely touched our food and knew it was time to go. The customer service is also lacking. If you see we just arrived and left without even eating, how about ask your customers if everything was fine.Also, in addition to training your staff, please get new plates... those plates are dirty, old and cracking..I have had my eyes on Riverdale Diner for some time now, and what better day to go than on Christmas day!? Christmas day... old school diner?! Felt like I was living in a Christmas story, LOL.Anyway, I do not know what everyone's negativity toward this place is about but I had a perfect experience here... from the service, to the silverware, to the FOOD, to the drinks, to them never letting my glass of water go empty... Everything was perfect! I would keep wasting your time writing more, but just go and enjoy it yourself!.Ordered the pernil, but it is more like a pork steak. The rice and beans spices is too bland. If you're used to DR and PR restaurants getting your pernil, this is night and day- I suggest choose another in the menu. I'll stick with the regular diner specialty next time..Awesome turnover/flow of business. The staff is equally energetic and pleasant. Food is standard diner fare and always fresh.Simple diner with its decor still trapped in the past, but I guess that added to a level of charm... Abva was very pleasant and provided great service. My matzo ball soup with delicious and warming. Grilled chicken panini with roasted red peppers, mozarella, and pesto was really tasty. Very diverse menu and they serve liquor..I visited this dinner placed my order waited 40 minutes for my for every plate was missing something. The home fries with eggs and bacon was missing the bacon. The shrimp and grits with cheddar cheese was missing the cheese and a cold corn muffin requested extra hot was put on the table extra cold. The manager was nasty to me, I pay full price and left because he was just too sarcastic with me..First of all, in the middle of the pandemic, they are reusing disposable menus. They gave me a disposable paper menu and it was sticky with some sauce on it. I immediately pulled out my hand sanitizer to clean my hands. Once they took my order, that paper menu went straight back to the top of the menu pile. I'd rather have them give me a regular menu so they can sanitize it properly after every customer if they are going to reuse a paper/disposable one!The Huevos Rancheros was not really Huevos Rancheros. It's served in a taco bowl. How hard is it to serve it on regular tortillas? And the refried beans had raw onions in it. The avocado and other garnished veggies were dry and looked like they had been sitting around for a while. And it's topped with cheddar cheese.... I really couldn't eat much of it.My coffee cup had a stain on the inside that wasn't washed off properly. And we are in a pandemic. I give them 2 stars because the service was good. The employees all are wearing masks and they were cool about giving me a new hot cup of coffee when mine completely cooled off. Also it's nice they have patricians between the booths which makes me feel a little more comfortable regarding the virus..This is a great diner with a large menu.  I met here to meet some friends and had a good time.   There are a few veggie options but this is mainly for omnivores."
"The Heights We Still KnowThe slice is big, thick, and doughy with smooth tomato sauce and spots of burnt, taut cheese once-overed with pleasant orange grease. With $2 slices and heroes going for $3.50 to $5, we're in pre-y2k prices. And the furniture probably pre-dates the prices. You'll sit at a greasy table, barely held together, drop some grease on the tiled floor and wonder if you just dirtied the room or cleaned it up. That's as real as it comes. Locals swear by the heroes and burgers too.With places like Rap Pizza and George's down the block, Washington Heights' 181st Street is a pizza den caught in 1985. Opened: Possibly unknownDistinction: The Heights of old.Didn't expect it but, Exclusive Pizza was actually great. The price was very reasonable - I couldn't believe it! There items on the menu are always fresh, tasty and reasonable. Not to mention, the service was amazing and the staff was super welcoming. Exclusive Pizza - A solid winner..Great, neighborhood pizza place. Been coming here 10 years, and am always happy to get a slice..I had just gotten off the subway and was walking to my friend's apartment. As I passed by Exclusive Pizza, I realized I was starving from a long flight (and an even longer train ride... long story), and decided to make a pit stop here for a slice.This place doesn't look like much from the outside... or inside, for that matter. And neither of the workers here struck me as exactly friendly. But they make a really good slice of pizza. You get a good size slice here, and the ratio of cheese and sauce is perfect. It's a thin, but not overly thin, crust, and it tasted great. I'd imagine a full, freshly-made pie would be even better.I'll be back the next time I visit!.What a bunch of lazy restaurant help this place has working for it - I ordered for my mom who is in a assisted living facility in the neighborhood, I ordered her a dinner to be delivered via seamless, the lazy employee wouldn't even get off his but to take it in and to drop it off couldn't speak any language not Spanish not English - don't trust these guys they obviously do not care about customer service or repeat business - Then when I called to complain and get my money back they laughed and said I wasn't their problem Be like me to take your business elsewhere, there are much better pizza places in this hood.Original stromboli had American cheese in it. Nothing original about that.Italian grinder had a ton of mayo on it even though the menu lists all ingredients on the sandwich but doesn't mention mayo.Mozzarella sticks were ok.I know that I'm not living in a foodie part of Manhattan but things should be made right, otherwise specify on menu if you want to put goofy ingredients on the menu item..Pizza was tasted good today. But i ordered Large spinach pizza with extra pepperoni. I got spinach pizza with extra eggplant instead. Poor me but I can't wait the new delivery ... so damn hungry!!!.I used to love this place a lot but today is so ridiculous. Delivery guy shown up at my door and rang a bell liked crazy, gave me a nasty look. Did I need to know he is there since I didn't buzz him it. Im just a few block away from them but my food were messy liked he didn't carry it well.Omellete was not good , pretty sure they forgot to put cheese on my omellete and it was super dry. I was craving from omellete today and so disappointed. Don't  gave costomer that shit look guy!!! They give you a tip that money for your working hard but they deserve a good service too..I ordered from them 2 times since I moved here Delivery on times, Foods are good and big postion. Will order from them again and again..Do NOT waste your money on the garlic bread. I received a burnt  hard loaf of Italian bread with some minced garlic on it. No butter, just a slab of garlic. The ziti is alright... it's not going to make your night but lots of cheese on top. The sauce could use some seasoning..Horrible food received it 35 min longer food was super cold pizza flipped over never ever order from here this food is disgusting.My favorite pizzeria to go whenever I'm around the heights. Pablo the OG holding down the block for past quarter century!!"
"So, service here can be a little sketchy. Very seldomly have we ever seen the same servers so I think the turnover could be high. And they tend to only pay attention to their own people. Coincidentally, I am married to one of those people but anytime I've gone in without him, I can't get anyone to pay attention to me. I will say though, the food is always excellent! There are women in the kitchen preparing the food which I always love. There is just something about female cooks / chefs that I love. Regardless of the inconsistent service, we come back repeatedly. When I come with my Ecuadorian in-laws, they say this food is also very good and authentic. And the value is amazing! My favorite dishes are the Bandera, Fritada and Montenegro..Seriously the worst experience I've ever had at a NYC restaurant. I speak Spanish but the friend I was having lunch with doesn't, the server spoke not a lick of English. When I asked for and explanation in Spanish so I could translate she seemed frazzled and short. The sign outside said BAR and Restaurant, we order two tequilas. They only have beer. HOW ARE YOU A BAR!?We continue to order ONLY because we had already gotten our beers and don't wanna look for another place in the area. The food comes out.TotopesSpaghetti with chickenShrimp ceviche. All GROSS. I LOVE LATÍN food, but this was the blandest most over cooked experience I'd ever had. There was not enough salt or lime in the restaurant flavor this meal. 42$ later I left unhappy and hungry. I hardly had a few bites. Save your money and buy a bag of chips next door..Good Ecuadorian food. The seafood soup was really good. Lots of seafood in there. Good broth. And they have beer! Whoopie!.Maybe because they were so busy, lots of in customers, phone ringing like crazy for out going orders, and from what I saw they even did a catering for someone. But the service was lacking, took 30 minutes for our food to come, mind you my friend order a ceviche? Yes that would normally take 15 minutes tops in any Ecuadorean restaurant. The girls then due to exhaustion were basically not attentive and just MIA. As for the Food... my encebollado mixto was ok, what saved it was the broth. My friends ceviche now..he was so upset. He said if chef boyardee made ceviche, that is how it would taste. Yes it was bland and I never had a ceviche this bland in my life. The salchipapas came with some type of salad, hogging the plate with should be filled with fries and sausage. The drinks were good, had the passion fruit shakes and the Chicha Morada. If I come back here I would like to try other dishes and see."
"Capital Grille never disappoints! Even though it is a chain restaurant, the food is always exceptional. We recently stopped in for NY restaurant week. Of course we couldn't stick to the restaurant week menu. We had the lobster and crab cakes to start which is my favorite! Always fresh and melt in your mouth. My wife had the salmon and I the filet mignon. We both decided to spruce it up and add a lobster tail for $12 each. The lobster was sweet and fresh. The sides available for restaurant week were mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. The mash potatoes were creamy and delish! However, I didn't prefer the creamed spinach but it was ok. We finished up the night with the flourless chocolate espresso cake and the cheesecake. My wife was happy with her chocolate cake and I absolutely love the cheesecake! Now onto the service. Capital Grille seems to pride itself in great service and our waitress was no exception. Shadaisha was an absolute delight. She constantly checked on our table, joked with us, and provided great service without missing a beat! If you have some time, ask the waiter/waitress to show you the bank vault! It's pretty awesome..Had dinner at The Capital Grille on a relatively busy Friday evening and the food was excellent as usual. The French Onion Soup (though it came in a cup and not in a crock as stated in the menu), the Lobster and Crab Cakes and especially the Porcini-Rubbed Bone-In Ribeye were all terrific. The Flourless Chocolate Expresso Cake provided a nice finish to the meal.Taking away one star though in that there was no verification of the vaccination status of the customers, the vaccination requirement was not mentioned at all by the hostess. It made us a little uncomfortable during our meal given the current environment..It was great to be able to dine inside at Capital Grille again.  We had taken out from them since the pandemic began but ventured back in for the first time for dinner on an early Saturday evening.What we noticed immediately was that the tables being used were nicely separated for social distancing. We felt very comfortable eating indoors there, probably more so than any other restaurant that we could think of.As for the food, our favorite steak, the porcini rubbed ribeye with balsamic was as good as ever. The lamb chops were also excellent.The service was also terrific. Brett, who has been our server in past visits also, was again friendly and helpful.Hope to be back soon!.Went back to The Capital Grille - Wall Street on a Saturday evening and it was relatively quiet in the restaurant. Had a burger from the Wagyu and Wine menu and it was terrific. Great burger and great promotion!  Brett our server was also very friendly and helpful.  Will definitely be back..The Delmonico Steak here is arguably among one of the best steaks that I have ever had (and I have been to many steakhouses: Sparks, Palm, Peter Lugers, Morton's, Wolfgang's, Del Frisco's, Ruth's Chris, etc) - the flavor is simply amazing. The Lobster and Crab Cakes Appetizer and the Flourless Chocolate Expresso Cake Dessert were also excellent. What impressed me more in my most recent visit (3/3/2012) though was the service that we received. When my wife commented to the waiter that she was cold, he promptly adjusted the air conditioning. My wife was also having problems with one of her knees and the manager who walks around the restaurant checking on the customers graciously asked if there was anything he could do to help.  After we had left the restaurant, the manager saw through the restaurant windows that my wife was hobbling down the street and he rushed out of the restaurant asking if he could help call us a taxi. Now that is customer service..Went for a quick drink and had a really nice time. Our bartender was great, on top of it all even with the large bar area to cover. The pineapple martini was delicious, as was the vodka dirty martini. And being the fatty I am, the complimentary bread basket and olives they gave were well appreciated! Free Fuji water at the bar, it that matters to you :-).The Ccapital Grille in New York is part of a chain that stretches across the country, but it is nonetheless excellent.Capital Ggrilles strive to find locations that have a bit of history, and this one is in what used to be the Pennsylvania Dutch bank. Downstairs, the bank vault door, which I'm told weighs 2 tons, separates the private dining room from the rest of the restaurant and it's worth seeing. It is easily 3 feet thick, so one can imagine how difficult it must've been to move it. What is not difficult is imagining how good the food is. If you've been to a Capital Grille and like it, you'll like this one. The bartenders have been uniformly friendly and helpful, and the food has been, well, what do you expect of a Capital Grille: well prepared and presented, and carnivore-satisfying. If you're a vegetarian, vegan, or animal rights type, you'll do well to avoid this spot, with its big-horned sheep and other creatures adorning the walls. But if not, stop 8n. You won be disappointed..Great service. Great food. Made my friend's birthday very special! Highly recommend, especially for groups. Also, apparently it was a bank? Idk, but the ambiance is nice. I had salmon, mushrooms, and the mule cocktail (several). Salmon comes with green beans and onions. For an appetizer, I had the wedge salad. Fast and fresh. Highly recommend..We came here on a weekday evening. We did not have a reservation (though the place was not especially busy), and they put us in the bar area at a high top table. We were next to a table who was standing between our table and theirs conversing loudly with the staff. We eventually decided that, given that we had come here specifically to have a relaxing, quiet meal and the hefty price tag, it was reasonable to ask to move. We were moved to a much nicer regular table by a window. My caesar salad was very tasty. My partner's NY strip was good, but not great. The lobster mac and cheese was alright. I liked the virgin mojito they made for me and I appreciated that they did that. Overall, it was a fine evening, and we appreciated their accommodation, but I'm not sure it was what we expected from Cap Grille..Fantastic service and excellent food. Highest recommendation. I had the Porcini, simply put it's a steak lover's heaven..My boyfriend surprised me for our Christmas date here so I had no expectations going in. It was really a great experience from start to finish. To start, Christopher, our waiter, was definitely a big part of the five star experience. He was so nice, attentive, funny, and knowledgeable of the menu. We both started with a cup of french onion soup which was rich and delicious. I got the porcini crusted ribeye and my boyfriend got the Kona crusted NY strip -- both were absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection! My meat was so tender I practically didn't need a knife. The sides were also really good -- mashed potatoes and lobster Mac. We even got risotto that isn't on the sides menu because our waiter asked the chef which was great! Prices were what you'd expect for a top rated steakhouse in NYC. Overall, it was a great dinner experience for a special occasion and we will definitely be back!.This is the best fine dining experience we have ever had. We came on a Saturday for our anniversary. The service and food was impeccable!! They set up our table with little hearts which we thought was so cool. Our waiter Johnathan was a trainee and we would of never known if he didn't tell us. Johnathan was so kind and knowledgeable about the food and wine selection. He also told us some great history about the restaurant that we didn't know which we thought was so awesome. Ultimately we had such a wonderful time and we truly enjoyed our anniversary dinner..I had a reservation for a party of 4 in celebration of my birthday wth friends. I've eaten at capital grille before at a different location and even though it's a steakhouse and I'm meat free I wanted to make sure the meat lovers had a great time. I settled for the crab cakes and salmon and everyone else had the filet mignon, Brussels sprout , mashed potatoes and lamb Ashley was our server and she was excellent. She kept the drinks rolling in and made sure we were all good . My guests all had a wonderful time and enjoyed their food . Service was excellent , pricey but worth every penny. Loved it ! Second time around and I've been pleased with the service and happy that I shared  the experience  with friends"
"Lilia is amazing! The food is outstanding, atmosphere is wonderful, and the staff is great. Steven went so far out of his way to make sure we had a great time and felt comfortable. Highly recommend! Thank you Steven.Lilia, being one of those hyped NY restaurants, had been on my hit-list for a very long time. After ~several~ failed attempts to make a reservation, I was able to get a spot for a Saturday evening. Usually reservations are only available like a month out, since this place has such high demand, so plan accordingly if you want to try it. The restaurant itself is very cute, spacious, and bright. It had a nice lively ambiance with a predominantly younger crowd. We had a very kind and attentive waitress who took our order right away and was helpful with recommending what wine to order. We shared: Housemade Mozzarella: very good appetizer. Super fresh and mild mozzarella that was enhanced by the flavor of lemon zest and paired really nicely with the toasted garlic bread. Really nice, and subtle umami undertones from the bottarga. Would recommend. Little Gem: your traditional little gem salad. Very fresh and crispy lettuce, good italian dressing, and nice amounts of pecorino and crunchy breadcrumbs. Not super filling and pricey so you can probably skip. Mafaldini: Nice shape and texture but a bit underwhelming in flavor. I mostly only tasted very mild hints of parmesan and a little bit of the pink peppercorn. Definitely a very aesthetic dish and cooked nicely al dente so worth ordering if you want to try it. The pasta is clearly high quality and very fresh! Ricotta Gnocchi: usually I am not a fan of pesto but this one was very nicely flavored and not too overpowering in the dish. It was not oily at all (which is one of my pet peeves) and it was enhanced by generous bits of pistachio that gave it a little bit of sweetness/nuttiness. Could have used a little bit more sauce since the gnocchi was a bit dry but I was a big fan of the subtle ricotta flavor in the gnocchi!Sheeps Milk Cheese Filled Agnolotti: This was my favorite dish and what I would argue is definitely worth the hype surrounding this place. Order this if you come here, you will not regret it! Very creamy sheep's milk cheese inside these satisfyingly shaped pasta pillows. The sun-dried tomatoes give it a bit of sweet acidity that balances the cheese well and the very subtle honey flavor/texture goes makes you feel like this dish dissolves in your mouth. The saffron gave it a nice color and flavor too. A highlight!The Italian Job: finally, dessert! This was a work of art. The combination of vanilla gelato, honey, and olive oil is truly divine and you will not know until you try it. It had fennel pollen which gave it a unique herb flavor as well as bits of sea salt (even my friend who is not a fan of sweet/salty desserts loved this.) The gelato has a consistency closer to soft serve but it is still amazing. Overall, I had a pretty good experience here. It is very pricey and some dishes probably do not live up to the hype -- you can get great italian food anywhere in the city so it might not be really worth it to go out of your way if you have easier options. However, if you are able to get a reservation or are a dedicated foodie and want to experience this place, you will find very exceptional, attentive service (5/5 stars in that regard), a nice ambiance, and some pretty good/aesthetic dishes!.Considering that the location used to be an old auto body shop, this restaurant runs like a well oiled machine with impeccable service and an impressive open kitchen. My boyfriend and I had a reservation for Friday night prime time dinner and every seat was filled. I highly recommend having a reservation to come here and live the dining experience that is Lilia. We had the grilled clams, cacio e pepe fritelle, whole artichoke, cured sardines, rigatoni diavola, sheeps milk cheese filled agnolotti, and olive oil cake. Everything came out perfectly timed as we finished the previous dish with attention to detail and presentation. The food was of high quality, full of flavor and freshness and most importantly, absolutely delicious. My favorites were the grilled clams, cured sardines, and the sheeps milk cheese pasta. The olive oil cake was also delicious with the perfect balance of moisture, sweetness, and cream. Overall Lilia fits well amongst the high ranks of Italian restaurants in NYC. It was easy to commute to via train and they even have another sister restaurant in Brooklyn. I highly recommend this place and cannot wait to come back again..4.5 because although the food is awesome and honestly a pretty great price point for nyc, i think it's way too hard to get intocame to lilia ~4 years ago and sat at the bar after waiting 3 hours. was so good i had to come again. came this time with a group of 3 and seated at a table, really nice service, cocktails are nothing too special though (go for wine!)leek focaccia - delish, butter could have more onion flavor but the bread alone is spectacularartichoke - it was better 4 years ago imo, but still really delicious.pesto ricotta gnocchi - nice, fluffy, great pesto, wonderful texturelamb parpadelle - great, solid red sauce pasta. super balancedagnolotti - fire!!! sweet + salty, creamychocolate/hazelnut gelato - honestly insane???? salty??? crunchy???? bitter from the coffee?? a bit rich but so goodolive oil cake - very good, but i make a better one now after i had this 4 years ago and went home and obsessively baked this into existencewith 3 cocktails + the food + the tip = $230not cheap by any means, but not bad at all for 3 people, drinks, and NYC. overall: just great, tasty food in a nice dining room.If you're lucky enough to get an reservation here, please come hungry so you can order so many things. Lilia was so delicious with simple fresh ingredients. We ordered rhe mozzarella with lemon on toasted bread, agnolotti, mortadella tortelli, lamb sausage with fettuccine, and vanilla gelato.The pastas are super fresh and made daily in house. Every pasta was like a flavor bomb and our minds were blown from all the different flavors. Our favorite was the crunchy bread with fresh warm mozzarella. The agnolotti was finished with honey... and I was shocked on how the flavor just mesh so well with the creamy sheep's milk ricotta.. I think I'm still dreaming and drooling!!! The mortadella tortelli was sooooo good. The lamb sausage ragu was coated all over the fettuccine and I wanted to lick the bowl!!! Our gelato was smoothly and creamy, we get to choose which toppings we wanted. We were a little greedy and chose all toppings!! We love the simplicity of Lilia and how they approach their dishes with great ingredients! We loved the service, our waiters were super attentive, friendly, and amazing!! Next, we need to try Misi!!.I have been waiting so long to try Lilia ever since we went to Misi.service - 5/5, our waitress was very friendly and attentive.food - 4/5, we ordered cacio e pepe frittelle (5/5), roasted leek focaccia (10/5, the best focaccia I have ever had in my life), grilled clams (1/5, you can skip this, clams were extremely chewy and dry, not much flavors), grilled prawns (2/5, I can tell that these were frozen and texture was very mushy), sheeps milk cheese filled agnolotti (10/5, it's a must! so delicious, it actually reminded me of home made ravioli we had in Capri), and Rigatoni Diavola (1/5, not sure why this dish is famous, very blend and lacking flavors). drinks - 2/5, we ordered a bottle of Rarefratte Vespaiolo as our waitress recommended and it paired really well with all of our dishes. loved it! but we did not like their cocktails.. (you can skip ordering bianco bianco - tasted very watered down, vesper - really average)ambience - 4/5I would definitely come back for roasted leek focaccia and sheeps milk cheese filled agnolotti! enjoy!.Visited on Thursday afternoon. We couldn't get the reservation for a long time. I saw an available spot randomly. They do take walk ins. If you want to go as a walkin, i would recommend to go on a weekday at 4-5pm, before they open. They get packed really fast.Lilia is a very nice Italian restaurant. Interior isnt too much. Open kitchen and bar. Many wine and liquor selections. Food:Grilled clamps: various flavors with breadcrumps on top. I highly recommend this. No clam fishy smell. Very well grilled. One of my favorite seafood I had in NYC.Malfadini: very sharp, richy flavor with parmasean sauce. Noodle was pretty chewy but easy to consume. Absolutely fabulous taste.Grilled bass: very well cooked. No smell. Uniformly cooked. Very soft. All the flavors work together to create perfect taste. Give this one a try. I loved it!Overall, very recommended. I would like to come back to try more dishes..After learning reservations are extremely hard to get, I knew I had to come! I had no luck with their online system, so I decided to call one day and luckily they picked up and I was able to make a reservation!Malfadini - their specialty! The pasta is long and noodle like, and texture of the pasta was perfectly al denté. We ate the Liang Pi noodles from Xi'an Famous Foods a few hours prior to this, so it felt like we were eating Italian Liang Pi lol. It's not too saucy, the flavor is light. Very unique!Roasted Leek Focaccia with green garlic butter - this will be the best focaccia with garlic butter experience you'll ever have! Trust. The bread is perfectly warm and so fresh, and the butter is so spreadable and every bite is delectable. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Literally every table in our row ordered this!.I really love the vibe of this place. Buzzy and lively yet the diners weren't sitting on top of each other. Cozy, dim lighting with the tea candles illuminating the table.I was here for one thing and one thing only - the spaghetti with pine nuts, lemon, and parmigiano reggiano. I remember having it some time in 2019, and it was just as good as I remembered. So damn good. The spaghetti itself was cooked perfectly, and the silky sauce coated each strand. And because I shouldn't leave the place having eaten just the spaghetti, my friend and I tried the little gem salad and the scallops. Salad was a nice prelude. Scallops were delicious. It came with a nutty yogurt sauce. They were good separately - but together a bit much. But still enjoyable. Topped everything off with a clean Gruner Veltliner from Alto Adige. Will be camping on Resy at 9:59 am so I can score another res. So worth it!.I went to celebrate my birthday. It was the best decision of local walking distance restaurants.  The ambiance, food is AMAZING,service, staff and bartender was top notch.I will be going back again."
"Neighborhood staple. Jessi's has been around forever and the prices and quality never change. Best breakfast burritos! Cheap, fresh and delicious.Thanks for being consistent.The service was fantastic here. Very friendly and accommodating. I am a vegetarian and swapping the meat for potatoes was not judged here. The coffee is so smooth and flavorful. It is not overwhelming at all. I got a caramel iced latte with oatmilk. Perfectly sweet and definitely will be coming back for that and to try a hazelnut next. We ordered the normal burrito but added egg and potatoes and omitted the meat. Very good sized, we both only got through half. My fiancé got the banana nut smoothie. It reminded me of my childhood eating banana peanut butter sandwiches. Very balanced flavor and nothing was over powering the other..Love these little hole in the wall nooks.Terrific little coffee shop with a variety of hot and cold items on the menu board. They also offer a bunch of breakfast options. Service with a smile, along with a great iced coffee for only $2! The small is $2 which is pretty much a normal size and large is $3. Can't beat that deal!.The staff here is SO friendly and the turkey bacon breakfast burrito is great. They have a lot of sandwich options and pastries which I'll be back for. Really happy to have this place in the neighborhood..I usually come to this shop for their turkey bacon breakfast burrito, which is A1. But this time I got their steak torta. Mind blown. This is the best torta that I have had in Brooklyn by far. They have their own home made green hot sauce and the torta has Oaxaca cheese (my favorite kind if cheese). To add on top, the customer service here is immaculate (not like bagel place across the street) and very affordable prices. I have not had one bad experience here and I have been coming here for over a year now. And they stayed open during a snow storm!!.Hold on - I haven't reviewed Jessi's yet? It seems wrong that I'm slipping in and out of Duke-dom for this property and haven't even reviewed it, especially when I love it so much. Jessi's has an expansive menu for all hours of the day, but their real expertise, and my real passion, is breakfast. Breakfast sandwiches, breakfast burritos, all manner of bagels, pastries, coffees, teas, smoothies, you name it, Jessi's got it for you in under five minutes. And it's right outside the L stop, so you'll hardly miss a beat on your morning commute.For some, it's the special breakfast sandwiches - avocado on whatever you want! That's all well and good, but for me, it's the breakfast burrito. Simple, wholesome ingredients, well-prepared and generously-portioned, all for a very fair price. If Jessi's is anywhere along your trip, and you've got a few dollars in cash (no cards here!), do yourself a favor and stop in..Finally found breakfast tacos just like in Houston, Texas. They are delicious and this coffee shop has so much variety with food and drinks. If you want breakfast in the East Williamsburg area, please stop by at Jessi's. It's worth it!!.This looks like a bodega coffee shop, but wow does it deliver. It's cash only, but the women behind the counter every morning make it worth stopping by an ATM. The coffee is great, the food menu is huge, and the experience puts a smile on my face. The definition of a welcoming neighborhood spot..Tons of options and very affordable, however their iced coffee is not good-has no flavor and tastes very watery. Great service though.Love their honest prices chorizo egg cheese sandwich, $2 large coffees and Mexican food lunch/dinner menu Carnitas torta with jalapeños was great just now"
"This store is the breakfast plug. They have breakfast up until 1:30pm. The prices are really reasonable. I can get homefries, eggs, meat, juice and butter bread for only 5 bucks. The ladies and gentleman that work there are friendly, the food is great. They made a mistake one time but I'll forgive them lol. It gets so crowded so I understand. So on the crowded part. On the weekends around 10-12:30 it gets really crowded!They also serve cakes, although I haven't tried, Their cakes yet.A fairly small and modest bakery, they offer homemade good quality breakfast platters and donuts too. $10 minimum if using credit or debit..Small spot on 149th streetWill walk by it if you are not looking for it Been here twice for the Cuban sandwichesFresh pernilFresh toasted breadLarge piece for only $5Service is good Ladies behind the counter are always nice and quick to serve.They're closed and have been for almost a month. The sign says it's closed due to structural damage. I miss the coffee & bread every morning..Coffee is the best, bread is fresh, cuban sandwich is yummy, the only downside is the long lines early in the morning. I always go to one particular lady with black hair she makes my coffee just right..Simple, but good! This was the first place I was taken when we landed in NY to grab some lunch. It closed in the middle of our trip for remodeling, so hopefully they've expanded their grill.Their sandwiches are simple, but delicious! We came by each day until the rehab. My girlfriend would order breakfast, but I was more than happy to have another hot sandwich instead. The ham and cheese was my favorite. The Cuban was ok, but being from Florida, I've had better. Theirs was a bit dry. I also enjoyed the salami and cheese. When you go in, the line is typically long. If you want just coffee or pastries, it's quicker to order. Everyone waited for the grill. I really hope they expanded it because it was tiny! There must have been 4 or 5 people trying to work around it. I don't know how they did it!A great local place. Stop in and give it a shot!.Sometimes the coffee here is so good, strong with boiled milk, today it was blah. But, the toasted corn muffin never disappoints.Breakfast is super yummy and affordable. You pretty much get a bang for your buck!! The girls are soo very friendly and have great service!! They have these little beef pastries that are to die for!! I have to get those in the morning because they go pretty fast!.My husband and I fly back home just to eat in our favorite spot. This is a very special place for me since it's the first plsvr he took me out on a breakfast date. The food is great and the coffee makes my day..I went back to get a Cuban sandwich. They keep these pre-made sandwiches in a refrigerator. I think anyone who's ever made a sandwich before knows that bread that's been put in the fridge will not have the same chewiness and texture as a freshly baked loaf, if only because the cold and humidity from the fridge changes the bread's consistency. Because of this I ask to have the bread for my sandwich replaced with a fresh loaf, which is readily and plenty abundant, and that I was more than willing to pay the for the added cost and inconvenience. I was told that I could not have it the way that I wanted because the owner does not allow it. I was dumbfounded by this response, so much so that I just had to ask if it was the owner that was going to eat it or me. I didn't think my request to be unreasonable, especially considering i was willing to pay whatever the cost would've been, but the attendant was adamant that it was 'forbidden' by the owner. Jeeez, it's almost like they go out of their way to piss off their customers when it's so simple to just say 'yes no problem' and make some extra revenue in the process. Like I said before, they wouldn't know good customer service if it stared them in the face..I went back to get a Cuban sandwich. They keep these pre-made sandwiches in a refrigerator.

You would think that the opposite would be true, but that's clearly indicative of an establishment that doesn't fully understand the meaning of good customer service..They take forever when it's busy, even when it's only moderately busy because the folks behind the counter are constantly yapping away. More working, less talking please!.Great for breakfast, NY-style deli coffee, and natural juices. They might take a while, but its worth it -- and highly affordable.Oh, and steer clear of their pastries. Only God knows how long they've been there for..I absolutely love this place. I'm 40 now and have been coming to this bakery since way before their remodel. Since the 80's and the food is still gods and fresh. Only thing I would change is that they accepted cards. Love love love this place."
"They're an easy Four Stars once you eat their cookies! Make My Cake has the best selection of cakes that you can purchase by the slice. The price keeps going up but it's definitely worth it. I have to get mine too take home.  My daughter gets hers to go too. It's a rare treat I'm sad to say. I love the cookies the best because I can eat the cookie on the way home. The bag was so cute I saved it!! We have a location closer to home. I definitely stop in for something special no matter which location I'm near. Customer Service is always tops! Support your local small businesses......Make My CakeII is a great bakery with delicious goodies I ordered 3 Red Velvet Cupcake, 1 Chocolate Butter Cupcake 2 Chocolate Cupcake and a Peach Cobbler, everything was delicious. I'm thankful they are on Grubhub although delivery took long no fault of the bakery everything was fresh and packaged well..The coffee is absolutely amazing, the staff is professional and courteous. I will definitely recommend all My coffee lovers giving this place a try..I tried the lemon cupcake, yellow cake with chocolate icing and cake with strawberry filling. All were excellent and I will try to stop here to try a different slice whenever I am in Harlem!!.Happy to visit this location over the years! Service was quick and pleasant! Cakes and cupcakes are out of this world! Love the new location. Pricing is awesome no complaint! Looking forward to my birthday cake from here :)!!!! I got the chocolate in chocolate cupcake slice delicious.I purchased a banana pudding parfait today and it was delicious, but as I started to get  towards the end of the dessert I discovered that I had eatten plastic. I am truly disappointed and disgusted.  I have been purchasing from this bakery  for years and I have never experienced this. I guess it is time to find another bakery..It's very dangerous that this bakery delivers slice of cake to my house. They always deliver quickly. Make sure to order earlier in the day as they stop delivery by the evening and run out of flavors. I recommend the lemon cake. I've also had the strawberry cake, but that one was a little too sweet for me (and I like sweet). This is definitely the best cake place in the area..They keep it safe in the store. No sitting inside. You must wear a mask and only a few people inside at one time. More importantly, they make the best cinnamon roll in the world. And the cakes are heavenly. Perfect to make a birthday special. Moist, tasty, not too sweet. If you know you need a cake, order ahead. Or you risk hoping they have some cakes in the afternoon. Excellent muffins and cupcakes, too. I have to stop myself from coming more than once per week. Now known as Ma Smith..Went to location during business hours and it was closed. Actually went to both locations during business hours and they were both closed. Unsure if business is still open..I ordered a birthday cake for my daughter's 16th Birthday. I asked for a simple vanilla cake with white buttercream frosting, some pastel colored flowers, and chocolate inscription. Nothing complicated. I would have given 5 stars if the review was based on the staff who was friendly, attentive, and professional. Unfortunately, the cake itself was a disaster. First of all, it looked nothing like what I had ordered. The frosting was fondant and not buttercream, the background was purple and not white, and the inscription was not chocolate but pink. I would not have complained about that, had the cake itself been a success. The fondant on the cake was melted, the cake had collapsed on one side, the tiers had separated. It was a disappointing mess. I called the bakery immediately and the woman who answered the phone was apologetic and said that the cake was probably too hot when they put the frosting on and that should not have happened. She said she would let her manager know and refund my money. I'm waiting for the refund. In the meantime, two of my guests had to run over to Whole Foods and get a last minute cake."
"Delicious! The cupcakes here are my dream cupcakes. Super delicious cake and dense, fudgy frosting. Will definitely be my dessert go-to from now on..Okay Yelp fam, it's officially been one week since I discovered Make My Cake up the street from me, and I have eaten more than a months worth of cupcakes and cake in the days since. My name is Rebecca and I so AM a sugar addict! It's an honest godsend they don't open until 11 am as that's the only thing stopping me from cake for breakfast lunch AND dinner at this point.Now that I've tried nearly all her fantastic flavors, I have come to report back on my favorites for you.MUST GET SLICES (and get a slice for your fam because you will NOT want to share)+ double chocolate cake (this tastes just like the cake in the movie Matilda looks) and is my kryptonite +  Peach Cobbler is DIVINE  + really love the strawberry cupcakes     made with buttercream frosting w fresh strawberries mixed in- you can really taste it!   + key lime pie is SO SO SO good and really rivals those I've eaten on the Florida Keys!!! OH lastly forgot the white chocolate almond cookies- now white chocolate isn't usually my thing but trust me when I say you have to try these and the oatmeal raisin. I'm drooling at the taste memory.Make my Cake Bakehouse gets ""eleven"" out of five stars- is what my partner exclaimed after his first bite of their apple cobbler!We went in an hour before close at 6 pm. They had sold out of the favorites- carrot cake and banana pudding I'm looking at you- so we WILL be going backThe chocolate cake was out of this world. So incredibly delicious- it tasted like the chocolate cake looked in Matilda.It was a generous slice!The sweet potato cheesecake was angelic - light and fluffy but flavorful!We also ordered cupcakes and cookies but the super dense apple cobbler and chocolate cake slice had us fullAlso we got a super cute free tumbler for spending $20! Sweet, we will be back for some coffee and carrot cake!Support this  beautiful Black Owned Business in Harlem.The store on 139 Street is the best. I believe the store owned on 125st and the 96st are ran by a distance relative or adopted child.  The cakes at 125 st and 96st are terrible please stay away. But please go to the original place on 139st ..I brought a few cupcakes and a slice of cake. All of the cupcakes were extremely dry but the slice of cake was moist. I've been to their other locations before and I've never had a problem with the quality so maybe this location just needs more work."
"That Food is good , they service is so fast and great service One off the best Ecuatorian food I try.When I went to visit, the restaurant was hot. It needs stronger fans or an AC system. It took 15 minutes for the waiter to take down our order. They definitely need additional staff to tend to customers.   Food was okay, the guatita's sauce needed a stronger flavor. I tried the hot sauce, not my favorite and not Ecuadorian style..This place has incredible seafood soups and large lunch platters. The lunch platter with chicken cutlet comes with rice, beans and a salad for only $6.They also have nice breakfast sandwiches & fresh juices. M&S is one of the better Ecuadorian choices in the neighborhood.This place has incredible sanchocho seafood soup and large platters. They also have nice breakfast sandwiches. M&S is one of the better Ecuadorian choices in the neighborhood....Huge portions of food always delicious. Great breakfast also. Try the bolon mixto with fried eggs very unique..Truly the best empanadas in NYC! Fried fish is also delicious. Always try to take a pic but it's gone before I can! Super sweet workers as well. No bs here..Very good Ecuadorian food. It's usually really busy on the weekends but it's understandable because the food is delicious. The prices are also very reasonable I definitely recommend this place."
"Ordered online and was pleasantly surprised. Haven't had Chinese food in a long time and was skeptical about ordering after all the horror stories I've heard on the Island. My only issue was that the broccoli was not cooked/steamed to my liking. Other than that the rest of the food was delicious. Thankfully Not too greasy! They even followed up with a phone called to make sure the order was correct which I appreciate. Delivery was quick. Mr. Rice will be my new go-to place for Chinese food while on the north shore..Don't you just love when the BBQ ribs are full of meat and tasty as all heck.  The complementary fried noodles are crunchy and just the right amount of oily flavor.  So we also got sesame chicken which were tender and the broccoli crunchy and fresh..Had a small pork fried rice. Comes with A LOT of pork for the small portion, tastes great, and they whipped it up in about 5 min! Can't say much about their other plates. Would definitely stop by again to try something else..The best chicken wings with pork fried rice and they also have fried plantains in their menu.There is always something missing my husband always orders me a wonton soup it's disgusting when you order and not get what you ordered we called back to complain and the man argued with us... food is not up to part of what we did get and I'm very upset. Never ordering from them ever again worst experience ever.First time going to another Chinese food is difficult, not know what to expect or if it will come out the same as your favorite place. This is one is very similar to my favorite place ""Great China"" on Forest Ave. This one actually takes credit/debit card & it made it very convenient for me to purchase when was in the mood to run out and get cash from the bank. The food we normally get we ordered. It tasted great! The famous dish ""wings & fried rice"" was perfect! their ""beef lo mein"" was also superb! I was shocked I didn't find it on yelp before and passed it so many times & never thought of ordering there. Sucks my old favorite place couldn't delivery to my new home!.To determine a good Chinese take out place, I rate by the following 1. Brown sauce - 12. Hot and sour soup - 13. Fried rice - 44. Fried chicken wings - 4This place can pass just with fried rice and wings because their dishes with brown sauce just wouldn't go anywhere near good.  The shrimp and lobster sauce was ok too..My go to spot near home! Any time I get home late from work I can always rely on them for food. Not too greasy, cheap and fast! What more can you ask for!? :).I don't know what the problem was,went by reviews. The food was awful fried rice was greasy, ribs  were dry looked old and thrown in bag! People actually think you should pay for this nonsense. First and last time ordering from them. Ate a small amount of rice, was sick for two days!!!!!!"
"I liked blue ribbon sushi and Izakaya a lot, but never had the chance to try out blue ribbon brasserie. It turned out to be one of my favorite restaurants around the area! Fried chicken is always good. The skin is thin and crispy and the inside is juicy. They paired it with honey and hot sauce. We also ordered the paella. It's aromatic but not too salty. It tastes very moist, unlike the more traditional Paella but still tasty. The bone marrow is good, a bit hard to eat but definitely a fun dish. The portion is huge for both appetizers and entrees..Came on a weekend night with friends with a reservation. They were able to seat us promptly. The atmosphere was busy but the service was attentive. 1. Mr Green Jeans - Good, strong and delicious!2. Oysters - Pretty standard, good selection and not a terrible price for NYC3. Escargot - 4.6/5. Good and came out hot as it should. No bread though.4. Fried chicken - Easily the most popular dish here. Comes with a few pieces which we took home. The skin is crisp and the meat tender!5. Lamb - A bit more raw than I would like but very flavorful nonetheless.Overall, I would try this place at least once!.Went with some friends during the week for dinner. I specifically had onion soup and the fried chicken. Maybe I just had very high expectations but for me the soup was just ok (and at $19 overpriced) and the chicken was good but not as good as I remembered it from blue ribbon fried chicken. Also, $34 for 3 pieces of fried chicken and mashed potatoes is steep even by SOHO standards. The outdoor seating has heaters though we didn't need - if you dine outdoors you'll be warm long into the autumn months. Service was attentive and friendly..Had a lovely dinner here with an old friend and a new one about a month or so ago. We ordered ceviche for an appetizer.For entrees, I got the salmon, which was excellent with the asparagus and potatoes. My friend got the steak, which was also very good, and her friend had the branzino. We ordered sides of spinach and collard greens as well, plus creme brûlée for dessert. The service was great, and the food was divine..The first time I stopped in was during hurricane ida. New York was closed but the neon sign from Blue Ribbon was still blaring. I sat at the bar to wait for a friend and the bartender immediately asked for my name. We started chatting and the night really continued just like that. All this to say, while the drinks and food are amazing, the service is unmatched. After five minutes you'll feel like this is your neighborhood bar, only presumably much fancier. I knew coming back for the food was a must. I ordered the sweet and spicy catfish while my friend ordered the fried oysters. The catfish was incredibly tender and still had a nice char to it. Adding a bit of the mashed potato, collard greens, and catfish to one bite was clearly how the dish was intended to be enjoyed. Personally, I didn't feel inclined to add any lemon just because the glaze contained plenty of flavor. However, the real star of the show were the friend oysters. Served with an aioli sauce and seasoned with a mystery blend of herbs you'll really be craving more. Every bite has a perfect of moisture to batter and pairs incredibly well with the cider on their beer list. As I type this I'm already planning my next trip, so if you haven't been it's time to go..This place is amazing! They were very accommodating to my party of 3, that turned to 5, then turned to 6. The food was amazing (give me the chicken!!!) and the service was great. Never a dull moment. Coming back again!.THE BEST late night dining in NYC.  We had 12:15 (AM... uggghh) reservations after a concert at a Madison Square Garden.  Great food.  Great cocktails.  Great music.  Great service.  Can't wait until next time!! BTW... fried chicken is killer!  Also... endive/watercress salad is great.  Yummy steak tartare too!.Overall great food and worth trying if you have never been there before.Pros:- Food quality is amazing.  Ordered the fried oysters and bone marrow with oxtail marmalade as appetizers.   Both were perfectly cooked and delicious!!  I love love bone marrow and this was very well done with the oxtail marmalade to pair with toast.Entrees ordered were the paella and fried chicken.  Fried chicken is a must as Blue Ribbon is known for their fried chicken.  There's a reason why they have that reputation - it was perfectly fried, tender and juicy inside and served with a side of honey to drizzle over and also mashed potatoes and gravy.  Paella was also good with fresh seafood and jumbo sized shrimp.  Improvement areas:- ServiceThe server wasn't aware of any restaurant week specials or promotions when asked.  He said he would find out and get back to us and didn't.  He might have forgotten about the inquiry but it made it seem like he didn't want to address the fact that the restaurant didn't participate in restaurant week.Towards the end of the meal was asked multiple times by busser and server to clear dishes from table when we weren't finished eating.  Seemed like they were rushing us out even though there wasn't anyone waiting for tables.  I understand being a Friday night there may be other reservations waiting however it made us feel pretty awkward to be there when they did that.The manager did come by to ask how everything was mid meal, which was nice to see he was doing table touches.Overall I would return for the food with hopes that service can be more personalized and welcoming..So my friends and I were really hungry on a Wednesday night and stumbled across blue ribbon. We were familiar with the park slope location but never been to the soho location. Any who this location closed at 12 we literally got there and 12:02 and was still seated. The loveeee the hostess seen the hunger in our faces lol. We ordered the fried chicken & it was seasoned nicely and fried perfectly. When I tell you perfectly i mean it ( like the Catalog version of perfection) lol. The skirt steak seemed to be a little over cooked from what I saw but my friend still enjoyed it. Oh and how could I forget about the juicy fried oysters as a starter. We topped the meal off with the creme brûlée that I refused to share. I will recommend this place to everyone. Thanks for your hospitality on a rainy Wednesday night!.Best fried chicken in New York! I've been coming to blue Ribbon for so long because I've always loved their oysters and seafood options. Last night I went in because it was my boyfriends birthday and he really wanted their fried chicken. I've never had it before because I stuck to what I knew but boy was I shocked. The honey they add to pour over the chicken adds to the already delicious flavor and the mashed potatoes it comes with is sooo creamy and tasty! the service is always top tier and now I have more of a reason to visit. I want to bring my entire family here just to try their fried chicken! For some reason I did not get a pic of the fried chicken but everything else we ordered was delicious as well!"
"Got 2 huge scoops and both were SO FULL of brownies and cookie dough in every spoonful. This is why I love Ben & Jerry's, there's so much flavor and different bits to munch on with each bite. A very kind and awesome employee helped me today -- I didn't get his name (I picked up my ice cream on 4/1/22 at around 9pm), but he made my experience picking flavors great by letting me know which sizes were available for me to choose from and how many scoops I could get. Seamless experience! I'll definitely be back.Love this place we support Palestine freedom is important great ice cream n company recommend.Why do I have to tell the worker to put gloves on before he scooped ice cream for my kid. Disgusted and I will never go back..3.5 stars.Wide selection of flavors at this location. A few seats available. The place could be cleaner, but I also went late (after dinner). It's not gelato, but still worth a trip, especially for the milk chocolate with peanut butter. Service was efficient..This location is great. They have amazing flavors and the nice thick waffle cones. They had a sale of 3 pints of ice cream for $16. The workers were really friendly and helpful. This place doesn't have gluten or sugar free options. There are a few seats but there is no bathroom..Great selection of ice cream. I had the marshmallow sky flavor. Tasted like it was freshly made! Staff was nice. Will be back..I go here all the time.  Great service. Today is my birthday and they give free ice cream for your birthday. So as thank you I'm leaving a 5 star review..This was the first time I've ever had Ben & Jerry's before. It was a bit overwhelming with all the different flavors to choose from and I decided on the chunky monkey because who doesn't like bananas. It was perfectly sweet and complimented the chocolate peanut cone I got it in. The ice cream had more of a soft serve texture. It was very soft for my liking but nevertheless it tasted really good. My friend got the chocolate dipped cone with butter pecan ice cream and she enjoyed hers as well..Extremely patient and friendly staff, very fast service, funny with children. Lots of flavors, also serving coffee, muffins, brownies, and croissants ..Fast, nice, and delicious. Company also aligns with my values. Milkshake was delicious too!"
"I was on my way to china-town 8th avenue and decided to stop in and check this place out. I looked at the menu and picked the Nachos Con Pollo. The place has about 7 tables and window seats. The counter top at the window is very flimsy. If you lean too hard it might break that's where I sat.The chicken nachos were ok. I mean it wasn't super fantastic or super terrible just ok. It was $8.00 for this plate. They have other items in the menu. Got too up it's game in this neighborhood. They are surrounded by multiple Mexican restaurants with in a block radius. Good luck!!.Great quesadillas BUT TAKES forever to get delivery. Management should work on that and will get more popularity!!.I placed an order through PayPal for delivery. The items get to my apartment and two out of the three items were wrong.  I called the restaurant to ask them to make the correct items and re-deliver. They said it wasn't there fault, it was the computer. When you order a pambaso it says ""chorizo and potato."" Instead of calling me to ask me what I wanted, they just made tacos dorados. They also refused to re-deliver and said I had to go to the restaurant if I wanted to get the food. Went to the restaurant where they continued to be rude and argue with me not taking responsibility for  there mistake with my order. The food wasn't authentic Mexican food. It is Salvadorian, which I don't even like. I ended up canceling my order and will never ever order from them again..Worst restaurant ever they are so lazy they open late and they never have anything ready on time and close early who closes on a Friday night at 930pm plus there is a 25$ minimum for delivery unbelievable with those tactics they will be out of business soon and is such a shame because their food is good.Just walked out of this place, great customer service and probably the best authentic Mexican food I've had in a long time. Def give ita go."
"Good for: late night munchiesBad for: impressing your dateNoise level: surprisingly quietDrink game: beers and margaritasBest dish: crunchy ground beef tacosPro tip: try their spicy hot sauce Listen up: I don't care what you tell me about your street taco fetish with Los Tacos #1. This isn't that. This is gourmet Taco Bell. Get the crunchy ground beef taco with a side of their ""spicy"" hot sauce. Lather it on generously and enjoy. Unlike Taco Bell, you won't be regretting this on the toilet the next day (probably). It's the best tacos of its kind (which is arguably fake Mexican food, but so is Taco Bell ok?). The hot sauce is particularly delicious and they have an even spicier offering if you're up for it!.I went to this place all summer and also throughout Covid when they were letting you take drinks to go.... So I assumed this time around it would be the same. However, the man at the counter with black nail polish was so rude! I told him how I just got out of work and needed two drinks. I needed to take one to go and he was extremely rude about it saying no and then before I could answer ... he snatched my two drinks and said ""I'll give you your money back."" I never felt so uncomfortable and I was actually happy to leave !!!! I'll never go back here again!!!!! Rude staff and I rather spend my money on the Spanish restaurant around the corner..Great cheap taco place in the lower east side. Quick service for a great bite after the bars..I give two stars because the frozen margarita that I got was GREAT, however the food itself is HORRIBLE. I ordered one chicken crunchy taco, along with a Carne Asada ""street taco."" The street taco was nowhere near a real Mexican taco, but more of a Kraft out the box type of taste. The Carne Asada was dry and unflavored, i'm truly disappointed. I would only stop by for the drinks. The food is also too pricey for such a non-traditional, dry and unflavored taste to it. Will not be back for the food. 0/10.Need to order again to decide if I like this place. Seems promising that they offer there unique tacos. I don't recommend a salad at all the portion was small and not exactly what I was expecting. Delivery was quick and the food was in good condition..I wanted to give a 3.5 out of 5. The Burrito was good but it didn't have much chicken in it. It was lots of rice and beans. It was tasty though. The frozen marg was good..Awesome place for authentic Mexican food. Two tacos were $8.50 and a frozen margarita was an additional $5 during their lunch special. It was the most affordable deal in the neighborhood. The decor has a very quirky latin feel. They have religious murals on the wall and even feature paintings of traditional masked Mexican luchadors and dogs playing poker on the wall.The interior is small so you may feel a little cramped inside. Lots of college aged customers make their way here to pregame during the evening. Best to grab a bite and go. Come during lunchtime for reduced prices..While trying to find a place to eat after wandering downtown, I found This hole in the wall Gem. I was apprehensive when I looked at the menu but me and babe finally decided on the beef tacos , chicken burrito loco, the queso loco pork taco and the margaritas.I thought all of the food tasted delicious. However, I think the queso loco taco as a bit overrated because I didn't notice much of a difference between it and the regular hardshell. Also, the burrito loco could have been a little smothered. I was expecting the gravy to act as a blanket to the burrito but instead, it looked as if it was LIGHTLY sprinkled. Although, The cheese on top saved my taste buds.Though there isn't a happy hour special, the 12oz cocktails had me loose as a goose. I can't wait to go back!!!.The Gringo-Mex enchilada is delicious! It is filled with ground beef smothered with beef chili, onions and cheddar cheese on top. Comes with sour cream too! (I get it on the side)..Great margaritas!! I had the passion fruit, blackberry, and strawberry and all were delicious. The cashier was really nice and cute too :) I'd recommend the crunchy beef tacos and guacamole and chips for a satisfying meal!"
"Carlos and I ventured to Queens last Saturday without much of a plan; hoping to find something interesting to photograph (and I needed to shake off the remains of a hangover). We agreed to rendezvous at the 75th street J train station and allow the streets to lead us from there. We arrived separately, wandered near the station, then decided to stop for lunch at Lane Pizza before venturing too far from the train.The interior was mostly in line with expectations; a glass case of pies, a family of small children, stammering flourescent lights. Carlos noted a small placard reading ""No Concealed Firearms"" which we had assumed to be a given. We each ordered buffalo chicken slices, I added a diet coke with mine, and we settled into a booth. Carlos had just been to Japan via Los Angeles. We talked cities, both foreign and domestic, and bit into our slices.No sooner than I had taken 4 bites, and Carlos had revealed the nuances of Japanese subway etiquette, the front door shattered open and the room exploded in a flurry of shouts and gunfire. ""Oh sh*t,"" I thought to myself, ""Desperadoes."" It was nothing new, but nothing I was in the mood for either.Carlos was just as quick to assess the situation. ""Oh sh*t man, duck,"" he shouted as he flipped over the table and we slipped to the floor.They were tearing through the place, 3 or 4 of them filling the joint with the fury of 7 or 8. The details I can recall from behind that yellowed composite tabletop are vague at best. I'd like to say ski masks, maybe one was a luchador, all wore black from head to toe, pistols and/or rifles in every hand. Their bodies and bullets slid through the dining room, over the counter and into the kitchen like a handful of marbles in a quincunx.They hadn't come for us but we were floating in their wake. I could feel a warm current on my ankle. It was Carlos' blood. He'd taken one in the leg. Breathing heavy, he knew that he'd be fine. But we both knew that Operation: Get The F*ck Out of Here was in peril. The family that had been sitting between us and the door didn't fare quite so well.The Gang was now in the kitchen. Blasts of dough, sauce and blood flew into sight. Sporadic rounds fired into the dining room seemed to announce ""We don't know what you're doing out there but it better not be running."" Sharply punctuated screams filled the air; they may have been shouting orders in Spanish, arguing in Norwegian or finding ecstasy through Babylonian glossolalia. Deciphering wasn't exactly the first item on my agenda.Amidst the clamour, the hair of a trembling figure emerged between the counter and the thrown-ajar doors to the kitchen. It was the pizza cook who had taken our order. His service had been very good; extremely polite, well mannered, pleasant, surely adept at handling the pressure of taking a slew of dinner rush orders. But this was an entirely different brand of pressure.Sure enough: as his bloody, or possibly saucy, arm emerged it was clear he was getting ready to bolt. Without a word Carlos and I knew what we had to do: run first, hope that he jumps, and pray he makes a decent human shield.We sprung toward the door. A mask emerged from the kitchen. The cook jumped and the Desperado responded with a spray of lead. We had barely rose to our feet when we skid across the puddle of blood and marinara below the late family's booth and crashed right back to the floor.Our shield was now bolognese and the Gang was thundering out the kitchen. As I skimmed the wet floor, I couldn't help but notice that a squat figure at the rear of the pack was holding a small item under his left forearm. ""My god,"" I thought, ""the ligneous capsa.""Of course the capsa would be useless to us when they were done transferring ammo from their artillery to our crania. But they paused, as if knowing we might know something they might want to know, before erasing our maps. They cautiously brought their muzzles closer. We stared them down, hoping confidence might be mistaken for invaluable knowledge.Then out nowhere, a thunder of shattering plate glass filled the room, followed immediately by a swarm of comparably armed figures. These ones wore dark grey flannel suits and matching balaclava with no discernible mouth or eye holes. They entered at a distance rendering firepower impractical, instead applying hand to hand combat to thrash their foes and presumably wrest the capsa.Within a few short moments the conflict escaped the confines of Lane Pizza. The anonymous figures spread in every visible direction. Carlos and I allowed our heads to drop to the floor. I had a feeling we hadn't seen the last of them, my hangover was still lingering, and I sort of wished that I had ordered a plain slice too.***Note: some details of my consumer experience at Lane Pizza have been embellished for the sake of illustrating my satisfactory consumer experience..I went to this place 3 different times hopping each time it would be better and it was just terrible each time. They are very cheap when putting the powder on the zeppoles, soup is tasteless. I recently just went to see how much fried calamari comes in a order because i don't want to pay 11$ for a small portion since the other times their food sucked. The guy couldnt even tell me or at least ask someone else who works there so he rudely said idk n walked away. Im not recommended this place to no one n I'll no longer go there. 3rd strike im out.Came in to have lunch with my coworker. I ordered some food and he had some Chinese food. We sat down to eat and maybe about 20 minutes later some worker walked over and complained about my coworker eating Chinese food. He was yelling and rude about it. Why did the worker wait 20 mins after? Is it because we are BLACK. Shaking my head, I'm never coming back!!...Food was covered up nicely when I left w/ it;TO HIDE THE MASSIVE FLAWS!I wanted to believe that this pizzeria was a hole in the wall but as I sat waiting for my order, I noticed how rare they clean their restaurant. The amount of dirt lingering on the nooks and crevices of the floor and counter was too damn high. If your restaurant ain't clean then it must reflect on prep and food.Did you know they don't use gloves? I saw them opening up a beef patty w/ their fingers .. NOT A KNIFE but dirty little finger nails. I hope that customer who ordered it didn't gag at his very first bite b/c I would've.I ordered a pepperoni slice ($2.50) and chicken parm ($7). LOL I just realized they over charged me by a dollar b/c my total was $10.50. Wow. I thought the price was a bit high for this neighborhood. ESPECIALLY this piece of crap place. I like how they wrapped up my food nicely b/c when I opened it up at home.. yup my food was good as burnt! Also, my slice was so oily.. the sparse pepperoni.. the oven dirt adhered on the bottom of slice.. YUP. Thanks for ruining my lunch!!.A pizzeria in Brooklyn. I was here only because I had a workshop in the area and this was the fastest food to get since I only had one hour for lunch. Got a slice of mushroom pizza and garlic knots. It is definitely not the greatest pizza I have tasted. The garlic knots were worst. I didn't even finish the garlic knots and the crust of the pizza. It was hard. For the price it was okay but for the taste it was two thumbs down..Ordered from this place a few times, while the food is decent.  They overcharge you every tin on deliveries.  The last time it was just like $1.00 so I didn't say anything but, this time I ordered hot wings $7.00, French fries $2.00, 2 orders of pepperoni bites $2.00 and a Snapple $1.50.  Total order $13.50, I was charged $16.00 and when I called to inquire they told me they would return $4.00, they never came.  I called back and they hung up on me!  Great way to do business!.So.. 2 slices of pizza and an order of fried calamari =17$It wasn't 17$ when I ordered this the other day. Careful, they like to smooch off your money.mind you their pizza is the worst, tastes cheap and it has gotten people sick in the past. Calamari is good but not $10+ good. Way overpriced for a dingy corner pizza joint. I wish this neighborhood had a 2bros dollar pizza. I could've bought 17 of them and they have a higher quality pizza or I could've went to a fancy restaurant and gotten me a proper 17$ dish..Food is meager at best, lil over priced. last resort i will eat here.Pizza was good and Sicilian pie was on point never had anything else so i going based on pizza sometimes cant order steak at pizza shop or calamari but if you sell it should br onpoint .....Roches and mouse walking along the floor. I would reccomend to stay away the pizza is not even that good it is like they dip each slice in a bowl if grease"
"Simply fantastic pizza!  Costa was our waiter and gave us some recommendations.  A true Italian who really loves food.  We had the margarita pizza and the pepperoni pizza. Seriously, this place was just so delicious!.I wanted Calamari yesterday, so I went there as I live in the neighborhood after shopping.  The Calamari was the WORST ever! No seasoning and no taste and the sauces they provided were just as bad.I had a nice convo with the guy behind the counter - Kostantino, so I'm calling him tomorrow to let him know!I should have taken photos..I was at a friend's recently - we ordered a large Margherita, which I was already a fan of, an endive salad and the Ravioli ai Porcini. I had to come back and write an addendum to my previous review because of the ravioli! It was so good, perfect amount of filling and the sauce was delicious! I always thought of Luzzo's as a pizza place, and I am happy to report that they do the other food very well too. The endive salad salad had shrimp (yum!) and a lemon dressing, a very refreshing start to a great meal.My first tip will be: if you live nearby, place an order for pickup by phone and it will be much faster than ordering it through an app. We placed ours on a Saturday night and it was ready after 15 minutes! It was our first time trying Luzzo's so we decided to go for smaller pizzas to try different flavors. I'll say that their crust is very light and fluffy. The margherita had the perfect balance between cheese and sauce. The veggie pizza was very flavorful and toppings really went well together. Capricciosa was my favorite, as I love meaty pizzas! Luzzo's is definitely on the pricier side but you can taste the high quality ingredients!.Delicious gluten free pizza and great location. I got the Luzzo's BK pizza on gluten free crust and it was amazing. It's fire roasted but not too burnt like some other places, which is nice. I will definitely come back!.Solid za but it definitely didn't exactly live up to the New York pizza hype. We got the diavola and funghi pies and for both of them, the toppings outshined the pizza itself. It's hard to go wrong with spicy salami and mushrooms, and while the crust had some nice burnt crisps, the middle of the pizza lost all integrity and completely collapsed because there wasn't a think enough base which could've used some more crispness too. And at $25 for a Margie pie, it's definitely not the cheapest option. For three people, two was basically the perfect amount..Great pizza and good pasta. The ambiance is inside is cozy and the staff is very friendly. I met the owner, Gennaro, who's a really nice guy fromNaples, Italy. Will certainly be back and I would strongly recommend to stick to the Pizza..Absolutely lovely little restaurant and wonderful wait staff. The restaurant itself is cozy and warm, perfect for a dinner with friends or even date night. Unfortunately, I'd give the food 3 stars.We ordered a few apps and the octopus was really the only memorable dish. The pizza we ordered to split for our main was lackluster. Wouldn't necessarily order again.Maybe we came on an off night? Not sure. But would definitely give them another try since the ambiance and staff were on point..I'm pretty loyal to another pizza place but sometimes you've got to venture out to see what else is other there. Luzzo's and their amazing food is out there! The pizza was perfect in all the ways and my apperol spritz hit the spot during the perfect outdoor summer evening but what really blew me away were the fried artichokes. Best I've ever had outside Italy (I know I know so pretentious) but really so good! I would have taken a photo but I ate it too fast..Great experience here! Great food, wine, service, ambiance. No complaints! Lucky to have this option here..Outstanding pizza place. I'm a super big pizza snob, having lived in Italy for several years on and off and this is now one of my favorite places in NYC. It was a real surprise because I'd never heard of it before! Like all great Italian food, it's all about simple ingredients. The dough was fermented to perfection -- chewy but not overly so, crispy but not burnt -- and clearly only cooked for a minute or two in a wood burning oven at very high temperatures as is authentic.The buffalo mozzarella was also extremely good -- not overly tangy as it can sometimes be and their house olive oil is also really special, flavorful and not too sharp.Everything needed a touch of salt but hey, that's why they put it on the table.My wife and I also got the fritto misto which was excellent and not overly breaded as it is about 90% of the time.Strong recommend."
"Love Sosta. Food is solid, especially the pastas. The pizza is great and the wine pours are generous. Super nice people and just a sweet spot to sit and relax. Seriously worth it..My friends and I were acting foolhardy, I suppose. I mean, well, there were nine of us - nine! - and we were hungry. In Brooklyn. At 9pm on a Friday night. After being laughed at by a couple of places, we walked by a near-empty Sosta.""Screw it, it's empty,"" a pal said, fearing that a noticeable lack of patronage must surely equate to a potential food poisoning. Just then, the drizzle turned to rain, and we decided to go in anyway, trichinosis be damned.We popped in, our party of nine, and were greeted graciously. Simply sparking service. Delicious wine. Yummy bread. You can tell the pizza was made with love (I had the Calabrezze). A bunch of my pals also got pizzas - all raved.Oh, you may want to request they ""go easy"" on the garlic if you get a pasta dish. We had the mushroom and pancetta dish - scrumptious, but garlic overload. Other than that, it was a happy accident..This cute little spot on Atlantic serves up better-than-average pizza. The crust is often excellent, and I watched the guy manning the wood-burning oven hold the pie next to the flame to get that perfect char. Unfortunately, certain ingredients are not always as fresh as they could be.* In particular, the mushrooms they use come out of a can, and it's unmistakable.However, when the pies are good, they are very good. I'm partial to the Calabrese, topped with tomato sauce, fior di latte, sopressata, olives, garlic and chili flakes. Stay away from mushrooms and you'll be just fine.The other dishes tend to be hit or miss. I enjoy the Caesar salad, despite it being the only Caesar I'm aware of that includes balsamic vinegar. The burrata appetizer, while beautifully presented, employs far too much radicchio and the bitterness overwhelms the creamy cheese without enough of the dried figs to balance it out. The pastas are also inconsistent; the rich sauces are often winners, but again, the canned mushrooms are a turn off.All in all, Sosta seems like a spot where ordering correctly is paramount to your enjoyment. As long as you stick to pizza and a salad, I've found it to be A-OK.___________*For freshness and pies of the highest order in the 'hood, try Lucali to the south, and Sottocasa farther east on Atlantic..Romantic brick oven pizza located on Atlantic Ave.  Has a ton of potential, but for a beautiful Saturday night there were only a couple of tables filled.  We came with a $20 groupon and am glad we did as they are way overpriced.  Appetizers average $13, salads come in around $12 and pizza is about $16.  Went right for the pizzas because of the pricing of the starters.  We shared two pies.  Campagnola which was Fior di Latte, Gorgonzola, spinach, mushrooms and olives.  The Gorgonzola added a nice dimension, but everything else fell flat.  Second pie ordered was the Molisano which consisted of tomato sauce, Fior di Latte, Roasted eggplant, zucchini and peppers.  Toppings and pizza slid right off the crust and was a sloppy mess.  Very disappointing.  The Nutella calzone sounded intriguing, but I almost got the impression they would have messed that up too.I honestly don't see them lasting which is a shame because it looks nice, but I wouldn't come back.  Looks aren't everything.  Paulie Gee's in Greenpoint blows Sosta away.  I'd rather wait there and pay about the same..Hmmm not really super impressed by this place.  I came here at about 6:35pm and sat towards the front.  It was not very crowded but seemed like more a wine bar than a pizza joint.  Perhaps I should have stuck with more wine and less food!  The menu was good - a large variety of pizza choices and appetizers/ salads.  I asked the waitress what she suggests and I decided to go with the ""Calabrese"" which had tomato sauce, mozzarella, sopressata, olives & spicy oil.  We each had a glass of wine and did not order any appetizers.  When the pizza came out I must say it looked better than it tasted.  The portion was big but to me it just didn't blow my mind.  The pizza was so difficult to cut that we were brought steak knives and I ended up just using my hands because it was so hard.  The spicy oil was a bit overwhelming I felt like I couldn't taste any of the soppressata which looked more like peperoni to me (hey I'm only half Italian but I know my cold cuts...) and there were literally 3 black olives on the whole pie.  Now I could see if the olives were some sort of fancy or expensive ingredient like truffles but honestly how much could it cost to add a few extra black olives on the pie?No dessert, I was stuffed.  The bill was like $30 plus tip, really?  I mean the pizza was ok but nothing out of this world..Not sure what I was expecting. I'm from Brooklyn, but I've never really understood the whole gourmet pizza craze. In either case, I came to Sosta to celebrate a buddy's birthday. The place is super dark, but cozy. You can see into the kitchen and watch the chefs at work.For two of us, we shared a Lucana pizza (sausage, peppers and mozzarella), a Umbria pizza (mozzarella, pancetta, prosciutto), and an order of the Gamberi (black linguine with shrimp).The pizzas were alright, but nothing special. There was more crust than there needed to be, so it just ended up being filling without too much substance. My buddy also ordered the Umbria without prosciutto, and when they came out with it, they added ham or something similar to it instead. They didn't actually ask if we wanted a replacement meat, so that was a little bit weird.The pasta was pretty good, and came with a reasonable amount of shrimp.Not the best pizza I've ever had, but it was worth coming to at least once..Found this sleek but cozy place via groupon or similar deal, and am glad I did - the wood-oven cooked gourmet pizza is outstanding and so is the salad.  Nice thin crust on the pizza, light on the ingredients but that's perfect for this thin crust pizza. Fresh ingredients and nice dressing made for a very nice salad, and wine selection is pretty good.  The decor is upscale and sleek, but the wood oven and low-key service make this place cozy. But what is up with pizza pricing these days?!  Sosta and a couple other pizza places seem to now be pricing individual pizzas similar to entrees, instead of pizzas.  Without the groupon, this would be more than I would want to spend for two pizzas, 1 salad and some wine.   I'll go back, happily, but only with another coupon in tow..This place really warrants four-stars, not five but the extra star is for its place in the foodie wasteland that is Brooklyn Heights.The 12"" pizzas produced by the wood-burning oven are absolutely delicious -- thin crust, charred at the edges and chewy throughout.  The toppings are of good quality and used appropriately - neither skimpy nor too voluminous to overwhelm the delicious crust. They run from $10-$17 each. The only problem with the pies?  Cut into four slices, they are large enough that three slices is enough for one person.  But they are so good that you'll dive into that fourth slice.  The wines are tasty and reasonable: $7-$12 per glass.  Tuesday's are a great deal with 50% off any bottle.The service is friendly, effective and sincere. They chose a quasi-lounge vibe for the place which is fine.  A 42"" plasma above the bar plays black-and-white films (no sound) which works really well.  One day it's Laurel & Hardy, the next is Felini and then John Wayne in ""Stagecoach"".  I eat here every 10-14 days because the neighborhood desperately needs solid restaurant options beyond all the greasy Asian/sushi take-out joints on Montague.A high-end pizza joint that delivers is a welcome addition.  Fascati is great for that traditional NY slice but here you can order a wonderful pie with burrata, sopresseta, shaved parmesan and arugula.  As for comparisons with Lucali?  The pizzza is on par with Lucali with three signficant advantages:  it's located 1/2 mile closer to Montague than Lucali; there's no line out the door for a table (yet); and they deliver!If you live near Henry & Atlantic I urge you to give Sosta your business -- you are performing a community service that will also leave you stuffed with delicious pizza..Sosta, the Pauly D (Jersey Shore) of pizza spots.Authentic Italian restaurant meets lounge music bar.This place serves a pretty decent old style pizza.  However, my ideal pizza joint is a run-down family shop where the pizza speaks for itself.  4 on food, 2 on atmosphere, and 2 on price.  My bill was $26 for a personal pizza (4 small slices) and a salad to split with my girlfriend.  Not the best deal on the block.....Not quite a 5 star experience, but definitely a great addition to the neighborhood. The only bummer? We wanted to try the burrata pizza, and they didn't have any burrata that night! But we settled on a salad to share (argula and parm) and the Calabrese. The balsamic dressing on the arugula was a little heavy, but still a nice complement to the parm. The Calabrese was just enough to feed the two of us with enough room left for dessert, and the sopressata on the pizza was unusually tasty. I did think it was a litlte funny that they claimed to use a spicy oil as I still had to douse my pieces liberally with red pepper, but it was really good otherwise. Dessert was a little less successful (sad), but not a disaster. Berry sponge cake for me and the bomba for my favorite dinner partner. The white chocolate cover on the bomba was good, as was the sorbet. The berry cake, however, kind of a dud. The berries had a weird gelatin holding them together, and the cake was bland. Definitely a misfire, but not worth losing a star since everything else was good. A little pricey overall, but nice. We'll be back!"
"Urban Monster makes me want to have a baby...so I can dress it up in a superman tee with cape attached to it!!  Imagine a little kid running around in Central Park wearing a superman tee with a cape...and not even on Halloween.  Ah.  Yeah, Urban Monster sells urban clothing for babies and toddlers.  For example, they have mini Che and Beatles t-shirts.  So your baby can walk around in style.  Prices can be a bit high...but the merchandise is just so darn cute."
"I ended up coming in here because the wait at Bocca Lupo was over and hour and was pleasantly surprised. The vegetariana pizza was really tasty, (as good if not better than the one at Savoia - which I LOVE) and so was my little mista salad. My friends both ordered the Orecchiette (broccoli rabe and sausage in white wine, garlic and olive oil) and were raving about how good it was. Service was a little slow and the restaurant was super hot inside, but those things aside I think would eat here again..The owner just isn't paying attention to this place. The night we went, it was with 4 parents and 4 kids. After playing at the new and amazing 'Pier 6 Park' on the waterfront right down Atlantic Ave., we wanted beer. Yippee, Stella Artois on tap. Perfect.  wait .... nope, they have no draft beer. ""But it's on the menu, do you mean it's broken?"" ""No, we just don't have it, only bottled beer"" There are 5 or 6 on the menu but they only have Peroni, Coors Light and another one ""Could I have a Heineken?"" ""Nope, just those three, the owner hasn't brought us any other cause he's busy with the other restaurants he owns"". Hmm. Middle of August, Brooklyn, out of beer?!We ordered mussels which were extremely salty, tiny, and has so little white wine sauce that we figured they ran out of white wine too.2 fried eggplant topped pizzas had very thick undercooked crusts and 4 slices of very poorly handled eggplant that was tough, undercooked, and unpleasant; sauce that was boring and cheese that was just passable. We sent the second one back, which none of us ever do, but eating it would be a waste.To paraphrase a recent comment:, ""in a city and borough full of great pizza, this was no better than Domino's and kinda silly. ""Maybe it was a fill-in cook on this particular Saturday night and maybe all the beer on the menu just ran out at the same time. But, gee whiz, the basic pizza should be better than this. Walk a few blocks in any direction and find some real NY pizza. Don't settle.But anyway. The waitress and the other guy (possibly manager), were great. They tried really hard and they were very apologetic. If you went there for just the lovely staff, that wouldn't be the worst idea..Ordered delivery for a Friday night dinner.  Got the pizza with Salami, very good brick oven pizza.  Also ordered the Linguine with clams and we we're disappointed, few tiny clams and the sauce was less than flavorful and developed.  Also found the prices, $15 each to be quite high for the size of our items..I have never disliked a restaurant enough to post a bad review online, however, I went there last night and it was spectacularly bad!  I did not have the pasta but the pizza was just plain terrible.  In a city full of great pizza a place like this cannot compete.  The pizza had a terrible cracker like crust, slightly bitter sauce and strange cheese which was only partially melted on the top.  It honestly reminded me of the pizza from the frozen section of the supermarket (the kind that come in a three pack).  In fact if you had told me it was frozen supermarket pizza I would not have doubted it.  The service was sloppy, we didn't get bread until after the appetizers were done, and I should add the bread was stale flat bread that seemed like cut up pita.  I will admit the ""tower of portabella"" appetizer was tasty albeit not much of a tower.  Please avoid this place..Had come there few times Great place, Great food, Pizza is very tasty. will come back again and will tell all of my friends, delivery is always on time. Feel sorry for people who had bad experience, if i would be you i would give it another chance."
"Happened to pop into Delicious Bakery recently, and left quite satisfied. I can't believe how they've been able to keep their prices so low - mad respect for doing whatever it takes to not raise rates. The rice rolls I got were $2 each, and were made fresh on the spot. Nice springy texture, and paired nicely with soy sauce at the table. Two crates could probably feed the average person, and one crate makes a nice fulfilling snack.I was a bit sad when Sun Hing Lung Co closed, as that was my go-to rice roll spot. Happy to have found Delicious Bakery, as I am adding this to my rotation of a quick snack or meal on the cheap when I'm in the Chinatown area..Tried their rice rolls couple of times. They would be my alternative option if the rice roll carts are not open. The rice rolls are good but a bit plain. The pork is flavorless also the soy sauce doesn't pair with the rice rolls well.The price is satisfying but the flavor is just ok. Not as fancy as the reviews..We used to stock our freezer with Trader Joe's chicken cilantro wontons until we discovered Delicious Bakery (we used to call it Delicious Huang bakery like it says on the sign!)  How did we discover Delicious?  We were standing in line on Chrystie Street for char siu bbq pork at Wah Fung No. #1 and bought a large container of meat for $12.  Did not want to buy the char siu with rice and cabbage plate, we came for char siu meat.  Then we wandered around the corner, saw the $2 rice rolls sign at Delicious Huang Bakery and thought rice rolls would taste great with the char siu bbq pork.  The cook warms it fresh to order while you're standing there!  The scallion rice rolls were our favorite!  Saw a side freezer filled with frozen dumplings and grabbed a few containers to take home.  These dumplings are huge and a container of around 25 dumplings only cost $8!  Since then we've tried them all - mushroom dumplings, chive and pork, pork and vegetable, shrimp wontons and corn dumplings, but chive and pork are our favorites on those nights when we are too lazy to go out to eat.  We just pan-fry the dumplings till golden brown on the bottom and pour water to steam the tops (like gyoza).  I guess we could be even healthier and just boil them too.  Delicious is a treasured Chinatown secret..We stumbled upon this bakery when walking by because RICE ROLLS! For $2?! Best decision we made was walking straight in and ordering 3 different rice rolls. They were so hot and fresh and delicious. The sauce is perfectly savory and sweet and went with the rice rolls perfectly. You have to check this place out, the piping hot rice rolls hit the spot and warm you up from the inside out!.Delicious indeed! Bustling in the AM with locals grabbing a quick breakfast bite (this is how you know it's authentic), it has a bakery counter with baked good in the front, fresh soy milk for breakfast, and freshly streamed rice crepe from 6am to 7pm! (That is wonderfully early) I was a bit surprised this place wasn't on yelp, but given both owners and patrons this morning don't speak much English - this is definitely an authentic find.I am hesitant to trek into a bakery (GF...), but upon reading the sign for the rice noodle crepe (with my stomach growling and nothing else GF and open in sight), I ventured in and asked about the use of flour (none) in the crepe mix, and then read up in Mandarin ingredients typically used online (rice based), and given the steamer is in its separate area and can only be used for rice noodles - I decided to give it a shot, sans any sauces (and avoided things like pork ribs that has sauce pre-added)The shrimp and lettuce one was devoured very quickly, and I bought two more to go, shrimp and shrimp and chicken. I will definitely bring my own tamari next time - but happy to find a cheap delicious meal in Chinatown since I craaaaaaaaave Chinese food so much after having to become gluten free! $2 for any flavor, $.75 for each additional topping (topping is added very sparingly so I recommended adding a second, or third).Service is quick and efficient - NY no-nonsense AM style. And you will literally wait under 5 min for freshly steamed-to-order rice noodle crepe, barring anyone ahead of you in line..$2 rice rolls crepes....do I need to say more? Those rice roll crepes are silky and have a good texture when you chew on it. My go-to order is spare ribs with cilantro and the dried shrimp. They're a little skimpy with the spare ribs but I get it. they're trying to keep the prices low for everyone. They have many kinds of buns too. But I only come here for the rice roll crepes!!!.Ladies and gents, frankly it doesn't get much better than $2 for a fresh, steamy shrimp rice roll.  That's exactly what I got, exactly what I paid, and a 10 minute walk later back to the hotel and it was still steaming.The shrimp isn't to die for, but you can tell that the rice roll was made by someone who makes hundreds of rice rolls a day and knows that they deliver consistent results.  Consistent enough to keep locals happy and coming back and attract the unsuspecting Cantonese looking for a slice of home in the streets..Mmm the first time I came here, I was with my partner and we were heading to the station in the winter. It was sooo goshdarn cold that when I saw their rice roll sign I immediately wanted to go in for some warm food. I went there again with my partner and we spent about 15 minutes just walking through Chinatown just to find it lol. Their steamed rice rolls are made fresh and piping hot, served in a metal tin for only $2 each. It's nothing fancy and the filling can be pretty skimpy, but the price is unbeatable and perfect for anyone like me that just craves a fresh steamed rice roll. If you want a place with better fillings and more/tastier sauces, Joe's Steamed Rice Rolls at Canal might be your kind of thing. But if you just want a solid, simple rice roll for a great price then this is perfect. (This time, we got a beef rice roll, gobbled it up, and then bought and ate the shrimp one!).They have the best taro puff in Chinatown!!! Highly recommend!I also got the salted egg puff, but it was very sweet and oily. The lotus filing was 90% of the pastry :(.At first I was meh about the shrimp rice roll, but I didn't realize you had to put soy sauce and hot sauce. Totally changed the flavor! I even got a scallion one after. $2 each and so good!!! Scallion was my favorite"
"Nice little bakery, the range is not as great as some other places but the space is clean and there are cute little counter spaces to eat at, and they carry all the staples items.I had an egg tart (2/$1!!) and it was really 5/5 - it had a crispy and layered crust with a lightly sweet, creamy, and pleasantly eggy fillidng (perfect!). Outstanding thing is they keep the majority of their baked goods on closed heated racks instead of at room temp. Will definitely go back to this place again. Perfect dessert to close out some Vietnamese lunch from Cong Ly (just across the street)."
"Fast and friendly service here at Pinkberry. Came on a Saturday evening for this frozen treat and it was better than I remember it. The yogurt itself was just a tad frozen so it made it even better. So many toppings to choose from, choose them all!.walked in Saturday ask the guy with braids at the register a question he looked uninterested. Ask about the flavors he pointed to the wall. his whole demeanor was like why are you here ? what do you want? I said whats the flavors confused. I never benign a pink berry. he says ""they are on the wall"". I said "" you to good to tell me the flavors"" I laugh and leave. The reviews are true the service sucks The 2 girls where in the back chatting about their life very loudly. who is the hiring manager. They all need to be fired. stay away.I got here around 4pm today, there was no body inside but one staff. This is by far the worst customer service ever received! As you approach the entrance there were bags of garbage pressed up against the glass. made me wonder if I really wanted to go in but we did. The store inside had separation panels so it was covid safe. We were greeted by the only staff in there as we walked in. She said hello and how can I help you while looking down at whatever she was doing.  No eye contact at all! We ordered the medium pomegranate and when it was time for toppings her attitude went up a notch. Everytime I asked for another topping she's like ""what else?"". She was not happy to be doing any business. She just wanted us out of there. As we were finishing up about purchase, two kids walked and she openly said ""oh God they don't stop coming"". She was so nasty. Quiet honestly, if you don't like your job she should quit. There are plenty of people who would love to have a job during the pandemic. Her appearance was sloppy and dirty as well. The shirt she was wearing was full of stains. I can't say if the dirt/stain was from working that shift or not but I don't think will go back again..I came here once because it is a little far for me, I wish they had one closer! If you like frozen yogurt you should definitely try Pinkberry I always get the Pomegranate flavor, since I've tried that I never go back to the original. They do have seasonal flavors but I always go back to the pomegranate it's my favorite, has a nice tang to it. Hard to find parking in this location because it is in park slope so maybe have a buddy come with you and one of you stay in the car so you don't need to look for parking. I see that they have the bubble waffle now it's like a Hong Kong egg waffle which I love, never tried it with the frozen yogurt but I'm sure it would be good. I honestly think Pinkberry is better than red mango. I think red mango's frozen yogurt is a little on the sweeter side, and I like my yogurt to have a little tartness to it, but that's just me. Go try it out for yourself!.While the yogurt is good, the customer service is non existent. The entire staff were openly complaining to whom I believe was their manager about the schedule. They had no regard for the customers and just kept carrying on and arguing about the schedule. Not a pleasant experience at all. If my son did not enjoy it so much, I would never go back..""Poor customer service ""     After a beautiful walk at Prospect Park yesterday I went into Pinkberry yesterday for some Yogurt only to experience RUDE RUDE RUDE customer service.I asked for the manager who came out SO SERIOUS and did not even try to provide a better customer service experience. In addition to that he came out wearing an apron that looked as if he was cleaning toilets. VERY DIRTY & unsanitary. This happened 08/17/21 @ 7:00pm.      With plenty of yogurt spots in Park Slope, I will not be going back there. I hope you clean up your act Pinkberry!!!!.I haven't been to pinkberry in years. Always loved the açaí berry.  Best flavor of all.  As for toppings, they have a large variety to choose from cereal, to chocolate, glazed fruits, nuts, and cookies. I like to stick to the basics, so I order almonds, coconut shavings, and dark chocolate pebbles.  They go perfectly together.  You can mix it up but I'm not a fan of the other flavors..First off It's 12:15pm and nobody is here ! Finally a dumpy lady opens the doors with an attitude like we are disturbing her!  The line is long and she's the only employee there! And she's very slow! I will not return here again and I don't recommend it to others!.I love Pinkberry, but it greatly upset me to learn that management is not putting on AC on a 90 degree day. As you can see from my photos, it was 89 degrees inside!!I was eating ice cream to cool down, but the employees and ingredients were sweating. I'm not going to return to this location as I won't support this type of staff treatment. Shame on Pinkberry management..very rude customer service!! no one was there and the ""manager"" was talking to an old employee instead of helping the line had to wait for someone from the back to come attend me. On top of that he was serving the old employee free frozen yogurt."
"This is where I get my cannolis because they fill each pastry with the cannoli filling once you order it. Besides getting the pastry made to order, I don't find many places around here that make it this fresh.On this particular visit, the gelato caught my eyes. I went with the almond coconut milk, green tea and tiramisu. How's the green tea? It tastes like green tea, pretty intense in flavor. It was quite humid out so the gelato was soft, but not in a bad way.How was the tiramisu? It was coffee forward with some cookie bits in it.How was the almond coconut milk? Coconut flavored forward, I didn't get too much of almond or almond extract. This was the lightest of the three in terms of flavor and texture.Overall, it was a good alternative to the rich cannoli that you usually get..Food ok. Service staff friendly but poor service (sloq) despite not being crowded. Brought wrong entre out..I've lived in the neighborhood for about 6 years now, and still never managed to dine here. I had a pizza craving and a seamless pickup offer, so figured why not. Opted for the margherita pie, which was light, crispy, and very yum. Good sauce-to-cheese ratio and always love the added basil.  Will definitely look to swing on by again for a proper sit-down meal - they sometimes have live music and definitely seem to be practicing the social-distancing surface very judiciously. Good stuff!.Ii know restaurants are struggling, so it pains me to write this, but we had the worst experience here last night. A friend who lives in the area recommended it and I had high expectations, especially since we were celebrating my friend's mom's birthday.  Our server may have been new - she struggled with everything: from forgetting to bring us the lemon we asked for, to asking us the same question she just asked us one minute ago, to not knowing what balsamic vinegar looked like, to messing up our order. If she, in fact was training, then it wasn't her fault - someone should have been checking up on her and helping her but it clearly wasn't done. So, first, it took asking three people for it, before we were able to get some lemon for out water. Next, the complimentary bread was stale. Also, this isn't a low-price restaurant, so please don't bring me the olive oil in little plastic take-out containers - it ruins the atmosphere. We ordered a burrata appetizer and three pasta dishes. The appetizer was described as burrata with roasted delicata squash, pistachio, arugula, pomegranate, aged balsamic, crispy prosciutto, focaccia, and the server said it's sufficient for a bite for all three of us before our entrees.  Suddenly, our entrees arrive with a different server, or maybe a busboy, but no appetizer in sight. He tells us that it's coming soon. Who wants to eat an appetizer after your entree?  Plus, it's a birthday dinner - things aren't looking too good. I tell the server that we don't want to eat in reverse order and ask him to just cancel the burrata. What the server should have done here was to take our entrees back, bring us the appetizer when it was ready and remake our entrees.  Instead, he told us that the initial server ordered everything together, as if they were 4 entrees and that's why we're getting it like that. He apologized and said that since it's already being made, he'll bring it out when ready but won't charge us for it. The ravioli with mushrooms dish that two of us ordered was a well-composed plate of food, but it was a little under-seasoned and too small for an entree. It needed at least one more raviolo to be an entree size. The other pasta dish was recommended by the server - rigatoni and meatballs, with pine nuts and raisins. You know the cliche about looking for something with a magnifying glass? I can't even use it here - there were simply no pine nuts and raisins there. The two meatballs were tough, dry and terribly dense, the portion was tiny. Put more pasta on the plate, please - it's the cheapest ingredient, and with a  $23.00 price tag, you should do much better than two hockey pucks on a mini plate. At this point, we started joking where else we were going to go eat after this. Then we finally got our appetizer. Remember the description?  So we did get the arugula, the pomegranate seeds and 3 roasted wheels of squash but pistachio and crispy prosciutto were nowhere to be seen. Focaccia bread looked and tasted more like a pita bread than focaccia and there was almost no balsamic on the plate. I asked for some balsamic vinegar and got another one of those plastic containers, only after our server passed our table with it and first went to a different table to ask the second server whether what she was holding in her hands was in fact balsamic.  I could go on but I'll stop here. When the bill came, they, of course,  forgot to take the burrata off. They did, eventually, but we left the restaurant hungry, unhappy and embarrassed  for bringing someone here for their birthday dinner. I shared my experience with a friend who recommended the place. He said, ""Maybe Gianna, the granddaughter who runs it now, doesn't have her heart in it anymore..."".My friends keep coming back and now I know why. I came a bit earlier from my party so I waited at the bar. When asked which Chardonnay they have I simply was offered a taste. That's a good bartender. And it was a good one. We were seated to our reserved table. After ordering a great, fresh bread and butter placed on our table. Olive oil was already there, in its bottle. We had a real nice variety of different food on our table. Veal, chicken piccata, salmon and different kinds of pizza. We all enjoyed it. I set my eye of their pizza while checking the menu online. I had the Prosciutto and mushrooms. The crust was amazing. Thin, crisp and very tasty on its own. The pizza itself was divine. I tried the Diablo pizza with the fresh prosciutto... also delicious. All parties really enjoyed their food. For reset, which we really shouldn't have, but couldn't resist, we had a variety of  gelatos and with the assistance of the hostess we eliminated the vanilla FB chocolate in favor of more traditional flavors. The pistachio was amazing. I normally don't like pistachio ice cream. This one was the real thing. And the dark cherry where the favorite. Chocolate lava cake was also very tasteful and fresh. Service was great, friendly, attentive and they knew their menu well so they were able to answr a question or two we had. It was Friday evening holiday season and they were packed with big parties tables. As a result, the food did not come together but I two waves to our table. I wouldn't hold it against them.Definitely will come again!.I came here for dinner with some friends and we had a great experience. They have a nice outdoor eating around with the tables far apart and they have hand sanitizer at every table. The service was great and the staff all have masks. The food was impeccable. We ordered an oven baked pizza with half pepperoni and half regular. It was so good and crispy. I absolutely loved it. I highly recommend this place for a nice bite to eat on Vernon Blvd. Please give this Italian restaurant a try. You won't be disappointed!.Best pizza in LIC. Pasta was really good too--top three in all the Italian restaurants I've been to in NYC and Long Island. Can't believe it's a block away from us!.This is the best Italian in Long Island City! I moved here in July and am very happy to have discovered Manducatis Rustica. The staff is extremely friendly and the food is great. Their burrata & rigatoni with meatballs are my favorite. Also the owner Gianna is extremely nice. I definitely recommend coming here and supporting local!.Manducatis is a great Italian spot in Long Island City. It's located on a nice strip on Vernon Blvd that is nice to walk up and down. It's probably the last good spot north on Vernon Blvd. It's unique in that it has a walk in sit down area, a bar area, and a nice fine dining area. Not many places have this but it works very well. You can order many different types of Italian cuisine and let me tell you. It comes out good. The pasta is done al dente. The sauces are great.The octopus is actually better than any Greek spot I have had in Astoria. That says a lot. You should get it every time. The Burrata is to die for. Warm bread and cheese. The mozzarella cheese just gushes when cut..We dropped in for dessert after we had a Vietnamese dinner a block away. I ordered the chocolate lava cake and a cappuccino. They were pretty much deserted. The lady was very friendly. We sat at a table and waited for my cake. I ordered the cappuccino when it arrived. The presentation was lovely. The flavors were good. They center of the cake itself wasn't cooked all the way through so there was no problem real ""lava"". When she dropped of the cappuccino I didn't say anything because it was late and they were closing. I work in the industry. I get it. But. The cappuccino was the worst one I have ver had. LOL. There was no foam at all and it tasted like those international coffees that were popular about 10 years ago. Service was pleasant but the food lacked."
"So good!! We came on a Saturday evening, before the dinner rush. We put ourselves on their yelp waitlist on the way there and our table was ready when we arrived at 5:30pm. The interior reminds me of restaurants in China!We ordered half a peking duck, braised pork belly, fried milk, stir fried string beans and crab & pork soup dumplings to share. Our food came out fast and every dish was so flavorful. Our favorite was the peking duck of course. It comes with your traditional crepes, cucumbers, scallions, hoisin sauce, sugar and weirdly, pineapple cubes. Their braised pork belly was tender but not as flavorful as I expected. The crab & pork soup dumplings weren't bad but we probably wouldn't order again. A lot of people order spicy fish fishes but I'm not a fan so can't attest to that.Their service was great; servers were attentive and everyone checked up on us. Would highly recommend dinner here! Perfect for any occasion..One of the best and authentic Chinese food restaurants in Flushing. I want to give 4.5 stars if Yelp allows. Reducing 0.5 just for the waiting time and longer time to serve food. But if you're not in rush, it's worthy to go. Peking duck is their signature and could take really long time to serve. In fact, it came 30 mins later after our other two dishes were served. But it's so good. The pancake wrapping the sliced duck was also soft and fresh! I wish they offer something like a Peking duck three ways. We also ordered sliced eel and braised beef brisket. Sliced eel with scallion in hot oil was In a slightly sweet flavor. It also has ginger in it. And tastes authentic which reminds me of the actual dishes I got in China. Braised beef brisket was in a slightly spicy flavor. Nothings wrong with it, just love it! Will definitely visit again and try something else..The interior design of the restaurant is as elegant as restaurants in Taiwan and China. Every dish we ordered is delicious. Peking duck is one of the best we have had in NYC. The wraps were so thin and delicate, and they hold up all the pieces you put in very nicely - that's showing the real skills of making. Duck soup is only extra $10 and it came in a very satisfying big bowl. Wish it could be more of the pickle vegetable flavors  instead of just ginger - the soup is rich and hearty - very good regardlessly.  The water spinach with bean curd sauce is exactly how it should be, very high quality taste of the bean curd sauce. Shrimp with vermicelli in garlic sauce were pretty good but okay. Lack of the expected shrimp flavor and could do better. We also ordered two buckets of the Pork soup dumplings. They were pretty good. Overall speaking, it's a place that worth to be back!.I've been wanting to check out Jiang Nan for the longest and I'm so glad I finally got to dine here. Their presentation is absolutely outstanding, from their decor, to their food/drink presentation, to their services. This restaurant by far supersede my usual expectation, as we all felt like they elevated our dining experience to a whole new level.  When we got here around 5:30pm, the restaurant was quite empty but they filled up quickly. With that said, I would highly recommend to make reservation to avoid the wait. Once seated we noticed how nicely decorated the restaurant was and it was reminisce to some of the restaurants that I've visited in China. If you do come here, make sure to start off by ordering their pineapple beer. Their prestation was unexpected and outstanding. Our entire table loved the dry ice. It was definitely a visually nice touch and made our beverage feel fun, giddy and festive. For dinner we ordered their jumbo prawn, battered with salted eggs. Their prawn was huge and fried perfectly. It did not need any dipping sauce and the flavor was just exquisite and fresh. The natural umami flavor from the egg yolk made it taste fantastic, rich and nutty. As for our main fish dish, we ordered the striped bass golden pepper sauce with side dish option. The portion is huge and it filled all of our tummies and more. Overall, the flavor, heat was just incredible and we appreciate all the prep work and steps it took to put this dish together. We loved our fish dish so much that we kept on drinking the broth.Lastly, a huge THANK YOU to Jeremy, the restaurant manager. He was so attentive when we told him it was our friends birthday. He made sure to bring out the cake we got her after we were done with our meal (made sure to clean our table first) and then had someone held a neon sign that said, ""Happy Birthday"" in Chinese and English.Oh and one last thing...if you check in they offer a free drink but please keep in mind it's one per table so considered yourself warned..Delicious Chinese restaurant in Flushing. The interior decor is based off of traditional Chinese style from the Jiang Nan region. My partner and I ordered a multitude of dishes including their Shredded Potatoes, Grilled Instestine, duck and prawns. Everything was flavorful and delicious. If you are looking for a spot with a variation of delicious Chinese dishes ranging from non spicy to spicy, the menu here will satisfy.If you go during the weekend, there is usually a wait but you can join the line through Yelp. Additionally, you can get a free fruit tea if you check in on the app. Overall, 4.5/5.During the pandemic, no other restaurant has enticed me to come to Flushing more than Jiang Nan. Other patrons who enjoy the unique dishes that this semi-fusion Szechuan spot offers will likely share the similar sentiments on its beautiful space and decor and willing to spend money for quality food.  No item ordered from the menu has ever disappointed or appear generic in any way.  Fusion restaurants often fail by offering quantity at the expense of quality and posing as variety.  Jiang Nan doesn't fall into that trap.  Among the most loved dishes, the Boneless Pig Feet in Chili Sauce is my favorite.  The flavor and texture is just fantastic.  Other recommendations include Sliced Beef and XO Tripe in Chili Sauce.  The Peking Duck will hit the spot, but I don't know that it is the most unique.  The Striped Bass and Barramundi are fish dishes I cannot wait to try next time I visit!.The vegetable and Pig Kidney were too salty. Make sure let them know to level the salt. I like the inside decor and the service is good, friendly staff. A lot of options of dishes. Soup is great, Peking duck is great ( I didn't order this time, just had one a other location. So skip today). After all it's a good place to try Jiangnan food, make sure tell the Chef, put less salt..I ordered takeout from JiangNan, and I asked the waitress what she recommended. She said the beef and potatoes dish was very popular, so I opted for that. In addition, I order mapo tofu at every single Chinese restaurant I go to, so I had to get this dish. Beef with Potatoes $25.95- 2/5. This was just not good. The meat and potatoes were not marinated for long enough, so the flavor was very superficial. It was not salty enough and tasted like nothing in the middle. The meat was also overcooked, so the tendon pieces were super duper chewy and hard to swallow. The portions were kind of small. Mapo Tofu $13.95- 4.5/5. This is a tasty, classic mapo tofu. The spice was just right, the tofu was good quality, and the minced meat was delicious and not overly meaty tasting. I really liked this mapo tofu, AND the portions were big. Overall: Food was 3/5 average, but the service was a 5/5. All the waitresses and waiters were receptive and enthusiastic..I came here with my parents and sister when they came to visit. I wanted a place that served authentic Chinese food, and this place fit the bill! Caution: menu is huge and overwhelming! So I just had my mom pick what to get. Crab soup dumplings - very standard, but very good!!!For the main course we got the grilled barramundi fish with spicy chonqing style sauce, and the standard side dishes (enoki mushroom, potato, lotus root, and seaweed knots). This was spicy and super super filling and they gave us rice with it (which is 100% needed). Split amongst 4 people, and we still had leftovers! Pretty good price for what you get!.Came here based on all the good Yelp reviews but sad to say we were disappointed. We took our order to go and had the boiled whole fish with peppercorn in hot spicy sauce with tilapia. The packaging was great. Very clean and neat and there was no spilling. The flavor was spicy and numbing just like how it should be. However, the content inside was extremely disappointing. There was hardly any fish! We definitely Did not get the whole fish. All the fish we managed to find had TONS of bones with hardly any meat! Most of the bones were so small and sharp that it was so dangerous to eat. I really cannot believe a restaurant would serve something like this. For $40 dollars, it was highway robbery. We also got the Japanese tofu with mixed seafood and that was very average. For $17 dollars, I would expect a few large shrimps with this dish but instead we got the tiny ones that look like they were from those frozen seafood mix they sell at the Asian markets. Overall, the food gets zero star from me. Service for the take out was good and packaging was nice earned 2 stars. Won't be back."
"I've finally come for dinner and wow, their food is sublime! Brunch to me is good, but not something I have to return for, but their dinner is a yes! Sign me up! I'd like to return ASAP! Service is as always, friendly and attentive. But let's get to the important part...the food!! Croquettes: these are good but I could skip. They're made well and very cheesy, but just not my cup of tea. Braised beef cheeks: holy moly out of this world. The portion is good and the beef is so tender! I was unbelievably happy. I loved the polenta and mushrooms that it came with. Would definitely order again. Whole branzino: my friend liked this. I didn't try it, but it seemed good. Cacio e pepe: delicious!! It's very cheesy and creamy, but in the best ways possible. And that's quite a compliment since normally I don't like cacio e pepe because inherently it's always too creamy for my preference. But they somehow found a balance of creamy cheese goodness that didn't overwhelm me. The pasta is definitely cooked Al dente (as it should be!), so if you're not a fans of that, you'll probably claim this pasta is undercooked..Cute place with a good number of tables. Got the duck and waffle and it was so good! The confit duck was cooked well and the skin was so crispy. The buttermilk waffle could have been crispier. I think had they added some flavor to it, it would have been even better. The mustard maple syrup I thought lacked the spice kick I was expecting from the mustard. The egg was a bit too oily for my liking, but still yummy. Got a side of bacon-I'd skip it. I prefer my bacon a bit chewy yet crisp. Theirs was just crisp and lacked depth of flavor..Perfect weekend brunch spot in soho. If you're wanting an authentic Italian feel, go here! The Parma Benedict is exactly what I needed!.Excellent RestaurantBy Far the Best in the Area and without all the hipe, meaning no wait and definitely always a reservation available.Had the Prosciutto and it comes with Burrata and bruschetta it was amazing.Then the Papardelle a la Bolognese out of this world...Good Service and Ambiance...Excellent Prices, i'd say very inexpensive!!!.Planned a meal for a party of 10 to celebrate my friends 33rd bday. We booked for a Friday night at 730pm and they were able to accommodated the cocktails were delicious, food was incredible, staff was attentive and friendly, and perfected the timing for serving our large group. Highly recommend for any date or group of friends...it is super cute inside!.I got the Beet and Fennel salad for lunch. It wasn't crowded at all and I was seated right away. The salad was a surprising blend of flavor and texture that I wouldn't have normally had in combination, but it was a pleasant surprise..Literally stumbled upon this place having walked by here many times and never noticing it. Was actually heading to another nearby Italian restaurant but noticed the menu outside, liked it, went inside, liked the vibe and so ate here.  Was so happy that I did, best food I have had in Manhattan in a long time. Wanted vegetarian so had the artichokes, rapini and rosemary potatoes.  Best potatoes and rapini I have ever had, and I eat a lot of potatoes.  Sublimely seasoned, not too much salt, the rosemary permeated the entire small potatoes somehow.  Ate at the bar and the bartender had a great vibe and the entire ambiance of vibe of the restaurant was warm and inviting.  Wow, going back every time in NYC..The waitress misheard my friends steak order as chicken and then was rather unfriendly upon correction. The other staff member who came to address the situation was cold and unfriendly.Apparently the chicken takes 28 minutes to cook, so this delayed all of our food. Service overall was slow..Service- Good/Fine. Nothing special. Server was nice but did not go ""above and beyond"". Did not leave a memorable impression.Food-  Ordered the Prosciutto di Parma Burrata Tomato Bruschetta which was great and big enough to be a meal for one person, in my opinion. I also got the Cresta di Gallo squid ink pasta which was not great. The pasta  was very large and thick and I think slightly under cooked. I only took a couple bites and did not finish it since the pasta was so hard. Next time I will ask the server about what kind of pasta is used in the dishes. In other yelp photos, the squid ink pasta looks like regular spaghetti, which I think would've been great.Would try this place again but order something different..It is officially summer brunch season and I highly recommend stopping by this spot to catch up with friends and satisfy your brunch cravings. We had made a reservation for Saturday afternoon through opentable, which was super simple and quick, just in case it would be busy as NYC is opening up again. When we arrived, the host seated us within 5 mins. There are both indoor and outdoor seatings available with plexiglass separating different groups for Covid guidelines, which I really liked because it was slightly crowded. Our waitress (shoutout to Guadalupe) was amazing and so attentive to what we needed. Gave us enough time to look over the menu, and throughout our time there, was proactively checking on us and refilling our water.There are so many diverse options and to our surprise, the portion sizes were greater than expected. We got the Nutella French toast, prosciutto Benedict and crab Benedict with a side of truffle fries. Definitely worth every single bite and price! Everything was cooked and seasoned so well. They also have lots of drinks available, kinda strong though. Overall, I really liked the experience here from the food to the service to the ambiance. Absolutely recommend!!!.Came here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon and it was great! They have outdoor dining and indoor dining. I got the duck & waffle ($18) and a mimosa ($12). If you want a refill it costs ($5). My friends got the prosciutto Benedict ($19) and crab cake Benedict ($20). The portion size was pretty big and I was pleasantly surprised. The waffle was soft and they gave me a decent size duck leg. The eggs were still runny and they have the syrup on the side. The mimosa and bellinis were good here, can definitely taste the champagne. Overall it was a good spot for me and my friends to enjoy a nice brunch."
"I used Yelp to search for this restaurant and sure enough it has lived up to it's excellent recommendation. Loved the food, ambiance and the service..I recently visited this restaurant with the intention to have an amazing family dining experience. The restaurant aesthetic was simple on the inside and outside. Their food was tasty too, however simplicity and taste are not good enough reasons to say I REALLY enjoyed this restaurant. Based on my experience at this establishment 1 star is even too much. For starters, prior to visiting this restaurant I made a reservation 2 days in advance. After traveling a half hour with young children and waiting 10 minutes to speak with the hostess, I was told I never made a reservation. The minute I said ""Hi, I have a reservation"" I was cut off by the hostess and she rudely said ""I said no reservations. I said walk ins only."" She did not even care to hear that I made the reservation 2 days in advance. I was told that we would have to wait 15 minutes for a table, which did not seem like much until it turned into 45 minutes! When we finally sat down, we were placed at a table for 7 when we had a party of 8. It was my mistake however the waiter RUDELY said ""I have no chairs. You said 7."" I understood my mistake, however, there were plenty of chairs outdoors that were NOT being used. If the waiter truly cared about his customer he would have went outside and brought one in. After waiting an hour to be seated, the waiter brought some water and left for 20 minutes to help other parties that came in AFTER mine. When we call a waiter over, he was very rude. He was upset we were not giving him the order fast enough. At this point, it was clear that the restaurant LACKS customer service skills. The waiter later on brought out our meals at DIFFERENT times and one was MISSING. When we told the waiter he got very defensive and made it seem like HIS mistake was OUR fault. The last meal to come out was meant to be shared with a 5 year old. It was truly ridiculous. Upon leaving the restaurant, the hostess came back to speak with us. When I explained to her the initial reason for being upset, she said that she did NOT care and that she does NOT want us back at the restaurant.Before completing this review, I would like to mention how ""sanitary"" this restaurant is by keeping the customer restroom INSIDE the kitchen. I'm truly disgusted with this establishment and I truly DO NOT KNOW how they are STILL in business..Used to come here all the time before the pandemicSeems unfortunate that they closed one section of the restaurant Great food at good pricesRecently got a chicken pad thai and a spicy tofu drunken noodle - both tasted really good.My first time here and such a horrible experience. Staff is beyond rude and not hospitable. Needs training..Stumbled across this place and I was pleasantly surprised! They had a small wine menu and cute outdoor seating. To start they offered some complimentary rice puffs with peanut sauce. The peanut sauce was delicious and it was a great start to the meal! The pork dumplings were good-the meat was juicy, the dumpling wrapper was nice and thin and the sauce was yummy. The pad Thai was better than I expected. It was perfectly saucy, the chicken was tender and it was flavorful. I'd recommend checking out if you're in the area!.Intimate, romantic spot for dinner with delicious food and good drinks. The area is small so waiting on a table isn't very comfortable so call ahead for a reservation. Can't wait to return..Topaz has the best thai food in NYC!! Been coming here since I was little and it's always delicious. Sara, the owner, is also the kindest and most welcoming host. My favorites are the Pad Thai, Winter Shrimp, Spring Rolls, and anything with duck. And I always pair their food with their refreshing thai iced tea I've eaten there during covid too - the most beautiful, eye-catching decorations line the outdoor seating area making any meal there special and memorable. The quality of their food hasn't changed. Topaz is the best!.i'm visiting new york and decided to get some thai food. inside the restaurant had really dim lighting, so it was hard for me to see the menu and my food. the food was really tasty. the pumpkin curry was good and the pumpkin was really soft. the pad thai was also super yummy. service was good. we got seated immediately and they always refilled out water..Food is superb. We live upstate and come down monthly just to eat here. Red curry is our favorite. It's very charming space. Perfect for date night or a family meal..The food was awesome! Probably the best drunken noodle I have ever had! However, the service is horrible! We had asked for cup of ice, a bowl to share soup, and check. They completely forgot about the cup of ice and the extra bowl. For the check, had to remind them at least three times. Felt like they were either rushing and/or just did not care about service."
"Saiguette is so much more than banh mi. Sure, the banh mi is delicious, but all the other sections of the menu sing as well. Try the Crispy Spiced Chicken plate. It's not your average fried chicken cutlet with its 9-spice blend and yam flour coating. The plates easily serve two. Also try their BBQ Ribs. They're hefty, slightly sweet and slightly smokey with some nice char. Their nem - crispy spring rolls - are some of the best I've had. I also love just getting their pho broth to sip along with dinner. It's so delicious and comforting. Unfortunately, Saiguette is pick up only (no delivery) which makes me so sad. Even so, it's worth the trek and a great spot to pick up a picnic for the park..Let me begin by mentioning that I do not typically eat late night meals as my GI tract cannot handle such a schedule. However, I purchased a Banh Mi right before my 4 hour evening bus trip back home. Thinking ahead, I did not want to risk having to use the bus bathroom, so I bided my time. Delicious scents wafted nonstop from the Banh mi to my nostrils, and likely to all of the other passengers', as well. Very lucky for them!By the time I got home it was midnight. I was not that hungry and also weary of eating-induced stomach pains. However, I could not forbid myself from sampling some Banh mi. The samplings turned into voracious chomps and soon enough the entire sandwich (plus side container of hot sauce) was devoured. My body felt like it was going through organ rejection for the rest of the night, but that was through no fault of Saiguette's! If I was told that I could never enjoy a pain-free Banh mi here for the rest of my life, I would still come here over and over again. This will definitely be a staple Banh mi bodega in my life!!.I can't say enough good things about this place. I lived in the neighborhood and would order from Saiguette on a weekly basis once they re-opened after a pandemic hiatus. Their pho is excellent and so is their Bahn mi. Possibly the best Bahn mi I've had in all of nyc. Fish, shrimp, chicken, pork - all of them are solid Bahn mi options! I'd also highly recommend getting their peanut mochi which is so rare and hard to find. They definitely roast the peanuts and make the filling by hand. It's spectacular. I have to say their dumplings are also handmade and jam packed with fillings and in SE Asian style, use a rice flour based dumpling skin. Papaya salad is a good choice. Red curry chicken rice packets are truly a treat. Same with the deep fried tofu skin rolls. I've made my way through 90% of their menu with no complaints. Great service each time!.I'm so glad Saiguette reopened after a long covid hiatus. This place is on all the neighborhood ""top restaurant"" lists and is beloved by locals. Now, I'm sure I am biased here because this is the only place I've had banh mi from, but it's soooooo good. The homemade bread is so soft and flakey. I'm partial to the pork belly banh mi which never disappoints. The spareribs are also super good- tender with a sweet (not too sweet) sauce. Would love to try other items but always find myself reordering these because we love them so much. They don't offer delivery, so make the trip to pick up some takeout..This place is really the definition of hole in the wall but holy crap the Bahn Mi was so good! My friend actually had it on his list and one glance of the yelp page sold me. If the Bahn Mí isn't slapping then I don't know what we're doing here you know? So of course I got one and also I love Bahn Mí (and pretty particular about how they are nowadays). I went for the ~juicy~ chicken thigh! Since we were there on location we just ordered at the window on the corner of the street. There's no where to sit but central park is just two avenues away so it's a pretty good spot to grab a sandwich and picnic. Okay so the sandwich was great?! The bread was a lot softer than I usually except but much more enjoyable in a way that all the juices from that ~juicy~ chicken thigh could soak in the bread without making it soggy. She was also LOADED. There was goodness in every bite. There wasn't as much heat as I was anticipating too so if that's not your thing you should be in the clear. Overall, I would definitely come back here. If this is the only place I go in New York to get a good Bahn Mí then I'll make my way down every time..I had this for the first time when I had covid and it was so good my taste came back! Hands down one of the best bahnmi ive had. Pho was also very good. Will def come back here for all my viet cravings..Delicious bahn mi! My favorite is actually the grilled chicken cutlet. Super juicy and great spices. Great spot for pick-up!.Are my friend put me onto this place and it's become a favorite ever since. This is the first time I try Vietnamese food and now that I've tried other places, I keep coming back to Saiguette.This is all you need to know about this spot: their lemongrass pork Bánh mì has destination vibes. It's a tonguegasm waiting to happen. Bahn mi: 5 Portion to $: 4Fast: veryWorth a crosstown bus: yesWorth a 20 min commute: yes You can't eat in here anymore, but that's what the park is for. Their lemongrass pork is an epic flavor explosion. Did I mention that already? Sweet, tangy, garlicky, blah, blah, blah. It's more wide than long & you'll walk away satisfied. There's a mom joke there, but I'm gonna pass. Yes, it's 2x more expensive than a Chinatown Bánh mì, but it's worth it- Karen. This is my #1 Bánh mì spot. The end..Quick bahn-mi to go is always a classic. The price is right, the flavors are good, and vibe is immaculate"
"Where to begin. Finding a venue for your wedding can be a stressful time. Finding the perfect place to celebrate one of the most important days of your life can be nerve wrecking. The moment we stepped into Deity; me and my wife instantly knew... This is where we wanted to have our wedding. It is just so unique. It is not your typical cookie cutter venue where everyone sits in the same room for hours on end. The different floors may seem unusual at first but seeing how the event folded we wouldn't do it any other way. The building has such history. It used to be a synagogue decades ago so the exposed brick is a huge highlight of its appeal. There is also a Bridal suite which is just impossible to describe. Once you see it you will know you definitely need to book it as well. Great for photos and guys once your girl sees she's going to want it so just go in knowing your gonna get it. The Lobby area where people wait before they go up into the ceremony is so beautiful. The lighting is so intimate. There is also a great tree that you can use (We used it to hang pictures of us since kids all the way to early photos of our relationship....its a cute idea...I know...your welcome). The rooftop also is awesome for pictures, it captures Brooklyn...all of it in its perfect picturesque views.We were worried about the food initially as well to but it was AMAZING. One of our main worries was that there wouldn't be enough of it or that it would be your typical wedding food. We even had several guests that needed Kosher meals and told us personally they were so grateful it wasn't just a typical airplane food for a kosher meal. Caio is so personable. When you get to meet him he treats you like family and honestly thats the vibe you get. We had several meetings with us where he told us over and over again: this is your special day and I want to make it EXACTLY how you envision it. If you had any special requirements you let me know and we will work with you.Caio also has a DJ he works with that was included in the package which was great, it helped us allocate funds elsewhere since we saved money on a DJ and let me tell you DJ Michael Dhundee did not disappoint. I am Puerto RIcan and israeli and my wife is Russian. Michael hopped on a call with us asked us to make a spotify list of what we typically liked so he could get a vibe on how he wanted to set up his playlist. Since he wasn't familiar with Russian Music or Israeli music for that matter he needed to figure out how he was going to navigate the complex transitions. He crushed it. The flow was perfect and everyone said the DJ was top notch.Having a day of coordinator like Anna was honestly one of the best highlights. The day can go quick and Anna was on top of everything with timing and where we needed to be. Caio is definitely the man with the vision, Anna is the woman who makes that vision happen. When we were worried about timing and where we were at in the night (as i said it can go fast haha) Anna calmed us down and reminded us we had ""x"" amount of minutes until ""y"" event. A the end of the night we even had an afterparty at the Bar next door called someday bar. Anna said if we wanted we could even get Pizza's as an after hours snack just in case people were still hungry. I honestly didn't think we needed it but my friends said as full as they were the pizza was a great last minute addition. Now i didn't have uber eats on hand. Anna said not to worry she would take care of it order it from her phone at 10:00 PM and get back to me when the time came. I just venmoed her what I owed her. This is just a small example of the attention to detail they put and how they made our lives easier.Also about that last minute audible. If you are thinking of having an after party....lets be honest you know you want to. There is a Bar literally right next door called someday bar. The bar is awesome and we touched base with them a few weeks before, they assured us they would stay open for us and help facilitate a great end of the night. Which they did. For all of these reasons and more (because I am sure im forgetting some) this is the place you want to have your wedding. I will say that again louder for the people in the back THIS IS THE PLACE YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR WEDDING. It is unique and your guests will not forget a night like this one. Go check it out and see it for yourself..I don't want to be insensitive to anyone hesitant to throw a big celebration at this moment in time, but I will say that we were able to have a party for our daughter's bat mitzvah with just shy of 100 guests and we had a wonderful time that resulted in zero covid cases. And maybe everyone in attendance was hungry for social contact, or a break from worrying or just to be able to celebrate a young woman that most of them have known since she was born, or probably all of the above. But I can easily say that this party, this unforgettably amazing party, this perfectly safe party could only have happened at Deity.Caio, the venue's proprietor, is absolutely dedicated to ensuring that Deity events are great in every way. He devotes great care to major aspects like food and decor, and minor details like ambience and staff traffic flow and establishes partnership and trust with us so that as hosts, we were able to enjoy the party as much as anyone, though nobody had more fun than our daughter, which is exactly how it should be. I want to emphasize the food for a moment: it's excellent, presented beautifully, and we were able to plan a menu that accommodated 1 vegan, 1 gluten free, several vegetarians and the rest of us omnivores so that we all ate well and never had to wait long for a drink either. Also, the way the venue is structured is special. The adults were able to eat, drink and talk in the lounge on the ground floor, while the kids were able to dance to music at a higher volume downstairs, with very easy access to either floor. There's also a beautiful third floor that we didn't use, but could be great for ceremonies and/or sit down dinners. But for our purposes, Deity was perfect and we are still on a high from how much fun every single one of our guests had. 10 stars out of 5..Everything we could've asked for and more. Throughout the chaos that was 2020 (and even 2021) the Deity team was with us from day one. They helped answer questions and took care of everything from the 'big items' to the little details, which was extremely helpful and calming for an out-of-state couple. The beauty of the venue is unmatched and the helpfulness of theteam is top-notch.  A+, two-thumbs up, would recommend!.I cannot say enough about how much of a dream come true Deity Events was for our wedding. From our initial informational meetings, to planning, to day-of service, and overall experience (from our perspective AND our guests'), Deity is a clear Five-Star choice across the board. When my husband and I first were looking for a venue, we knew that we wanted to choose a place that captured the unique spirit of Brooklyn, and also offered a convenient and lively experience for our guests. We looked at many venues in the area, and Deity was the clear winner from the first time we toured. It is important to note that most of the staff at Deity have worked there for many years, and it shows in their expertise and happiness with their work. We really connected with their owner, Caio, and events coordinator from our first meeting. They were able to get a clear idea of our vision, and guide us through the planning process seamlessly. In the end, it was even more beautiful and fun-filled than we could have pictured. In addition to the beautiful, unique decor, our guests continued to compliment the quality of food (delicious!) and fun/lively atmosphere long after the wedding. The design of the dance-floor level and skill of the DJ meant that the majority of our guests spent most of the reception on the dance floor :)Lastly, a really important note on the flexibility and humanity of Caio and staff. My husband and I were scheduled to be married in mid-April of 2020...obviously, that was postponed due to COVID. We ended up having to shift the date several times based on the pandemic, and finally were able to celebrate in Summer 2021. The team at Deity kept in contact with us throughout, offering support with our planning, checking in on our health, etc. We couldn't be more happy with the decision to work with Deity, and to commemorate our love there!.Where do I even begin?  From  the moment that we  walked into Deity we knew it was our wedding venue. The space is absolutely stunning - an old world charm mixed with contemporary elements. The space itself is gorgeous with exposed brick, stained glass windows and beautiful backdrops.  We were sold. We booked Deity for our November 2021 wedding before the pandemic and had no idea what to expect once NY shutdown. Thats' where Caio came in. In the months, weeks and days leading up to our wedding he answered every call, every text, every frantic email. He was patient with us even when I am sure we were annoying ( hello neurotic bride over here). He took care of every detail that I didn't even know needed to be addressed. On the day of our wedding Anna was an absolute gem. She made sure my husband and I were taken care and had everything we needed ( including a shot of tequila just before our ceremony ) . The food was impeccable and our guests raved about the amazing cocktail hour . Dr Dhundee killed it - our entire night was just non stop dancing.  It is very rare that you meet a vendor and instantly know that they are the one - and that is exactly what happened with Deity. I cannot imagine any other venue for the Brooklyn fairytale of our dreams..A really nice venue, but still a questionable location for throwing a pandemic-era wedding.I was overjoyed that my state made it off of Cuomo's coronavirus quarantine list in time for me to fly in for my friends' Brooklyn wedding.  Intimate wedding was well done, with handsome upstairs function room and more whimsical downstairs lounge offering a memorable experience.Steps to prevent coronavirus included a temperature check at the door, extra masks, as well as two-foot spacing between ceremony seating.  However, when it comes to it, the night had to include out-of-town people eating unmasked at an eight-top, as well as forty people drinking in a 30x30 enclosed space.  Not exactly an outdoor venue, and it seemed one pre-symptomatic person away from becoming a superspreader event.Hopefully Deity and its Brooklyn neighbors survive the pandemic ; really want to see this place at it's best..Let me start out by saying that we could not have picked a better venue for our special day.  From the moment we toured the space and met Caio, we knew that Deity was our choice.  Not only is Deity a beautiful venue, but having a multi-floored wedding provided unique and exciting energy at every step of the night.  Below, we break down what makes Deity so special:  Venue:  The venue is unlike any we've ever seen.  From the exposed brick, classic ""Brooklyn under the stars"" vibe in the reception room/dining room, to the magnificent tree that sits uniquely in the middle of the cocktail hour floor and plays nicely off of their octagonal bar, to the stunning rooftop arrangement with an in-ground hot tub, to the picturesque bridal suite that my bridal party spent the entire day getting ready in, to the dance floor, highlighted by their classic ""Brooklyn Love"" sign, disco ball, and full-sized mirror in the back, the entire venue screams one-of-a-kind.  Within minutes of touring the venue, we knew we had to get married here. Food and Drink:  The food at Deity was absolutely excellent.  The hour d'ouevres were an absolute hit, and the staff did a great job of keeping things coming.  Guests reported that this was one of the most filling and tasty cocktail hours they had ever had.  The dinner was also exceptional, providing interesting yet classic options on all types of dinner dishes.  Everyone was raving about the culinary experience from start to finish.  To top it all off, Deity worked with us to create 3 craft ""Cat Cocktails"" that was a smash hit at the wedding.  The drinks were prepared promptly, they were well-made, and the bar offers a wide array of drinks and brands to choose from.  There was never a wait, and everyone drank plentifully during our celebration.  Staff: The staff was exceptional.  Every person had a smile on their faces, was pleasant, and hard-working to make our night function properly.  Caio and Anna have an amazing eye for detail and goes to great lengths to make sure that the little stuff that you do not/should not be thinking about on your special night is taken care of.  It's obvious that they hold a wealth of experience.  From the bartenders to the servers, everyone went above and beyond.  The Party:  It was the dance party of the century.  Deity provided an absolutely epic DJ, in BenHa Meen, who took us on a journey with our ears, that translated into a night of nonstop movement, sweat, and screaming.  For weeks after our wedding, people continued to tell us how amazing Ben was, and how great the music that he chose was.  As a professional DJ working with some amazing artists, he really knew how to mix and ride the vibe of the night.  Caio:  Without a doubt, one of the most influential factors for hosting our wedding at Deity was the owner himself, the legend that is, Caio Dunson.  Caio is warm, friendly, accommodating, and professional.  With years of experience in this industry and having built Deity from the ground up with his own bare hands, it's obvious that he cared about our day being special just as much, if not more, than we did.  This pandemic brought about many challenges, including having to postpone our date, and Caio was there every step of the way, always available on calls, emails, or texts.  Please believe me when I say that WE COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN A BETTER BUSINESS PARTNER, EVENT PLANNER, AND FRIEND, TO HELP US MAKE THIS WEDDING WHAT IT TURNED OUT TO BE.  Working with Caio was easy and enjoyable..Nestled in the heart of Downtown Brooklyn is one of the most intimate and memorable venues you will find for a wedding. We locked in our date before COVID and two years later all the waiting was well worth it! To start Caio is one of the most genuine and professional people you will meet and someone we sincerely call a friend. Every single detail from the door opening, to guests arriving to our departure at the end of the night was covered without us having to worry about a thing. We were hesitant to pull in a million different vendors and when it came to the food, logistics and venue, all the big points were covered. Our florist, photographer and videographer were welcomed as part of the family and worked seamlessly with the rest of the Deity team. Both my wife and I are sticklers for food and music, and both of these areas were above and beyond what you would anticipate from a typical wedding. The most important part of the day was that we were able to to relax and focus on the experience and the friends around us. All of the 'happenings' behind the scenes were 'unseen,' with the staff taking care of all the details and any issues (none) without us even knowing. Thank goodness we had such great photos to remember the day, because it was an absolute dream and we couldn't have been happier. Thank you again and much love to the Deity family and to Caio!.Caio, Caio! I really don't have words on how much we appreciate your kindess and patience. Like many couples who was suppose to get married in 2020, it was sadly a no-go due to the pandemic. We had to reschedule multiple times and we finally had a date in 2021. It was a lot of back and forth with Caio and he was really responsive and that was truly appreciated. The day of the wedding, we booked the bridal suite and omg... please, PLEASE book the bridal suite, it's lifesaving! It was raining on the day we got married so we didn't get to use the rooftop but the bridal suite was EVERYTHING! Trust me, you will not regret booking the bridal suite. We had a lot of freedom to do what we want and if we need Caio and his staff, they're right there to help. Honestly, this was the first venue space we checked out and we booked it on that very day. I'm from Brooklyn and I just loved how this space encapsulated the look and feel of Brooklyn, right in the center of Brooklyn..My Deity wedding was an absolute dream, and that is largely thanks to the amazing staff that made sure everything ran as smoothly as possible. Planning a wedding in a pandemic is no easy task but Caio really worked with my husband and I to make sure it was an amazing day while keeping everyone's safety at utmost importance. We had frequent emails, phone calls, and meetings throughout the planning process to make sure no detail was left out and that everyone was being accommodated. On the day of, our coordinator Anna also went above and beyond to make sure my husband and I were enjoying ourselves and absolutely mastered our schedule/ timeline. Our families are not easy people to keep on track but Anna did it all flawlessly!Deity is such an amazing venue in that the space is so versatile and diverse you feel like you're at a different venue with each floor. Thanks to the bridal suite, I didn't have to stress about where to get ready with my bridal party and then coordinate more travel in time for photos. The rooftop was great for cityscape photos and we even walked around the neighborhood for some great shots. The ceremony space was flipped for dinner and Deity staff made sure transitions to and from floors were seamless. Our guests loved having the lounge space open all night as well as a break from the dance floor.The food was phenomenal. Cocktail hour and dinner were knocked out of the park and our guests had nothing but amazing things to say about the food. Seriously, if we could get our hands on that BBQ chicken recipe we would. Our DJ Ben was also fantastic. One of our deciding factors in choosing Deity was that our package came with a DJ already and Ben did not miss. He kept our friends and families dancing and just a great overall vibe to the night.When initially booking Deity, we were a little concerned about the 2 flights of stairs at the venue but Caio also made sure that our elderly guests were comfortable and received any assistance needed throughout the night which was HUGELY appreciated. On top of it being such an affordable, all-inclusive, prime NYC spot, I cannot recommend Deity enough!"
"The restaurant was pretty busy when I went and the atmosphere was just really lively. To start off, my server was great, and although she didn't know some of the dishes, was very helpful. The food came out relatively quickly and the portions are huge. We got a dish for every person and we still had a lot left. I can't remember the prices but I remember them being reasonable. It was just a great experience overall..For dinner on a Wednesday Night, we only ordered Huancaina for appetizer, Mixto Ceviche & Whole Chicken (comes with salad and rice).  Total costs is $81.  I do remember Mixto Ceviche at $23. If the 3 dishes, yes Three, run at $25 per dish  plus tax, then later another tip. I left $90+ cash, It's steep when I thought about it. My mistake is I didn't take a good look at the receipt. My advise is just do take outs. We've known Inca since it was near Grasmere station so I won't elaborate on food quality..... bottom is: they'll trick you IF you're not careful (like me). Also, don't go on Wednesday. Chicken was dry and overcooked. Ceviche and easy- to-make huancaina Eggs were better. Salad was ordinary lettuce and watered spicy mayo (the same concoction you eat with nacho chips)..Quaint, small and authentic. I have eaten Peruvian in Manhattan and this place beats them with affordable price and high quality. Peruvian dish is unique in its own. The Ceviche is fresh and clean, presentation of food is quite appetizing to see.The grilled Octopus was great. Steak is ok and the chicken is ok. Margarita is nice and strong.  Custom service could be better! Food is also little salty..I came here on a Saturday afternoon and we were the only ones inside. The waitress was extremely nice and made sure that we were ok with everything. I've definitely had a lot better Peruvian food but there isn't a lot of peruvian restaurants in Staten Island. The food to me was very bland and just didn't have any flavor at all. I was definitely confused when I got the check. If I had known that they would charge for a glass of water I would've gotten a soda since the soda was a dollar less than a glass of water. I know that usually the price is on the higher end but I don't think it was worth it for this restaurant..Wow, what a place. The Ceviche was outstanding, the flavor combos were so well balanced. You get a nice plate of raw Basa with pickled onions, cilantro and a soup of lime juice. Truly delicious. The fish was tender, and I only wished it was sea bass rather than Basa. I also recommend their Marino Trio. This is a triple appetizer combo that comes with the ceviche, as well as fried calamari, and a grilled octopus tentacle over a pile of mashed potato and avocado. At $38, it was worth it! The Octopus was a bit rubbery though, but everything else was great. I think their grilled Shrimp over guacamole topped tostones was also good. Very light, simple dish, big portion, and reasonably priced. My favorite however is their crab cakes, loaded with lumped crab, lightly spiced, and topped with a heaping pile of pickled red onion and pico di gallo!.Absolutely delicious food! Ceviche was so fresh and yummy. First thing on a table were dried beans with spicy green sauce- couldn't stop eating it! Seafood soup was very big and very tasty. Lamb chops- awesome. Sangria- nice and strong! Overall, great food.Waitstaff, especially woman with blue hair, helps make this experience to eat in feel like youre at your bffs place. Super friendly and warm and has great recommendations.  5 stars for service. Food: ive been here twice in 3 days. I had the appetizers: 1)crabcakes-best ive had in my life. Good ratio of breading to crab, not too fishy. 2)shrimp in tostones, shrimp well seasoned, this was very filling, probably wouldnt order again 3) scallop ceviche - amazingly fresh ingredients, scallops on smaller side . Def recommend now entrees 1) seafood paella. The rice was just ok, stuck together and the shrimp felt rubbery from being over cooked. The clams, octupus and squud ringlets were fresh and cooked perfectly. Its meant to share by at least 3 people, dont order it for 1 unless tou want leftovers for 4 days like me. 2) the flank steak, both times it came out ordered by two different friends- it was perfection. Shrimp were cooked perfectly and it comes with asparagus and tostones. Def recommend for someone looking for filling and delicious protein heavy meal. 3) braised lamb, i wanted to be in love with this dish and it was probably because i was too full , but the lamb was a bit tough to cut through with a butter knife. I dont eat rice. So i mixed it with the onions it came with and the delicious cheese sauce. If i had it by itself, i think i wouldve enjoyed it more but i was so stuffed. Fyi, this place is not cheap. Lunch cost me 180$ with just two alcoholic cocktails for my eating companion and the second time im sure it was at the 100+ mark. The food loses one star for those minor details but it is overall an experience that you will feel really happy and good about and will want to keep returning for their quality of food and service..We should have read the reviews before going. They definitely have some sort of scam working of overcharging and overpricing. We ordered 2 pieces of rotisserie chicken which each come with fries or rice (on menu listed as $13). My husband asked for rice and beans and a side of tostones. Obviously knew we'd pay for the tostones, no problem. Mine came regular. We ordered one appetizer which was very small ($8), 2 seltzers and an apple juice for my daughter. The bill comes...and it's almost $70. They charged us $15 for my husband's chicken plus $6 for rice, plus $5 for beans. How? Then they added a 20% (!!!!) gratuity which in my opinion is outrageous. What ever happened to customers being able to tip according to service? We shouldn't be told how to tip. Then it made sense they charged it because after that they get to charge a service fee on top for a debit card. So because they charge the tip in and service fee after, they make more money off the tip. We felt taken. Will not be going again. A basic dinner for 2 for $70, no thanks..This was my first time having Peruvian food. It was good. The waitress was so sweet. She was really attentive and courteous. I wish I would've gotten her name..I went here on a whim one night when I was both in the need for a quick meal, and in the mood to celebrate Peruvian restaurant week.When I walked in, the owner was an absolute gentleman. He explained what they do best and made recommendations.I went with the whole chicken and fries, as well as some chicken empanadas.The chicken was so perfectly seasoned that my girlfriend was inspired to mimic it for our Thanksgiving turkey. I'll definitely be back."
"My daughter and I are still talking about how we stumbled across this restaurant. Charmaine was incredibly welcoming and accommodating, so much so that we felt that we had been invited into her home. The food....we don't know if we have any words to describe the pork ribs, burrata, lamb pasta and seafood pasta. ABSOLUTELY THE BEST FOOD WE HAVE EVER TASTED. This will be a regular spot for us. Thank you Charmaine and Paco (forgive spelling)..Their pasta is outstandingly delicious! I traveled a lot in Europe and their pasta tasted better than most restaurants in Europe. I was so shocked by the flavor and comprehension of the dishes. My friend is Italian and he was shocked at how good it is too. This is a must-try in New York. If it's not my friend who took me to this spot I will not know about this place. I'm so grateful.I heard this is a husband & wife restaurant, the husband is the chef and the wife is the server. I love it and I think it's so cute! They're super friendly and attentive. If you're in NYC, you have to try this..A great little date spot. Very small, intimate dining room. Low-lit at night (not great for food pictures).The pasta dishes are very good. We did have to ask for some salt, but that was all that was missing. The portions are smaller than you'd expect from a chain restaurant but larger than something you'd get from a Michelin star place. It strikes a happy medium, and, honestly, it's probably the amount of pasta you should eat during a meal (coming from a serial pasta-overeater). This is definitely a place you want to make a reservation for on a Friday night or weekend. Service is friendly. Wait times for food are reasonable.When we went, the squid ink pasta was sold out. It seems like a hot item, so make a reservation and go early!.Dang, this place rocks. Been living up the block for 6 months and was jonesing to be here for my birthday and it was a better present than I could've imagined. First, the small amount of seating made us feel really welcomed and taken care of. It was a hot day and the server was so nice about making sure we were hydrated. The byob touch was actually quite great and was happy to provide some booze of our own! The food was stellar. The server was so nice and put a candle on our burrata appetizer, which was SUMPTUOUS with the prosciutto. The pasta dishes themselves were outstanding. The lamb ragu was spicy and so delicious, and the shrimp over squid ink pasta was outrageous. My partner and I ended up swapping dishes because they were just so good! Would absolutely come here for a special occasion or simply for a date night..I have become a regular here because the food is consistently amazing and it's not typical pasta dishes. I love any of the shrimp or the wild boar entrees. Everything is very fresh including the pasta and also visually stunning. The espresso ribs and the burrata with spicy honey  are outta this world. Last but not least we get the chocolate mousse every time we come and it does not disappoint! Heated outdoor dining during covid too..This is the best Italian restaurantt in the neighborhood, or even in Brooklyn for that matter. The duck and the squid ink pasta dishes were absolutely amazing! The pasta was clearly freshly made and tasted divine. They gave us a parmesan amuse bouche that was to dye for. I cannot wait to come back and try more dishes. FYI it's BYOB.Nicandra's is an instant must-visit dinner spot in our neighborhood. It's a really great dinner/date spot with delicious top-notch food and zero pretentiousness. We came here randomly on a Sunday afternoon for a quick dinner. They were able to offer us an outdoor seat for two without a reservation. (However, a reservation is highly recommended, especially indoor seating).It is a BYOB but they do offer free bottles of water. We started with Espresso Glazed Pork Ribs with micro watercress - the perfect blend of sweet and savory. It literally falls off the bone onto your utensils. An amazing starter dish that sets the right tone for the meal! For our main course, we had Fettuccine with Wild Boar Shoulder, chipotle sauce & golden raisins AND Scialatielli Lamb Ragù with asparagus & roasted red pepper. The Scialatielli dish had the right spice kick that was subtle and flavourful. The Fettuccine dish, again, excellent combination of savory and sweet.Overall, it was PERFECTION! The pasta was well-prepared and the dishes themselves were well proportioned and satisfying. They really nail the flavor palate! The service was efficient with very personable wait staff. We didn't have to wait long for our food. We literally dined in about an hour. This place is definitely great for a dinner for two or a slightly larger group ordering family style. Our only regret is that we didn't have dessert but we will back definitely! Just a COVID note, we were given plastic utensils with every course. However, the outside dining was simple but very pleasant!.Honestly if I could make a living off singing Nicandra's praises for the rest of my life, I'd gladly start my world tour today.Where do I even start!? I've lived in the neighborhood almost five years, been here countless times and they never fail to blow me away completely (and everyone I've brought along, too). Who doesn't love a BYOB mom and pop where you can taste the heart in every bite? Can't wait for the brunch to be back in action. Love y'all!!.We didn't have a reservation but they let us in :) (We were lucky)  The waitress was really nice and friendly. We brought a bottle of wine and ordered one appetizer and one pasta. That was enough potions for two. And served with cute plates :) Burrata comes with pesto? and honey was so fresh!! The pasta was amazing! Well done and the hint of pepper. We enjoyed the meals. Will definitely come back and try something out soon. Thank you..Impressed. Simple but awesome, generous portions, kitchen hit the pick up time to the minute..EXPERIENCE:Love Nicandras! I've never had one bad thing from this place. There are 2 tables and a few covered, outdoor tables so make sure you make a reservation if you'd like to sit indoors! It's also BYOB which I LOVE so I bring 2 bottles of my favorite wine every time. If you forget, there is a liquor store close by for you to run and grab something if you need to! Upon entering the owner Sharmane, , temperature checked us and provided us with hand sanitizer. She is the sweetest! She came to our table and chatted for a bit and made sure everything was to our liking! FOOD: So for appetizers, I always go for the ribs. They are delicious, fall of the bone, and perfect for sharing. Usually go with a friend or 2 and we can each have about 2 and that's all you need especially when you get another app. The burrata is also delicious, served with some pesto sauce and prosciutto very good. Now the mushrooms, I've never been a huge mushroom fan, literally avoid anything with mushrooms but these are the exception! They are crispy, well seasoned, and I would definitely get again. As for the entrees, I have had almost every kind on the menu and they are all delicious! My favorites are the fettuccine with wild boar shoulder and the linguine aglio e olio with shrimp! Both very tasty, very flavorful, great portion size ( I end up taking about half home due to stuffing my face with apps, which always makes for a great late night snack or next day lunch lol) For dessert, the chocolate literally the best type of chocolate mousse like dessert I've ever had. Has a touch of sea salt and lemon zest and for looks, GOLD. Yes, GOLD leaf! So cute and tasty. The creme brûlée, the first time I tasted it was a life changing experience! I took one to go last time because I couldn't get enough! Both desserts are perfect for sharing as it's just the right amount to hit that craving for something sweet. Overall, I definitely recommend everyone to try, you won't regret it!"
"I absolutely adore dig inn so imagine how thrilled I was to find one conveniently located a brisk walk away from my job. I speedwalked there and luckily there was only a short line.Dig inn is known for serving fast casual farm to table meals. They take basic ingredients and season them to absolute perfection. The result is a delicious, healthy, and nutritious meal. I feel like I could eat it every day. Your meal starts with choosing a base, followed by 2 sides, a main protein, and 2 sauces. That gets you the cheapest option at ~$10, the farmer's bowl. I chose a fiber rich grain called farro, mixed with their roasted chicken, cauliflower and Mac and cheese. The chicken is so moist, smooth, and mouthwateringly delicious. The cauliflower was a close second. I did choose a pesto sauce on the side but everything tastes delicious even without it.One small hiccup was that I was overcharged for my bowl because they thought I got 3 sides. I told the cashier and she immediately offered me another side which I happily accepted.I definitely will be returning here next time I'm too tired to cook lunch..So much potential, but the delivery was just lacking... literally... I ordered two bowls off Uber Eats for scheduled delivery. They arrived on time, which was great! However, the food itself was very much lacking in several aspects. For one bowl, I ordered a base of greens- but found only a few leaves of spring mix and cabbage under the rest of the ""sides."" The avocado I added (for a whole $2.45!) was half bruised and brown (see pic). I must add though, the roasted sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, kale and citrus salad, and herb roasted squash were amazing in their own right (and wonderfully vegan), but the portion sizes were also very small. I feel like my experience would have been better ordering in person, which I may do one day, but considering the price and portions, I think I would prefer a hearty noodle bowl from next door..Already can't wait to go back!!!! Everything looked so good I wish I could've gotten it all. Staff was nice and gave me their favorite recommendations which I loved. I built my own bowl made up of Alaskan salmon, sweet potatoes, half cabbage half rice with pesto & garlic aoli and loved every bite.everything was so perfectly seasoned which I am huge on too and not too oily. I couldn't decide which sides so a staff member gave let me choose 2 and just that made me want to go back just because of that kindness. Can't wait for them to offer dine-in just because I had to walk a ways just to find somewhere to sit and eat..It's a funny thing, this place reminds me of healthy home cooking. I love the chicken and the cauliflower, any of the veggies... I typically pick a bowl and run with it, but since on keto... I have to limit carbs, so no Mac and cheese for me... which is tough..Almost can be considered a classic spot on the UES since everything else has closed! This gem remains open and the food is super healthy. I absolutely love the options and seasonings on the meats and veggies. Its truly a great option at any time of day and the price is also decent. they have great drinks, like a carbonated ginger mint refresher which kind of blew my expectations. Overall staff are really sweet and the space is clean..Dig Inn is indeed a chain but a pretty decent one at that.  However, it's important to get the right things.  The chicken breast is really dry but the meatballs are alright.  The kale and mac n cheese are good.  All in all though, I think that the price point should be a little bit lower for what it is.  I wouldn't go out of my way for it but if I was absolutely starving and there was nothing else reasonable nearby, I would stop by again..I was happy this place opened right near me but the food has  severely declined over the years (used to go to one downtown). I got the salmon with a farro base and two sides. The farro and broccoli were ok but the sweet potatoes was burnt. The portions are TINY. But the worst part was the salmon. It was awful. I've tried it now three times and it is always dry, over cooked and tastes like it's from three days prior. I'm honestly shocked that this is what is going out of this place. Called the store and was met with attitude on the phone which is a real shame especially when I'm trying to support local businesses. What an overall horrible experience..Food was good. It's set up like Chipotle, you can either order off the menu or go down the line and say what you want in your bowl. I had farro, chicken thighs, roasted spicy cauliflower and roasted sweet potato wedges, my bf had brown rice (unseasoned), sweet potatoes, chicken thighs and their version of mac and cheese. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the rice and farro bases need to be seasoned and that mac and cheese was horrible. I'm sure it's healthy, but even Kraft tastes better..Tasty everyday healthy food that I would definitely go to many times. They have yummy sauces as well to go with their variety of options. I do wish it was a little less pricey and depending on who is working there, you can have a stickler for portion size (they literally took food out of my plate)..Great, casual, healthy lunch place. Better deal than Sweetgreen which is right next door. I usually get the spicy lime leaf salmon and I am happy with it. I like that they automatically put the sauce on the side."
"Sweet staff and usually very fast - they put drinks out for mobile orders, for a simple grab'n'go and they never mess up any orders. I love that! I only wish they had Nitro Cold Brew at this location - they are always out of stock, even early at 6:30 in the morning..Pretty nice Starbucks location actually. Long layout as it seems this spot is a block long. Nice interior design and signage. Seating area past pick up area when allowed again. What struck me was the super friendly and fun barista who helped me with my order. She made my day even though it was just a simple coffee and croissant..My go to Starbucks seeing as it's the closest to me. Gina was such a doll this morning! She made me the perfect iced americano! She listened to what I wanted even though I wasn't sure how to place my order. She also reminded me how to order it for future reference. If only all baristas were like her!!! Wait times in the morning can be long so be sure to use the app to order ahead. Not so bad throughout the day..I stopped in to grab a coffee this morning and was so happy with the service! All the workers were friendly and helpful. I ordered a slice of pumpkin bread and an iced nonfat latte. Both were great! The pumpkin loaf was super fresh and moist and the latte came out quick and tasted great. I definitely recommend this spot to get your Starbucks fix on!.Great location that is conveniently located on a busy corner of 57th & 10th avenue. Indoor space is a bit small and kinda dark/congested. I'd suggest sitting outside. Good to just grab coffee & go. Music at 7am was loud hip hop (thought that energy may be better later in the day). You'll find a mix of construction workers and locals early on. Service was quick considering I just ordered a basic black coffee. I wasn't asked my name, but just called hun (and no hun was not written on my cup lol). Overall okay service for a quick coffee to go, but probably not a place I could study or get much work done with load music, nearby construction, and busy location..This location has the potential to be good seeing how they have a lot of employees behind the bar but unfortunately each time I'm in here there's another problem with this place.Its usually a bit dirty which could be due to how busy it usually is but still there's no excuse for a puddle of coffee in the middle of the store and a piss soaked bathroom. Take one of your many employees behind the bar fumbling over each other and have them clean the store a little more often.Wait times here are also long regardless of how you order whether its mobile or on-line. I usually have to wait for 10+ minutes for my drink that usually costs a premium $5.Another thing that I noticed with this location is the caliber of the people they hire. Miserable, unhappy, and should reconsider being baristas. Starbucks as a whole used to hire good people but lately not so much..Staff is rudest Starbucks staff I have ever encountered - bad attitudes, don't say your welcome ect. Drinks come out incorrect and late. And if you're trying to get work down good luck the staff play profane music (like WAP) very loudly. Not a place for a good service, good coffee, or a decent atmosphere to work.This Starbucks is the baristas personal playground..A decent amount of seating with plugs so you can get some work done. But yet again, the music is stupidly, headache-inducing loud. It's a shame because the staff is super fast and so friendly I'd like to come back. Instead I'm forced to find someplace quieter..Whoever was the young woman as the Barrista today who made my Chai Latte at 8:50AM had a TERRIBLE attitude. She didn't know I was waiting on 3 warmings and gave me an attitude saying ""Your drink is right in front of your face"" untill I had told her I was still waiting. Then (AS A PERSON WHO DEINKS A CHAI LATTE EVERY DAY FOR THE LAST 11 YEARS) when I take the Stopper lit my drink i immediately notice there was no whip that I asked for. I KINDLY ask her if she can add whip to my drink and she makes a face like she was annoyed. She (the only one at the bar at the moment) asked me to open the lid with an attitude. All you see is white foam and BUBBLES... then she looks at me like I'm an idiot just to tell me ""there's whip already in there"" only because she saw the color was white but had no knowledge that it was just foam , although we both knew she didn't. I was so frustrated, 9 months pregnant and tired from running errands right before, that I had stood quiet. Was it really that difficult for her to just add the whip cream? Or does she treat everyone the same? I was disgusted. I don't spend $6 on a Drink for someone to treat me with a NASTY ATTITUDE for asking for whip cream. If only she knew this is the ONLY drink I get everyday for the last 11 years, then I would of been right from the start. But she lied and had an attitude doing so. I couldn't even argue I didn't have the energy over a drink. She was VERY RUDE AND LAZY..The service at this place is top notch. I'm there nearly every morning and each person is ALWAYS in a great mood. Sweet, helpful, kind. The service here is really top notch. Also, the music is always clutch. Early 2000's that's my jam. Thank you everyone!"
"I don't usually do this, but this review is based off of a pick up order.  Working remotely today and in the field, I needed something quick and fast while on the run (story of my life).  I heard good things about Beijing Dumpling, and let's be honest...you got me at ""dumpling""! I was STARVING for some reason, so I went ham and ordered a bunchhhhhhh of stuff, which included Boiled Wonton Dumplings with Spicy Sauce, Boiled Assorted Dumplings, Pan Fried Assorted Dumplings and Dan Dan Noodles.  These dumplings were TOP NOTCH!  I really enjoyed the boiled shrimp dumplings, which were featured in the assorted order.  The Dan Dan Noodles had a nice little kick and also had a nice heat on the back end.  The wonton dumplings in the spicy sauce weren't too spicy and I thoroughly enjoyed them as well!  I was so happy to grab these dumplings and excited to know I have a new go-to grab and go if needed!.Dumplings were okay. Tastes the same as if you got them at a cheap Chinese restaurant. I thought they would be extraordinary because dumplings are their specialty.The other menu options like Peking duck sandwich and dandan noodles were meh. I have tasted better. Only thing I really liked was the coconut boba milk tea from here. That was really creamy smooth and good..Their menu items are pretty cheap, and unfortunately the food reflects it. The only thing worth eating here is the fried dumplings but beware, they are pretty stingy on the filling, but they're very tasty.The wontons are inedible, the skin is so thick and there's so much of it and there's literally a tiny dot of meat filling that is completely overworked and hard as a rock.The sesame pancakes aren't bad but don't bother getting any with meat in them because you're paying additional money for something that you cannot taste. Duck, beef, pork....it makes no difference because there's so little that you don't even know it's there. All you taste is the overwhelming cucumber that excrete so much water that makes the pancake soggy. However, if you just got the plain pancake, then bring it home, then throw it in the oven to crisp, it's definitely worth the price!.These were terrible dumplings. I came here excited to try everything but the dumplings had such a weird taste. Go to Beijing dumpling house in Jamaica this place stole their name from them and their entire menu but there is no comparison with the food.Once again- another year of superbowl and this place continues to not fail.  Platter of dumplings were ordered and is always always always a hit.  This year we also changed it up with their fresh noodles!  All foods are made fresh daily even through the pandemic, they continue to offer best quality ingredients. It is seen through the many orders we have made.  Travelled from two towns away even during the snow storms!Please support your local businesses!!!  Businesses like Beijing Dumpling is the reason why the area continues to offer great delish foods and options to choose from..I could not wait to share this but we ordered platters for our superbowl party!! Even though the Patriots were sooo boring , our party was a huge hit.  We had a huge crowd and the catered foods worked out. We had white castles, wings, crazy desserts, philly steaks, and plenty of chips dips, and various foods.  So with this assortment, we added a huge platter of dumplings, steamed wontons with spicy sauce including the sesame sandwiches.  And their catered portions were so huge - perfect for our hungry crowds.  The craziest part was that the price tag fromBeijing Dumplings came out to be cheaper than the rest of our other orders!  Works for me with the budget.  Furthermore, the guests killed the dumplings and wontons and instead, had leftover white castles instead.  THERE is NEVER any leftovers with white castles - NEVER. This is the first year that has happened.  Most guests commented on the savory wontons and that was the biggest hit!******I actually decided to round up friends to celebrate a bday lol. Figure this would be an economical yet delicious spot to organize a little shindig. The only thing that is a bit of a challenge was the seating and the aisle being a bit tight for additional seats.  I would still recommend a get together but just plan that this would be a quick eat.   But as our group was there, people just kept coming in-- so it was a good sign that their food selection were really a big hit.  First time trying the chicken teriyaki and it was all gone!  I did not even want to share.  Posting the pics to show what our friends shared and ultimately we had a good time..I only happened to stop by this place because of a nearby dance school.  Otherwise, I would never think a dumpling place (more prominent in Manhattan or Flushing) would ever be in Forest Hills!  Just needed a spot to drop in for a quick lunch. This was a good spot - clean with seats, etc.  Only down part is no bathrooms so please do not expect to visit the John while you're here - expect this to be a take out scenario or quick bite joint.  But this makes a great place to gather up some friends... which is why it is worth mentioning that a few noteworthy things happened as a result of this unexpected visit.Just only ordered a few small plates (which is perfect because ordering one entree is not going to work out if it ends up not to anyone's liking).  So i always prefer appetizer-type-of-dishes to try out and always have more options in the end.  Plus one can explore the menu without breaking the bank nor wasting food (if it does not tastes good, hehe).Please check out pics.  The spicy soft looking dumpling photo was not really that spicy so that works out.  I guess it is good in case that if it was ever not spicy enough - one can always add more as the condiments are always readily on the tables.   What struck me that was positive, was that it was ""hand made"" or in other words, home made noodles or dumpling skins.   So to me, freshness is important since they lack preservatives and whatever else to keep it lasting.  I think the handmade quality makes a difference in taste and texture anyways.  It would be more obvious in the noodles.  The dumplings if fried or steamed would also have a chewier texture than if it was pre-made from another process.   Meanwhile, you order the meals and pay... wait for your # to be called and go and pick it up when ready.  That is probably what not many people expected - to have your # called.  So be aware next time you visit to make sure you know your # before throwing away your receipt.They have bubble tea assortments and it seems okay.  I think the highlight is really the dumplings and beef noodles soup.  Seems like that is what I hear being ordered the most.  Also I saw the staff cooking up the noodles in teriyaki style on the grill - which smells very good.  (Probably at our next visit.)Upon checking out the menu, I saw the frozen dumplings option.  As I was viewing the frozen availabilities was thinking how customers are going to know how to cook the dumplings at home.  And then after the turn of the page on the menu, there was an instruction to cook the frozen dumplings that you buy!  That is so hilarious!  It is ingenious but at the same time, pretty funny that one can just buy and do it at home anytime they want, since it is frozen anyways. Meanwhile, I also realized that I plan to order superbowl platters from here.  It is affordable and easier to eat with dumplings.  It is like wings but easier to eat and can last long for the entire game.  So for this year's superbowl, that is the plan.  After I left, I also contacted a few friends in the neighborhood to ask them about this place.  They have not heard of it since it is relatively new that just opened - but plans to go as a result of my inquiry.  So that also led to another planned hangout - will probably end up meeting here in the future.  The very nice places in Manhattan that used to offer affordable dumplings and small platters have closed down.  The one on eldridge is also WAY too crowded.  So this is actually a great new joint to try out since there are ample seatings.  But again, this would be for a quick get together and nothing too lengthy.  Also, the prices are reasonable for 2019.  If people are complaining that dumplings are no longer $1, that is because they are still living in 1999 and that is sheer ridiculous.  Parking is meter spots, but recommended to find spaces in the side streets and just walk.  Otherwise, the train station is also conveniently nearby, too.  We will definitely be coming back to try out other items on the menus.  I think if we had more people, there is more variety to order so we can share.  5 stars for food selections and prices.  10 stars for customer service..I come here for snacks like their steamed buns. I use to get their sesame pancakes and it was amazing I but I found out I can't have them because they fry it in the same stove as their meats :( which makes me sad cause those sesame pancakes were my favorite thing to get from here. I hope in the future they cook these type of items without meat separate from the meat for my fellow halal/vegetarian/vegan eaters. They do have other things that seem to be okay for us though like their steamed veggie buns, steamed dumplings, etc. i tried their shrimp dumplings and veggie dumplings and it's pretty good. Everything here is pretty affordable and the staff is friendly. Other than the cross contamination of the meat, I have no complaints.Great little spot!Food: ordered dumplings and buns. For a place with the name dumpling in it I expected something spectacular. They were not bad... Actually pretty good just nothing out of the ordinary. Good flavor especially for veggie option. Bubble tea was also great. They only gave me one dumpling sauce for my whole order not nearly enough so just make sure you ask for extra or a specific number. Will have to go back and ask for extra for leftovers. Can't wait to go back and try the sesame sandwich and tofu teriyaki Price: amazing price especially for this area which likes to upcharge due to location. Even though the size of dumplings not large they are still priced right and steamed buns are very large so also priced right!Service: staff is friendly and patient. It was my first time there and had no clue what to order. Some advice is to deffinately order in advance for pick up because even for my small order i had to wait 15 minutes. Call aheadOverall with tiny drawback i will definitely be coming here again and trying the other items on the menu..Had delivery from this place today and whoop! I upgraded my rating to 5 because dang they did so well! Food was delivered on time (or even early I wasn't too sure!) Food was well-packed and it came in excellent condition. I ordered - Boiled Chive and Pork Dumplings- Boiled Wonton Dumplings with Spicy Sauce- Sesame Pancake Sandwich with Peking DuckThe dumplings were not too big but it was delicious and the fillings are really tasty. The wonton was superb! It's fat with fillings, the wrapping was soft, and the spicy sauce went really well with the whole dish. It wasn't too spicy or greasy. Initially I thought they will be stingy with the pancake fillings but nope. Decent amount of duck. I'm satisfied both with the price and what I get. I think I will actually include this place in my favorite delivery list..Been wanting to try this place for a while because I love dumplings. it was more of a takeout place although they do hve several small tables. i chose to dine in though. the lady at the counter was friendly, patient, and helpful. Ordered the random assortments of dumpling (contain 8 pcs), and vegetable sesame pancakethe dumplings were nothing extraordinary. in fact i was quite disappointed. it's smaller than expected. flavor wise it's not that good either. in fact i dont really like the Shrimp Dumplings, so i wasn't impressed which is a shame since i already like the service and indeed the price is affordable. however the sesame pancake was such a winner!! i was so surprised when i took a bite. didn't expect it to be so good! trust me i hate the description ""crispy on the outside and soft on the inside"" because it sounds so generic but that's exactly what the sesame pancake was like. the inside was not just soft, but has the right amount of chewiness. the texture was really enjoyable! generous filling, tasted great too! the sesame pancake does so much more justice than the dumplings!.Tasty, affordable food! High quality, high quantity, and affordable. My favorites are the sesame pancake with Peking duck and the pan fried dumplings with chili oil. I think that's more than enough to fill you up but I usually order a bit more as well for leftovers for the next day..Hidden amongst many other restaurants & establishments on Queens Blvd in Forest Hills, one can easily miss this small spot whilst walking or driving, but you wouldn't be missing out on much, to be honest.The beef noodle soup I ordered barely had much soup in it (I feel like it should be filled 75% vs halfway filled). The beef pieces were pretty decent and tender, but broth and noodles were nothing special. It does get the job done if you're looking for a quick, easy, filling, inexpensive meal (only $7 for the soup).For a dumpling house, I wish they also had more variety for the dumplings. They also changed their menu a bit in that they no longer offer a 4-pc option for dumplings in case you wanted a small sample to try. Wish they would add or change their pork dumpling option to include cabbage as opposed to chives, but perhaps that is more of a personal preference."
"I texted my friend after finding this place on google maps/foods and seeing the almost 5.0 star average from 20 reviews. I told them, either I found a gem or if you don't hear from me in 1 day, I love you.Ok, so food wise, I judge it based on my value per $ spent. This place allowed me to purchase a pizza for $5 and an extra $ for pepperoni. My expectation was gas station pizza. I was wrong. For $6 dollars I got a pretty darn decent pizza. There's no way to beat this price.Do not come here expecting gourmet or even good/great pizza. Come here expecting a good $5 pizza or $6 if you ask for a topping. Pair it with a bud light like I did and you have a winner.P.S - I'm going to Milan tomorrow, so let's see how this compares. Ciao"
"Just when we we were about to give up on finding a good place to eat, we stumbled upon this one!Amazing food and wonderful service. The guy who works there was very lovely, we were fasting for Ramadan and he was as well. He took good care of us and brought us dates.We ordered chicken vindaloo, samosa, chicken cha.ag (maybe wrong spelling), and butter naan, it was all yummy!.Disgusting. Ordered delivery. Chicken Tikka, Alloo mottar gobi, veg samosa. All inedible. Chicken was so over cooked and dry with no flavor. ALG tasted rancid. Stopped eating out of concern for food safety.  Samosa greasy and flavorless. Tossed in the garbage..The food was great, the staff are some of the kindest I've seen....I was son lucky to stumble upon this gem on 86th st.I have ordered from here several times ! Always delicious ! ITS BEEN A MOMENT SINCE I ORDERED. Today guys this food is so tasty ..even the condiments taste splendidly. It taste better . I got the chicken vindaloo (I love spice) it was so fresh and simply taste better ..it's always on point ..but there is a delightful change ..it's in my neighborhood ; it's affordable n I do recommend.I only post 5 stars when both customer service is great as well as food ! There food is nothiibg short but amazing ..now I ordered this during the covid-19 and it was amazing ..piping hot at my door . The gentleman who answers the phooey is delectable as the food . Very patient and courteous. You really can't ask for nothing else ..during these trying times anyone you can get to just place a smile on your face is nothing short but grateful. I have the Goat Vindaloo (very spicy) as it's made . It was delicious ..not salty ..but packed with so much flavor ..and herbs ..it danced ...order ; order ; order ..I'm pretty sure you WILL NOT be disappointed.I've lived in this neighborhood for over 30 years and have walked past Indian Tanpura many times.  Well, tonight I was craving Indian cuisine and boy was I lucky to get off the subway at 86th Street.This place is the real deal.Do not expect a fancy place for tourists so much as a very small (mostly take-out) place for locals.The server could not be more gracious and welcoming.  The only other patrons inside the restaurant were a local big mouth and two flight attendants, in the know, from Air France.I was craving Chicken Vindeloo.  The server asked me if I wanted it prepared Indian style or mild.  Well, this dish is not for the timid.  It's as hot (spicy) as the sun on the Ganges in summer.  I loved it with the basmati rice and a little bit of bread (poori). It is deep fried but light and fluffy.  Authentic.I was able to make two meals out of the dinner and I left  the restaurant like a fire-breathing dragon.  Do not be discouraged by this.  There are mild and flavorful dishes on the menu.When you are visiting the UWS and having a hunger pang for Indian cuisine, this is a good choice.  I'll certainly return..Been going to this place and ordering takeout for years. It's the perfect neighborhood Indian spot. They have been 100% reliable every single time. The food is delicious and the staff is super friendly..Hands down, the best Indian food on the east coast. This is a huge claim, I know, but Indian Tanpura is absolutely brilliant when it comes to food selection, value, and atmosphere. The owner is an incredibly kind man who says hello every time we walk past the place. Their coconut curry, chicken curry, and chicken tikka masala is easily the best I've ever had. Their naan is also unparalleled. You should absolutely check this place out if you're on the UWS..Delicious Indian food and the owners are so kind!!!! A neighborhood gem and a great takeout spot.Favorite restaurant in the world. Everything is delicious and the service is always awesome. 11/10 would recommend..Love love love this place. We order take out from here all the time, and every time the food is fresh, flavorful and delicious. We especially love the biryani, chicken vindaloo (spicy!), samosas and dal. Tastes like home cooking in the best way -- deep flavors that soothe the soul. Highly recommend!"
"Ordered take out from this spot & it did not disappoint! The ramen, garlic broccoli, buns were all delicious. Portions were filling & prices were reasonable. The spring rolls weren't my fav but I think it just doesn't travel well. I would definitely order here again.The decor, and outdoor dining is beautiful. The restaurant looks very trendy. Sadly, the food was a disappointment. For appetizers we got:-seafood ceviche 3/10. The seafood was not fresh.  The octopus was watery. Barely taste the yuzu citrus. -popcorn chicken 6/10. Flavorless, gave bbq sauce as dipping. The portion was small.  For main entrée:Miso ramen and spicy miso udon. 5/10The broth was warm, watery, bland and only tasted salty. The bamboo shoot had no flavor. Both the udon noodles and Ramen noodles were under cook.The service was average nothing out of the ordinary..It's ok. It's not the most super authentic Japanese place. Actually the tonkotsu broth was horrible. It was so light and thin. I'm not saying non-Japanese people can't do ramen, but they definitely wouldn't let this stuff fly.I also got a spider roll and it tasted super fishy. I still ate it cause I'm cheap, but blegh.The pork was super tasty. I liked the toppings. The noodles were ok. Just fix the broth please. You can't be selling tonkotsu like that. It was more shio..OMG BEST SUSHI EVER. This food experience was amazing. We got pork dumplings, summer roll, and pork belly tonkotsu ramen.Everything was amazing. 10 stars out of 5. I can't wait to go back and try everything else. We each got ramen one with ramen noodle and one with udon and neither disappointed but to me the udon was the hit.Truly great food..It's the best place nearby. We love to come here.We usually ordered here hand rolls and sop for our baby. The food really fresh and tasty. We also ordered delivery and it's always in time.We love it here! My children love sushi and it's a great place to go with the nice outdoor seating especially during covid. We usually get some appetizers, rolls, and buns. They have all been delicious and I love the plum wine! Service is typically quick and we enjoy the atmosphere..This is get me sick! Food poison !!The old man waiter had a bad attitude!!Do not come here!!!I'm ok with bad attitude! But make me sick from eating your food is bad!!!I started to feel bad in the middle of my meal, and that was my first meal of the day!! Old man said it was me! You know what? F U and F your restaurant!Ever again!.Besides the name change, if a business' menu, food preparation, and management has changed so much, it really is no longer the same business, and reviews for it's former version should not be allowed to carry over. When I wrote my first review almost two years ago, it was for Dashi Noodle House. Though my opinion on the food wasn't high, I felt they had potential. As Jin Ramen, it has only gotten worse. I haven't been back since my last review, and today, I walked into a completely different restaurant. Menu is completely different:It is a larger menu and has happy hour specials. I felt good about this...at first. When I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, I was asked what type of noodles I wanted. I'm at a ramen joint, so I said ""wavy"". No, my choices were ramen or udon. I should have seen that as a red flag.Food recipes and preparation is different:My order came and I immediately noticed the difference in the pork slices. Previously, they served round cuts of char siu pork. Now they serve theses dry slices of pork belly that are missing the distinct layers of fat. They were mildly marinated and quite bland, though not nearly as bland as the ""tonkotsu"" broth, which may have been the blandest and most diluted version of pork bone broth I've ever had. Not rich. Not flavorful. Not reconizable as tonkotso. My ramen...a slab of mushy, straight noodles that somehow added to the blandness of the dish. Ya'll...I added soy sauce to my ramen! That, along with two types of hot sauce that got dumped in the broth, made it mildly tolerable. Another thing to note since I mentioned it on my original review, Dashi's Shoyu Ramen was made of duck broth and Jin's is made of chicken. So this is a completely different menu. Management stlye is different:No longer a tip-free restaurant, which suggests to me that wages were lowered for the servers and they are back to relying on tips for wages. I did have excellent service. My server was super attentive. When I asked for hot sauce, he brought me chili oil, as well as asking the kitchen for the hot sauce they put in the spicy miso ramen. Believe me, I needed both!On this day, the food was so bad (please see my 7/28/19 photos of their Tonkotsu Ramen), I can't even add a star of the good service..Reasons to LOVE this place:1) This is a 'no tipping' establishment, so I assume they pay their servers a living wage or at least, a reasonable wage.  2) Super friendly servers that are a pleasure to chat with. 3) In my area of Ridgewood, there are no other ramen joints within a one mile radius. I'd have to travel to Bushwick. Japanese and Korean spots that offer ramen on their menu don't count. I'm talking actual ramen joints where ramen is the star. For all of these wonderful reasons to love this place, I wish I could actually say I love this place. Went for the shoyu ramen on the first try. It was mild, but the duck-based broth was very tasty. Wavy noodles were a bit thinner than how I like them. Soft boiled eggs either needed more marination time or a better marinade. It was flavorless. I do like their Chasu pork. It was cut thick, it was juicy, and it had the perfect ratio of meat-to-fat. I needed to come back before attempting a review. On my second visit, I had the spicy miso ramen and as an appetizer, simmered pork with seaweed. The ramen was not spicy at all and extremely bland. While I do like the lower salt content, I don't want to sacrifice flavor. Salt aside, it was missing the infamous UMAMI! I requested for more miso paste to add flavor to the broth and was given more broth instead. I accepted it, not wanting to make a fuss. Same opinion as above in regards to noodles and egg. The appetizer was bland, too. Sauce was good, but the simmered pork was dry and completely tasteless. The delicate sauce was not absorbed into the meat, not strong enough to flavor the meat, nor thick enough to coat the meat. (School me, Yelpers, is that how this dish is supposed to taste? Just unmarinated, unseasoned meat with sauce added only after it had been fully cooked?)Maybe it was a bad night, I don't know. I will likely come back since I don't have much of a selection in the area, but I do hope they improve on their bowls. I'm not impressed. Two stars on food. Extra star for solid, friendly service..Saw the sign of a bowl with noodles. We said let's get noodles . Really cute set up with Covid. Food came quick was delicious. But they should work on their customer service. Barely saw our server and hard to find at times . I don't know if it's the outside set up that it makes it hard for you to see the customers but we're there waiting . Anyhow great noodles.Hands down one of my favorite places for authentic Japanese food! I absolutely love everything about this place: the food, the staff, the whole vibe!! Truly my top go to restaurant. Keep up the great work."
"This is my Fav sushi spot. I always order salmon don. Portions of salmon aren't always consistent but still good..This is place is super yummy! I ordered through door dash to get food from here, and I'm glad I did. Never be afraid to try new places, without any reviews or else you'll miss out on a gem like this one!We ordered the tonkotsu ramen with regular ramen noodles and one with udon noodles. The soup came well packaged: one big bowl that contained the broth and then within that bowl they had a smaller bowl sitting on top with the dry contents. Lots of soup places to do this from the noodles getting soggy while in transport. The broth was favorable and the chasu pieces were thick! I'm glad they didn't skimp out on the meat. Both noodles were perfectly cooked too.We also ordered the hibachi shrimp which was nicely peppered and grilled to perfection. I definitely have to try their sushi and other dishes they have to offer!"
"I haven't gotten cheap Chinese takeout for a looong time. This place has a full dinner for $8.80+tax ($9.60 total), with $10 credit card minimum. Having lived in LA and SF, I haven't seen takeout meals this cheap in a while (excluding Costco food court and grocery stores).For the daily special, each entree comes with a side and rice base (white, brown, fried, pork fried).The food was ready in about 10 minutes and was very warm and heartwarming.General Tso's Chicken -- solid chicken, with sauce I found slightly over sweet.Hot and sour soup -- came in a warm plastic container. good thicknessBrown rice -- solid.Ambience - 3/5 -- Pretty ghetto outdoor area, with lots of graffiti on adjacent venues' doors and windows. Inside: good arrangement for takeout with no tables, with stack of boxes in a corner which unintentionally doubles as a table haha. Three staff in the kitchen behind ordering screen. Ordering counter is clean and stack of menus is neat and clear.Quality - 4/5 -- Warm, otherwise standard, Chinese takeout. Nothing to note, I was nostalgic and happy.Service  - 5/5 -- The two staff I talked to are fluent in both English and Mandarin Chinese, and it was fun chatting with them in both when ordering. Food came super quickly. Value - 5/5 -- $10 full meal in the form of cheap chinese takeout beats most substantive restaurants, stands, and food trucks..So. today I wanted to get some Chinese food and I was really not trying to push myself about getting Chinese food here in New York City. Not very good from my last experience here where I was food poison. So, a number of problems happen here, 1) trying to get in the restaurant was a pain with one door for entry and exit with luggage -  2) there was a guest claiming he order food from 2 nights ago and has been asking from what I was hearing about a return or an order here never received. When it came time for me to order I'd asked for D1 which was the daily special with Tofu. My order took 17 minutes and 33 seconds to cook up when I was told it will take 5 minutes. Many customers came and went and I was still in the shop waiting for my food. When I received my food, I was never shown what it look like or how it was prepared. Now once at a safe place to eat it, I never send tofu the way it was prepared. It didn't taste like tofu and didn't look like tofu at all. At first, it looked like shrimp and I was hoping it was until taking my first bite and my brain and stomach will not identify the food at all. This is what reminds me back in China that they will use all types of other ingredients (things you should not pull in your body) I don't think that was even tofu, to be honest with you. I have never seen tofu mash and prepared like that before. Normal tofu is cubes cut in squares or slices with a sauce and raw but this, hmm. This is why I don't like fake Chinese American food at all. It's fast food at its worst. The rice was ok but my stomach didn't like the tofu, so I stop eating it, and then I was in the Moynihan Train Hall using the bathroom throwing up the food. The Moynihan security called the EMT and I went to the nearby hospital where it wasn't food poison but my body rejected the food. Something was in that tofu or fake tofu that make my body reject it fast. I never went back to the location because they are most likely are not going to refund me my funds. That is just American Chinese business in NYC for you. If you New Yorkers think that is good Chinese food then you have never gone to a real Chinese restaurant before in your lifetime. Please beware my experience may differ from your experience but this is not real Chinese food. But then again, it's also my fault for not just going to Chinatown in lower manhattan and getting something to eat before boarding a train that I miss because of this. Lucky for me, I was able to reschedule the ticket due to hospital clarification.Do not eat here, it wasn't the best and it's right next to Moynihan Train hall too, so beware..I found a Roach  in my rice. So disgusting!!!!!!!!!!!! This place needs to shut down immediately.good portions, good service. Food is standard Chinese takeout foodThe block is a little rough but the inside felt fine while I waited for my takeout.it's fire, best spot in the city for take out of course. they're always on time, never late. food is always good!.This restaurant is fantastic. Food is delicious and reasonably priced. Service is fast and friendly. Only gripe is that there is no sit-down table service, but that's it..Was looking for a place for good Chinese takeout that was close to where I lived, and this place was definitely the right choice. I ordered online for pickup and got there in around 10 minutes and my food was ready for me. They have a great after 4pm deal where you get the perfect portion size with your choice of regular or fried rice and the choice between a few appetizers for an amazing price. Definitely not the fanciest place, but I find those to have the best food..Got delivery, it was good! The rice was fluffy and chicken tasted like many other general's chickens. Basic but satisfying. 3/5 stars because of the price. The serving was not enough for a $20 entree..Very good inexpensive food they deliver quick and the food isn't greasy not sure if it's a new location that opened but they are very good their pork fried rice is delicious and the boneless ribs are cooked with just enough sauce.Terrible blame this is not Chinese take out style chicken and broccoli.... the chicken is dry and no flavor and the broccoli is soggy and not fresh."
"Wow, after an indeterminate amount of, but I'm sure long, time, Dinersty has finally shut it's doors. It will be missed on those nights when you're staggering home after a long and fuzzy night ou.....hey waitaminute, what's that down the street? OMG a chinese take out joint called Dynasty??!  With the same cooks and workers?!?! Seeing that sign outside my window daily, I've always had my suspicions about the intention of the spelling, and they've been validated. As far as the food goes, well, same age old NYC chinese takeout. If you're not expecting much you won't be disappointed. It serves it's purpose and I've never gotten sick from the food at this particular joint. I think that speaks volumes. Of course this is about the old Dinersty. The new place probably won't be any different when it opens in a few short weeks. The same stuff I grew up with, the same stuff you'll find in pretty much every borough, even the same pictures on the wall...it is what it is....There isn't much to be said about Dinersty that hasn't already been covered.  In all honesty, I was browsing through Chinese listings in this general area and I had to stop and chuckle when I saw this name.Chelsea was my old stomping ground from 9 years old into my early teens and I have so many twisted memories of this place.  So yes, I admit I haven't been here in quite some time but they are still consistent in what they do.  Piles of cheap, greasy food that I'm thinking would've made good drunk/hangover food if I were old enough to drink at the time.  It's open really late and I can't speak for all of the food.  At the time, I was a pescatarian, so I basically stayed with the vegetable dishes (didn't trust the shrimp). I remember pigging out on string beans or broccoli as part of their $4 lunch special (yes, I'm getting old), and the ""colorful"" characters that would show up.  There was a hard on his luck guy who would always come in and ask for ""white rice with gwaby"".  I remember giving him a couple of dollars because a meal like that from a place like this is just depressing..Damn, more than a year since the most trashiest Chinese joint in NYC has gotten reviewed?It's legit plain Chinese fast food, the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of Chinese food, whether it be Chicken & Broccoli, Moo Shu, Fried Chicken Wings with Pork Fried Rice, they serve it, and they serve it it in the most greasy way you can think of.Not necessarily a bad thing of course, it's supposed to be greasy, that's the point, but there's a line between good greasy and.... nauseatingly greasy.It comes & goes, it's like playing a slot machine. 1 out of 3 meals it'll be delicious, and the other 2 tend to be ""eh"" & isn't what it should be which is the downfall of Dinersty, that their odds play against themselves.If anything, you should walk over to 9th Ave & 34th Street to Golden City Chinese Restaurant, they cook everything right, but this review is about Dinersty.Dinersty has been here for a while, and it's low low prices and good portions of food is here to stay & definitely will fill your stomach and keep your wallet filled as well..First off, this is trashy New York City style Chinese food through and through. This isn't a place you bring anybody else. Hell, this isn't a place you sit in yourself necessarily. I did once and was eating with homeless people who scraped up enough change for a lunch special. You take out/get delivery.It's greasy, quick, filling Chinese food. It's like my guilty pleasure. Not to mention, it has maybe the most amazing name ever. So clever.They're also open till like 3 in the morning, which is very important to people like me..Oh buddy. What can I say about Dinersty? They deliver ALL night! Super cheap and greasy Chinese food in the middle of the night...what's not to love? Well, if I'm not desperately starving or hammered out of my mind, Dinersty actually isn't that awesome.The meat is a little questionable, and there's a ton of oil in the food. I literally have to slather on hot sauce to mask the dirtiness. Nonetheless, they're open to 3am. What a love/hate relationship..TrashI work in Penn Station and my fellow co-workers go here for some cheap food.You definitely get what you pay for. The place is filthy and the bums hang out in the place...at least that's what the clientele look like. The rice is dry, the pork looks old and chewy and the chicken can not be chicken, probably more like cat or dog. Avoid this place and keep walking two blocks to Home on 8th for some real Chinese food..I love to come here for greasy, American-style Chinese food.  I'm sure every Chinese restauranteur holds some contempt for Americans who always order the General Tso's, but Dinersty does not judge me..i'm kinda a big fan of chinese take-out in new york. my standard is quite low so is the price. sure every chinese take-out joint gives a big portion, so i normally can finish it because it's usually delicious. but i could not finish the food from here. big portion, low price, bad flavor...A stockpile of food for 5 bucks. Chicken with broccoli is great, but stay away from sesame. The tables are always packed at lunchtime, but I don't stay there anyway."
"I have to admit, Dunkin' was certainly exceptional. Dunkin' has an overall great vibe and a fun crowd that hangs there. Everything we purchased was awesome and the menu itself was to die for. I became very good friends with the staff, who are all awesome and super welcoming. Try this place out you won't regret it!.I don't understand why the customer service has to differ so drastically from ""black neighborhoods"" to ""less black neighborhoods"". Look at this sandwich. Why not switch the bagel out if you knew you screwed it up? The top part of the bagel was so thick that only the top layer was warm and toasted. The middle of the bagel was hard and cold while the other side was as thin as a chip and barely there. Needless to say the entire bagel had to be thrown out. This is the second time I've been to this location. The first time last winter, I asked for two donuts and the guy while coughing and sneezing puts it in the bag, never turned his head or even tried to cover his mouth with his arm or anything. Just handed me the bag he just coughed all over. I said I was done on that first visit gave it another shot and this happens. I'm not asking for five star customer service I know it's only Dunkin' Donuts but come on. I'm paying. Serve me edible food."
"I was looking to file my files and stumbled across this firm in Flushing. I gave them my paperwork, W-2's and whatnot and was told to come back the next day with additional paperwork. At a fee of $120, it was expensive but I was filing last minute so it was reasonable. I put down a deposit of $60.I came back the next day at noon. The woman who was suppose to take care of me, Holly Xu, was very stressed. I had my additional paperwork in an electronic file and asked if I could email it to her and she begins telling me that she is not accepting any emails today, and then goes on to say that she is not taking any new customers. I tell her that it's the last day to file taxes and I already gave her a deposit, where was all this yesterday? She then talks to Alice Chen and they raise the fee to $200 if I wanted to get my taxes taken care of her. That is ridiculous, as a business owner, how do you put your customers in a position like this? The people here are rude, predatory, and highly unprofessional. Unless you enjoy getting yelled at and overcharged, take your business elsewhere..Really one of the worst, the CPA herself doesn't do anything , hire a lot people's with bad service and you don't get to talk to CPA herself. And have bunch of different people do your tax. I feel extremelly un-comfortable the whole process , for setting up my LLC to doing tax I talked to at least 5 new people and you never see cpa herself..I've been going for years and this girl she is new sits at table 4, charged how ever much she want and they just keep adding on from previous year.i went from 5/6 w2 forms last year  to 2 this year and she charged $5 more (it only five I know-but its the principle -and not getting ripped off)so I said to her that doesn't make sense if I don't have as much w2 but yet you're charging more/ regardless of the fact they don't do a good job with taxs I've been getting ripped off . I have Taken my business else where and what a tremendous difference it has made everything about that place is so wrong. just be cautious on what they charge you each year / they also don't help or explain much either..I've been going for years and this girl she is new sits at table 4, charged how ever much she want and they just keep adding on from previous year.i went from 5/6 w2 forms last year  to 2 this year and she charged $5 more (it only five I know-but its the principle -and not getting ripped off)so I said to her that doesn't make sense if I don't have as much w2 but yet you're charging more/ regardless of the fact they don't do a good job with taxs I've been getting ripped off .

"I have been coming to this Boston Market for a few years now and have never been dissapointed. The food here is great and about as close to homemade as you can get from a chain restaurant. What puts this place over the top though is the service, it is exemplary and a model of what other places should aim for. Not only is the staff friendly, they are helpful and do all they can to accommodate your needs, wants and issues..Poor leadership. My first place I visited was Boston Market when I moved to the Bronx and for me at that time Food was delicious but OMGThis place is going down hill Cont' reading pleaseI've had seen many employees/managers come n' go from Boston Market, but this time oh I had enough on 8/23/2021 around 9pm we went to Boston Market and when I walked in the Manager was sitting with another employee in the left hand side; the manager get up and right on that moment somebody call her on her cellphone, she was loud and on top of that she told whoever she was talking to ( Didn't I told she's going to get fired, she was laughing), for me it went like wow! A person should never be happy when a person gets fired regardless of what they did because what goes around comes around plus that person will face financial instabilities if it doesn't know how to manage her/his money... okay I went to placed an order and the girl who also was taking drive-thru orders took mine. My order was meal for six 2 whole chicken dark meat only and this girl kept saying ""2 whole chicken and I keep repeating DARK MEAT ONLY! Please"" The manager step forward and asked me etc. The manager took the place of the guy who cuts the chicken to cut mine; she did a horrible job‍ my pictures will talk! My 6 sides were a nightmare 2 of the tray were almost empty and this girl serving whatever they have left until the point that I said ""could you please pour more and request more mashed potatoes and mac' cheese.....if you asks me to recommend Boston Market the answer is NO..I went to get the Rostesssiere chicken for our Thanksgiving Dinner and it was good service went good too. Much better than years ago.The only thing that I didn't like is the young ladies serving the food they talk on top of the customers plate while they pouring the food, I think that they can wear a mouth mask..3 meals. The market bowl came in a 3 compartment tray with chicken that was dry and looked chewed. The rice and spinach also terrible. The mac and cheese was soggy. Chicken was salty. I haven't ate here in years. Now I remember why. Gross and waste of money..Took the time out to order some dinner from Boston market , out of my order they never send me the turkey that was suppose to come with my 2 meat combo , ( the whole reason why i ordered it to begin with ) my bf had mash with no gravy what so ever ! , for 53$ i expected better since i always go here when i want something healthy to eat ! What a disappointment tried to call the store 10 times phone just kept ringing wanted a price adjustment or just to get the things sent back to me that i paid for which were missing !  Wont be ordering from here anymore! , i work in the food industry and everyone makes mistakes but at least pick up the phone to make things right !!!!!!Btw : And send us our food with no utensils AT ALL !!!.So my mother n I went to this particular location for lunch after the young lady at the counter brought our food to the register she informed us exact cash or credit or debit card . We ordered the garlic herb n chicken ,I observed when they took our orders to the back n placed the garlic n sauce on top which tasted like nothing . I asked for a drink they only have one large size no ice at the ice machine u have to ask the young lady for ice . Oh I forgot to mention the chicken was over cooked n very dry the wing part was burnt. The total amount for both meals. Was about $27.00 which I feel I actually wasted . I doubt I would return to any other Boston market.Placed an order at 11am for pick up for 5:30 pm. I showed up at 5pm to see if i could pick up my order a little earlier. My order was already ready and bagged up. We had ordered almost 90 dollars worth of food that was supposed to feed 6 people, but what we received was enough for maybe 3. I had to go back in and order more sides and desserts. Then when we got into the car we noticed all the food was ice cold. My theory? They made the food at 11 am and had it sitting in a cold dark spot for almost 6 hours. I took one bite of each side and my stomach started to turn. I ended up getting sick!!! NEVER ORDERING FROM THEM AGAIN! Absolutely disgusting!!.I love ordering from here. I love the portions, the chicken is always made to perfection and juicy. The sides are yummy. My favorite though is the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. The corn is great and sweet. I don't know where they get the corn, but the service sweetest corn. Now if only they have spices like red pepper. Otherwise, great food.I have purchased from them many times but when i called to place an order on west Broad Street in Columbus, Ohio they were ""TOO BUSY"" to take my $65 order. While I realize these are difficult times, my guess is Boston Market no longer values my business. With so many other places to purchase fresh rotisserie chicken, I am certain I can find someone to appreciate my business!! I can and WILL take my money elsewhere!!.Boston market used to be my all time favorite. Even though it was fast food it still tasted like a home cooked meal. But not anymore !!! I don't know if the recipes changed or they switched out to using cheaper ingredients but it's so bland and nasty now. First off my family meal came to $82. The food tasted like it was frozen and they just heated it up. The creamed spinach which was one of my favorites was cold in the middle and no longer even tastes creamy. The sweet potato casserole didn't have any marshmallows or oat crumbs and was very watery. The mac and cheese also tasted watery and way overcooked. The roasted potatoes weren't even all the way cooked or microwaved some of them were still raw. The croutons in the chicken salad tasted stale. Honestly the only thing that was good in the whole meal was the corn bread. And now after an $82 bill and a 2 hour wait for delivery my family is still hungry. Probably the last time I will order from you guys again.Food was ok. However the management sucks. It was hot two days ago, got there and placed my order. Now the manager assigned a newbie to the cash register. He himself is serving the food. There's a lot of people waiting to order. He took a bunch of patrons order but the new girl was so slow the food literally sat there for almost 10 minutes getting cold. He had other guys in the back, being a manager he should have called extra help to not have 11 customers standing there watching their food get cold in front of them."
"Holy moly!My train leaves in 5 minutes and I need a giant cup of coffee so I can be alert enough for the next four hours back to Boston to bang out some work n my trusty laptop.Enter the convenience, competence and efficiency of Primo Cappucino in Penn Station. Located a hop, skip and a jump away from the tracking board, I was able to monitor my train's track number announcement while getting an iced latte. With three  minutes to go, I was on my way to to the train, latte and bottle water in hand. A smile on my face, too. The counter gal was really friendly and made our order with the quickness. Large latte, large cappucino and a large bottle water: $14. I paid the price of convenience. I am okay with that!.I've never received less cream cheese on a bagel in my life.  Thick bagel with maybe a teaspoon of cream cheese.  Not the place to save money, Primo..Fresh & delicious ready-made sandwiches and wraps, great freshly brewed coffee, sweet and gooey dessert bars, and super-friendly staff. And they sell Deep River potato chips, THE best chips you'll ever have. I always grab something here before boarding Amtrak for Upstate NY. Find Primo on the south side of the Amtrak Passenger Waiting Area / Lounge near gates 5/6 East..This little place inside Penn Station has detiriorated somewhat in the last few years. I used to like stopping in while waiting for a train to enjoy a nice coffee and a baked goodie while reading the paper. It was a pretty cool place with a nice low key seating area in the back with armchairs and sidetables. I liked the kitschy pictures on the walls that were of people in the 1950's enjoying coffee.That was then, this is now. I stopped by today to have a smoothie. The mango smoothie I got was pretty good. My problem with this place isn't the food, although it is disappointing they don't actually make anything there other than coffee drinks and smoothies. I think they used to.They never have but one person working and they never seem to be busy. As I sat for a little bit today, I figured out why. It looks run down and worn. The cushy armchairs and old and ripped, the tables were dirty, and the carpet looked decades removed from a good cleaning. The place looks like the owner doesn't care about the appearance. To me that's sad and ridiculous, considering the amount of foot traffic in Penn Station.There are plenty of places inside Penn to get coffee and baked goods. Hot & Crusty and Le Bon Pain are pretty good for that, but their seating areas are boring and tiny. Primo's used to be unique and inviting. It seems as if they simply gave up.My suggestion, spruce the place up. Get some new furniture. Patch the holes in the walls, get some fresh paint. Keep the kitshy pictures, I love those. But remake it to feel like the ambiance of those pictures. Hire some part time people to make it look inviting. Having one person by themselves behind the counter but nobody cleaning the eating areas, is just stupid.I bet they could increase their sales alot if they simply invested in a fresh look, some different and unique food items, and some cheer in the place. Until they do, I will miss the way it was when it was nice..Oh, for shame!I ask for a small cappuccino.  $4.50---good thing they take cards because I was not prepared!  Smallest beverage option starts at $4.50?  Of course everybody is running late so we all bite the bullet.Beverage comes to me 30 seconds later, three times the size of a normal cappuccino which might make some customers happy (somehow thinking this is a bargain)...but its basically regular drip coffee with a thin layer of milk bubbles on top.  Wheres the creamy foam?  Or even some crappy airy foam?  And what about that sexy balance, the proportion of shot to milk?  At least the flavor of the coffee was not bitter (needed no sugar).  They have misrepresented a classic coffee creation and I am unforgiving..Meh.  It's OK.  You can grab a cappucino here on the way to work from  Penn Station - but it's just OK and way too expensive.  There are better coffee spots nearby.  The deli next door has better food - that's for sure!.Great for a candy bar or a soft drink. Despite their name, Primo Cappuccino, they don't know how to make cappuccinos at all. I ordered one, assuming it would be better than say Dunkin Donuts; however, not only was it terrible, but it was also lukewarm at best! Again, great for a candy bar or soft drinks, unacceptable for just about anything else..Got to Penn station so early that Dunkin Donuts wasn't even open yet.  But this place was.  They have bagel w/ cream cheese & coffee for $2.95!  They also had great selection of pastries & fresh fruit."
"They sell good pre-packaged black & white cookies. I'm telling you, if you want this type of cookie to ""save"" get the pre packaged ones. They stay fresh for several days....versus buying a non-packaged (albeit fresher one at that time) cookie. Really really bad soft stale pretzels.What do you do when the service is great, but the product is horrible? I guess two stars is the happy medium.I needed to snag something to eat before hopping onto an Amtrak headed to Boston because an overpriced Penn Station sandwich was still cheaper than the dining car.Primo was next to the waiting area with decent looking food. You could get a sandwich with chips and a pickle. Sounded like a nice little meal deal. I chose a chipotle chicken sandwich and went on my way.A couple of hours later on the train I got a little peckish. Upon opening the box they put everything in, I immediately noticed that the pickle was missing. Crap. That would've been a nice treat. The sandwich ended up being less an edible substance and more akin to a jaw exercise. After muscling through the hardened bread with its tough chicken, I could've bit through a steel cable. Or pulled a fire truck using only my jaw. Seriously, it was a difficult sandwich to eat. The chips were meh. Utz doesn't exactly light my fire. So in summation - missing pickle, almost inedible sandwich, and meh chips.At this point, I think 2 stars is generous, but the ladies behind the counter were friendly and quick, so they deserve some recognition.Personally, I would skip this place and try *literally* any other food vendor..Was just in there to buy something. 3 employees 3 chin straps. No one can wear a mask correctly. I left, sad because they have nice items, expensive but that's all over Penn station.Primo cappuccino is a good option for a quick stop for breakfast, lunch or coffee. The place offers ready made or made to order breakfast and sandwiches. They have limited seating but since the crowd is always moving, you can always find a spot..Located in Penn Station, this place can be convenient if you are in a rush and looking for a quick bite as they have some premade food items. I got an iced coffee and was disappointed when I saw him just get it from a machine, i dont think they make it themselves, but probably just get it from a grocery store. He handed me the cup and pointed to where I could add cream and sugar. The coffee wasn't amazing, it didn't taste that good even with the cream and sugar added. Since this place lacked authenticity, at least in the coffee, I wouldn't come back just for the coffee, but maybe their other items if I'm in a rush at Penn."
"This was my first visit to Primo! Cappuccino. It was a Saturday at 12:30pm. I ordered the Chipotle Chicken sandwich which they quickly prepared. Some light fun banter among employees made my visit delightful. There was nothing special but it was a good, quick meal worth the $9..Bought a juice for $7. Watched girl use her bare hands to Handel fruit, on dirty cutting board and not wash her hands.  Walked out wo taking the juice, and didn't ask for a refund. Then Went to smoothie king in LIRR, down steps by bathrooms. It was so professional there..Great place to get coffee and some food before boarding train.  I like their cookies and bakery items. Some people come in for the sandwiches.  Clean nice service..Over a dollar for almond milk? Go F yourself. It's not a premium item.Those of us who cannot stand when little things are turned into grand endeavors for no reason whatsoever will regret walking in.In spite of loud air ducts and music playing, I was whispered to by two employees. Learn to speak up! I guarantee they know how to be loud when hanging out with friends. With me, the only customer in the place? Self-conscious whispering. For ordering a plain small coffee. Unreal.You know who doesn't have a problem with volume, though? The employee on break who was loudly - and most painfully to the ears - singing along to Lauryn Hill.Getting the almond milk added to my coffee was a big old to-do as well. In what was like a silent movie - lips were moving, but I heard nothing - the girl whipped up the almond milk and put it in my drink. I would have been happier to plop some into my drink myself without all that fuss. Is this to justify a 2.20 coffee suddenly becoming 3.50 - and after I had already handed over my debit card, I might add?As soon as you ever walk into a Primo Cappucino location they always swarm all over you like you're a vulnerable gazelle and they're piranhas in the water as you wade in. They don't even give you a chance to read or look at anything. They stare at you with blank, soulless expressions, and when they do talk, they do so in a way that you can't possibly hear them. It's needlessly inefficient...in a train station no less, where many customers are in a hurry.Nobody seems to know what customer service is anymore. It shouldn't only be available at a restaurant where entrees are upwards of 25 dollars.  Just a modicum of common sense would do so much good..This was my first and last time here.  The customer ahead of me asked for a small cup of water. ""No im sorry"".   Customer said we just need a sip to take medication.  ""Another staffer said no you has to buy water"".   So he commented about that being illegal especially cause it's for a child.   She shrugged.    I commented on how sad that was.   And asked if they could use a little humanity.   She shrugged again and saw my phone and said ""you can't take photos of staff!"" So I asked for a manager.  She sent me on a wild goose chase to another store at Penn station.   Instead I will call and email their HQ office in NYC next week.   That one employee attitude cost them three sales in 3 minutes.  And IT could have been averted for one little cup of water.  This is why NYC has a lousy reputation..My latte went straight into the garbage can, once I tasted the coffee.These people are totally incompetent at making espresso. I suppose they must use Maxwell House or Farmer Brothers beans, the stuff is total dreck. It's a sad situation when a mass-chain (Starbucks) option would be like a gourmet extravaganza compared to the local-boy disaster.Can we please have someone who knows how to make espresso drinks in the Amtrak waiting area??.While Primo Cappuccino's espresso drinks are rather expensive and mediocre, it provides decent snack, beverage, and food options for travelers on the go -- all the more, since Primo has two venues about 500 feet apart (a coffee stand and a coffee shop with more food and snacks). Judging by the ubiquity of yellow Primo coffee cups scattered among morning commuters (which piqued my curiosity), Primo's strategy seems to be working well..Ice cold beer in a wino  bag while you wait for your train..They take your money, but don't serve what you pay for. I ordered a cup of coffee and was charged $6. Cappuccino is anything, but a cappuccino. Yes, you read that right. Bad business and whoever operates it is not ethical. Cashier had an attitude also. Avoid at all cost..Similar to a review below. Said my card was not working, so I paid with cash. Turns out, my card did work so I paid twice. Scum bags operate this place, everyone's traveling so there is no recourse. They know there is only so much length people will go for $10, so they get away with stealing."
"I had the pleasure of coming back for a second visit with more friends. Let me start off by saying the bartender will treat you well! My friend arrived earlier than us by 20 mins and her ""mai tai"" was well poured. It wasn't exactly a Mai tai. But she enjoyed it. We were offered a brunch social. Good music. Super friendly staff The good: the bottomless drinks are tasty! The Bellinis are really good and not like other places that barely place Prosecco unless you request more. Everyone at the table isn't required to do bottomless in order for the group to have bottomless. Wide array of brunch options. Table tried: steak and eggs, French toast, huevos rancheros with side of steak, fried chicken sandwich. Some options required an additional fee on top of brunch prefix. Overall, everyone enjoyed there meals. Huevos rancheros we're okay but not the best I've ever had..I stumbled upon this place whilst looking for brunch. I wasn't disappointed. Really great price for brunch prefix. $38 with 2 hours bottomless and entree under $18. Anything more, you'd add the difference. I will say, the menu options for brunch are hit or miss. My friends and I enjoyed our options. STEAK & EGGS 23.506 oz. strip loin, skillet eggs, breakfast potatoes,SOUTHERN FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH 19.50sausage gravy, smoked bacon, homemade biscuit, fried egg, breakfast potatoesEGG SANDWICH 18.00 cheddar, avocado, turkey bacon, BBQ aioli, english muffin, hand cut friesEasily booked on line for last minute reservation for Saturday brunch. Will be back!.Great place for bottomless brunch. Came in to a full dining room that was a tad too noisy for our preference. But the servers continued to hustle and brought out steak and eggs out quickly.The steak was cooked perfectly to temperature. The country fries tasty, and the eggs really awesome. They even had grated horseradish for our steaks.Thank you Elvis for running a tight front of house on a busy Sunday morning.I couldn't be more grateful to have celebrated our 25th birthday at Pennsylvania 6. My sister and I were in contact with Nicole, who made the whole planning process super simple. We had about 27 guests attend with a 2 hour optional open bar package, which was very convenient considering we had some guest who do not drink. She was also able to be in great communication with one of our friends to decorate the area with balloons, signs and confetti, which was a wonderful surprise. At the end of the night we were given sparklers and champagne which was a great way to end our celebration. Jake the bartender was super friendly to everyone and made us feel greatly attended to! Overall, wish we could do the night again and can't wait to visit in the future..Came here for a private event. Sorry, no pictures. We were served cocktail hour style with servers bringing different apps/tapas around. Food that went around was grilled chicken with bbq sauce, tuna tartare, sliders, Burrata, sliders, pepperoni pizza and margarita pizza. My favorite was the tuna tartare!! Delicious and fresh. It was served with mango on a plantain. It was better than sushi grade tuna.Second would be Burrata. It was served with some bread and bruschetta. Pizza. The pepperoni pizza was very yummy and had a sweetness to it. The margarita pizza was good as well. I didn't care for the grilled chicken. It was basic grilled chicken and the bbq sauce tasted like it came from a container. I don't need red meat, so I can't comment on the sliders but they looked yummy. Service was great! The servers made sure got something! Bartenders were good as well. My boyfriend and I are planning on coming back for dinner!.Definitely one of the nicer sports bars in the Midtown area. It's brisk walk to Madison square Garden if you're going to a show or catching a basketball game. A great place to pre or post game and even grab a meal. The kitchen does really good work and the services is very quick without lacking of quality. Bartenders know their craft and take care of you.They do require you to show your card before you take a seat. During the weekends it's probably the best bet to make a reservation if you plan on getting a table. This is a Buffalo bills backer bar and gets hectic on the Sunday when they play and it's usually a lot of fun as well..They give you a comment card with your check so here are my answers: This was my first time in, I am a nyc resident. My favorite thing about my visit was the staff, they were very nice and squeaked us in without a reservation. I would change the wait for food, they were definitely understaffed. My compliments again would go to the staff who were all working their hardest. The food was fine. Good for a casual atmosphere but nice decor averaged priced meal..I have been here several times before the pandemic . This was the first time after the pandemic. The service was still okay with quick and observant waiters.But the quality of foods are not really same as it used to be.Lobster roll is a bit bland with cheap bread. A tad pricey for one roll with very little lobster.My cousin ordered veggies hotpot which was like a leftover rice mixed with curry.I didn't even bother to take the pic. Corn dip is the best among our orders.Drinks are just okay.And they have COVID 5% charge in additional to tax..I will think twice to come again..We stopped in for a bottomless brunch before attending the Knicks game since this restaurant is right around the corner from MSG. The bottomless brunch is $40 per person and includes 90 minutes of drinking plus an entree that is $18 or less. We each had round 5 mimosas so paying for bottomless brunch was worth it. The food was awesome as was the service. I'm so glad we made reservations because the restaurant got super busy shortly after we were seated. Overall it was a great experience..I've come here a few times for drinks and snacks. I usually sit outside, but given different temperatures and Weathers I've also started to sit inside now during Covid. They've done a good job of keeping tables separate. I also usually request quieter tables and they are able to comply. They have a lot of seating, a large amount of space at the bar and lots of smaller tables in two very large rooms. The wait staff usually knows what specials they have for the day and are very friendly and helpful. I usually think of this as an upscale bar with good service. I've tried the tacos as well as the I'll have another cocktail and the Manhattan 36. I also really like the Tuna sashimi on avocado which is really good and I would recommend getting that every time. I don't really recommend a lot of the vegetarian dishes except perhaps for the elote. The cauliflower is deep fried and over sweet but I did like the shishito peppers. I'll be back for sure, it's one of the better spots near Penn Station..My friends and I dropped in spontaneously on a Saturday afternoon. We were seated and served within 30 minutes. I got the steak and eggs. It was pretty aight. There was another party next to us and they were loud AF. Seriously, I've never heard laughter that was so high and ear-breaking in pitch. It was quite a bitch."
"I went to Leroy House three separate times over the span of seven days, this past summer--that's how much I enjoyed the food and my experience there. I would recommend dinner over brunch; over the countless times I've been for dinner, I have never been disappointed with any of the menu items--and I've tried them all!--with the duck being my absolute favourite. However, brunch left much to be desired, with my burger having been of good quality, but the french toast and waffles with fried chicken being a far cry from the quality that I'd come to expect from Leroy House. The service was fantastic with each experience, though--all of the servers have been so kind, and in one instance, my party and I had been sent next door to Lelabar for a round of drinks on the house just for having been asked to clear our table, when we would have completely understood, as restaurants need to turn tables! They also have a fantastic happy hour that includes light fare, as well--it's truly a gem in the neighbourhood..The food here was outstanding. We started with the burrata salad which was pleasantly different and refreshing. I'd never had burrata paired with cold butternut squash before - it really worked. Others at the table had the deviled eggs which looked fancy! I had the seared pork chop and it was thick and juicy. I don't order pork chops often because it's so easy to mess up but they did a great job here. My fiance had the crispy duck confit which I kept stealing bites of because it was so good. The steak and salmon were also a hit. Cocktails were solid, but maybe not as great as I would have expected given the high caliber of food served.The atmosphere is dark and intimate and the service was polite and attentive. We had a little mishap with seating - our reservation was for indoors, but we had received an email stating that they were only offering outdoor seating. When we arrived, we were seated outside, but noticed there was indeed indoor seating. Not a problem at all. Shortly after receiving drinks and ordering food, the hostess comes over and says she heard we were cold and offered to seat us inside (we did not complain about being cold, but nevertheless took her up on the offer. It was kind that they noticed we appeared chilly). I only bring this up because in the end, we agreed that it was much better that we enjoyed our meal inside instead of outside, especially because of the upscale nature of the food, prices, and atmosphere. This is not a casual restaurant. It was also impressive that there was no confusion with our orders even though we switched tables. Would recommend for special occasions and dates..One of the best restaurants I've been to in NYC. We went for an anniversary dinner and the prices were expensive, but the food was so delicious. Service - We were promptly seated for our reservation - Our waiter struck a good balance between coming to check on us and giving us our space Atmosphere - We sat on the patio, and the provided little candles for a nice candlelit ambiance - There's a decked seating area with fairy light decorations and heat lamps that looked very charming - Completely full place so seems like you definitely need a reservation Food - All the small bites looked really good so we just got a bunch of those to share. It was filling enough for the two of us- Deviled egg: presentation of the deviled egg was so beautiful and the dish was delicious. Came with little bits of roe on top for added texture - Eggplant dip came with soft pita as well as a labne - so beautiful - The crab gratin was cheesy, and the taste of the crab and the artichoke complemented each other beautifully. Came with a side of crispy chips - Seared meatballs: perfect mix of nice cheese sprinkled on top, generous tomato sauce, and basil (key). Will be back the next time we're in the city!.One of my favorite west village spots. Great vibes inside or outdoors. Ordered the fava bean salad that was more like a dip along with the potato chips. They fry the chips in clean oil at the beginning of the night so there's not cross contamination with gluten for anyone with an allergy. Whole menu has great GF options. The pork chop is delicious, juicy, tender, and a great portion size. Nice wine selection. Only issue is that this is the second time I've been seated quite a bit after my reservation time (about 20 min) but it's worth the wait..So delicious! At first I was a bit upset because I had a reservation and we were waiting close to a half hour to be seated. The host then offered to comp us a glass of wine at the wine bar right by to make up for it, which was lovely. We went back to the restaurant and sat in a very cozy booth where they brought us a free appetizer (the asparagus salad which was SO good). They more than made up for delaying our wait at this point. I ordered the duck which is amazing- one of the best I've had. The menu is well marked for gluten which I always appreciate. Wine was also delicious. Couldn't recommend enough!.Met up with friends for dinner for Saturday night. Food was great. We ordered some appetizers, olives, crispy calamari, oysters (fresh), fried artichoke (1st time having it, it was very tasty, must try), warm potato chips. Entree we tried the pork chop, miso cod, and squid inked penne with crab meat, sea urchin and hot pepper (it was the delicious). The pasta was excellent. The ambience, decor of the inside dining was very cute and cozy. It's a great place to meet up with friends for a night out with good food. The menu is small but the quality of food is there. Highly recommended..My friend and I were visiting New York and came here and let me tell you, love. First when we entered, we were asked to show our vaccination card which honestly, although this was supposed to be a state mandate, this was the only place I went on the trip where they asked. It made me feel like I was getting carded for the first time and it made me happy and completely set the tone for my night. My friend and I got two appetizers and I got three delicious Espresso Martini's which were amazing. For dinner I got the filet with fries and it was delicious. We also ended the night with a cheesecake that we shared. Such a great place with great service and food and beautiful atmosphere. This is the perfect place for girls night or a date (we sat next to the cutest couple who were on a first date)..First off, this is an adorable neighborhood, and The Leroy House definitely fits the vibe with its outdoor string lights and candlelit interior. I personally prefer sitting indoors although there is also seating outdoors. It is a very nice, intimate restaurant perfect for dates (especially if you can get a corner table). Random, but the bathrooms also smelled great because of the candles they use. AND they have light music playing in the restaurant (good music selection!). We did Restaurant Week (summer 2021) here and really do believe it was worth the value. I absolutely loved the salmon entree. It was cooked perfectly and the combo of flavors with the yogurt and nuts and carrots was amazing. I also enjoyed the chopped salad appetizer and calamari. Would also recommend picking the chocolate mousse for dessert. The only thing that left more to be desired was the service speed! It took us a long time for our server to come and grab our orders when we sat down. Otherwise, those that cleared our plates and filled our waters did a great job..Came here with 4 friends for drinks onlyAfter brunch at Hudson Clearwater on Saturday we were looking for a place to continue to next for a drink. The Leroy House was so kind and accommodating. They let all 5 of us  sit at the bar where the awesome bartender let us know it was happy hour! We al ordered 1 drink and sat for about an hour just enjoying the space and each other company. Once I realized how long we were there for I got a little nervous as most city bars would have been rude to you for sitting nursing a $10 drink but our bartender was so kind just kept filling up our waters letting us know to holler at him if we wanted more. The drink itself was absolutely to die for I got the Leroy and it was so great and fresh. Friends got the Raspberry punch and both ordered multiple of them :) I will 100% be coming back for dinner!.The Leroy House is a restaurant that I'd never previously heard of, but stumbled across on Yelp while looking for a place to eat at in West Village. My friend and I were pleasantly surprised by the quality of food here.Both the indoor and outdoor dining here are chic. The inside of the restaurant is small, but has classic West Village charm. They had two fish dishes on the menu. We each ordered one and ate half of each. The fish options were salmon with carrots and cod with coconut rice.The food was served quickly after we ordered. Both were comforting and satisfying. I didn't have a preference between each of the fish dishes. Service was attentive and welcoming. If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd be a regular here..I am glad I was somehow able to get a last-minute reservation for The Leroy House on Thanksgiving Weekend. It was a fun date night! The menu is fairly extensive, ranging from vegetarian options (salads, etc) to pasta and meats. There's adequate seating the back dining room and I think there's also a seating in the front lounge, but I did not really check it out. Our waitress was kind and quickly approached us when we arrived so we can place our drink orders. On that note, I was impressed with their cocktail selection! The food was fantastic! We shared the meatball appetizer, which was too small but really delicious. We each has pasta entrees which we're fantastic! The pasta tasted home made - not kidding :DI highly recommend you visit the Leroy House for a nice night out in the West Village. It's a classy place with delicious food and a fun atmosphere."
"I came with my boyfriend to have the lunch special. The food was well prepared. Soups were flavorful but needed to be hot, they were warm, still they were tasty. The ambiance was good, but music a bit too loud. We order hot Morocho ( and server put plastic. Spoon inside) please do not give plastic spoon with hot drinks since is toxic! Plus is terrible for the environment. Make sure to order bread, it's very fresh and tasty!.I really like their food.  Really good Ecuadorian food. However the service is bad.  The women that work there are mean and rude to their customers. They are not friendly at all. I was there today 9/7/2020 because I like their PAN con Nata, they do not greeting you, they ask ""what do you want"" not cordially. I asked for 4 things and she kept rolling her eyes.  The music is so loud it feels like walking into a cantina. Please if you are the owner, make some changes, you need better lighting, clean up and hire friendly staff. I am always looking for a good place to invite my colleagues so please make an effort to represent the Ecuadorian community better. About the music, you can always alternate or use Spotify. Thank you.I am falling in love with Corona restaurants and bakeries.  One reason due to Mama Leti's.  Although I just came here for dessert and coffee, i was very impressed with the pastries made here.  Came out was a fresh cheese phyllo dough pastry which was to die for.  Fresh or not this I am sure it would be just as good.  Coffee is good as well.  After reviewing the menu I would definitely come back for their lunch/dinner options..I wish I lived closer. We parked right in front of the 99cents store and saw this bakery right next to it and got some stuff. We got enormous toasted croissant, coffee and sometime of coffee with chocolate,it was quite good but I wish it had been hot as I would have enjoyed it more. Def. gonna stop by here if I am in the neighborhood..I'm not always a big fan of typical bakery style Hispanic desserts and pastries. Across various bakeries in New York, most of the breads and pastries that they sell are dry and bland. I'm not sure if they are meant to be eaten dipped in coffee, because that would make sense why they are so dry. Here they have the typical dry, bland pastries, but they also have a few awesome ones! My absolute favorite thing here sort of like a cream filled donut. Its essentially a soft donut sandwich with a cream layer in the middle, sort of like a Boston cream, in fact there is one that has chocolate on the outside, but I LOVE the sugared one. It tastes like a soft churro filled with pudding! Yum! I really enjoy the cheesecake here too.(The triangle pastries in the shelves, not the round cheesecake in the display case) It's denser and less sweet and creamy compared to American cheesecake. It's a great option for people who don't love super sweet desserts. I do love super sweet desserts and my favorite way to eat the cheesecake from here is to drizzle on some Coronado Cajeta (goats milk caramel).The tres leches from here is delicious, but it seems like several people have had issues with ordering it for parties, so maybe stick to buying it directly. The typical Guayaba (guava) pastries are just ok. Just remember, if it looks dry, it probably is. The cakes haven't looked appealing enough for me to get.Go for those delicious pudding cream filled pastries and the cheesecake!.If you're looking to make a quick stop to pick up coffee this is a great place. Great tasting coffee and even better croissants. However service, at least for dining in, was disappointing. Had to ask the waitress for the simplest things like utensils, and got a dirty look. Asked for water more than once and was ignored. Otherwise, the food was okay. Ordered the Chaulaflan, wasn't bad but not something I would want to have again, a bit too greasy..Mama Leti's is a breath of fresh air on Junction Blvd. In an area that is up to it's neck in Spanish restaurants of all varieties, Mama Leti's offers up a little something extra. You can find lots of good food in the area, but just TRY to find yourself some ambiance. It's near impossible! Mama Leti's is an exception.This is a retaurant/bakery. When you walk in, you're greeted with the sweet smelling aroma of their fresh baked goodies. Walk in further, and you'll find a small seating area. Recently remodeled, I think the best word to describe this place is darling. Too cute, very clean and a pleasant change from the places nearby.I ordered the media noche and it was greasy deliciousness. Ham, mortadella, pernil, melted swiss and pickles on a soft, sweet roll. Really authentic, and very filling. I'm still dreaming about it, and I'll be ordering it again when I return. I also had a chicken empanada. The filling was great, but the shell was too hard. Skip it, you can find better empanadas nearby at any number of places. I also fell in love with their homemade hot sauce, mixed with cilantro and served in a tiny dish. If it had been bottled, I would've stolen it and brought it home!My Mom had the oxtail soup, which came in a generous portion and she finished every last bite. She also had the churrasco, which we intended to share. I was too  full to have more than a few bites. That one plate alone would have been MORE THAN ENOUGH for one person. The steak, of course, isn't exactly USDA prime meat. But, it's tasty and they work wonders with it. It's a poor man's steak, pounded thin and served with rice, eggs, fries and salad. At $12, it's a steal and also, the most popular thing on their menu.Grabbed a tres leches to go, and it didn't disappoint. I had low expectations for Mama Let's, but it was far better than I thought. I'll be back again for another media noche..Me and my mom were excited to eat in here the place seemed so cute to eat in. We were wrong, we didn't get a nice table to eat in, so dirty and sticky. I try to ignore the fact that we were not getting good service and was excited to enjoy my food. I FOUND A ROACH IN MY CHICKEN SOUP. It was floating in my soup like if it was nothing. NEVER going back . Disgusting !!!.Mama Leti's is one of the nicer looking Ecuadorian restaurants in the community.It is small with just a few several tables.Their menu is simple ""little of everything"".I love their mote pillo with carne asada which is always well seasoned.Their food overall is good, but not to die for.Overall pretty positive EXCEPT the waitstaff. The owners should really try to hire people who LIKE to help customers and not ignore them. They are getting paid to help us spend our money there. I have received incorrect take-out orders despite me repeating it to them several times. i felt horrible when I wanted to treat my mother for breakfast there and we were completely ignored for the first 15 minutes when we were sitting right in front of them, I had to get up to get my own menu.Decent food and place would be truly wonderful if they had better service.I believe dining out or even take-out should be a wonderful experience full of great flavors and a thank you and a smile..bad food bad service oldleft over food most likely  from night before kitchen  dirty cause rest room in back of kitchenJust ask for restroom  to c for your self"
"I randomly dropped by Mudville for a quick bite after walking across the Brooklyn Bridge, and it was what the doctor ordered. It was perfect for me because it had an old-school and very low-key vibe, which made me feel like I was an easy-breezy neighborhood bar/restaurant. *Perhaps, it was a bit too low-key because the bar looked closed while I was passing by. I had to look very hard through the windows to ensure that it was open.* While Mudville is pretty close to a couple of tourist attractions (eg the Brooklyn Bridge), it did not feel like a tourist trap. A lot of the folks who were hanging out at the bar seemed to be from the area. Another highlight of my Mudville excursion was Mike ""the bartender"". He was absolutely wonderful in making recommendations for the various drafts that Mudville has.  While I normally do not hang out in TriBeCa, I would not mind returning for some quick bites (and more importantly some quick brews)..We had a $30 for $50 coupon through Yelp and that was a great surprise. Love the atmosphere and staff, especially the manager. It was a game day and we were happy to find this gem since we are from wayyyyy out of town. We had a few drinks and some awesome food. The mozzarella sticks that were wrapped in wonton paper and filled with cheese and pesto were different in the best way. That pizza though...we really weren't expecting bar pizza to be good but it was damn great! Only issue was the specialty drink menu. We ordered a couple drinks that sounded good on the menu but should never have existed in real life. Tap/bottle beer was definitely the way to go. Overall we would easily return if not just for the fun atmosphere and our super nice waitress..Was in the area and stopped in to grab a quick bite to eat and drink.  Happy hour is only from 3-6pm but it's buy one get one. The rosemary and lemon wings are the absolute best. I want to go back just for the wings!!!.Have been coming here for many years mainly for the delicious chicken wings and fries. Great collection of beer to go with it too. Returned almost after 2 yrs due to covid restrictions now. Weekday lunch so was not crowded at all.Food was delicious, wings came out well. I always go with Buffalo Hot sauce and it's perfect. Fries were great too - crispy but not greasy or burnt. Reason for 3 stars - The service was okay - meaning attentive but not friendly- not much thanks and welcome :(. Also felt price has been inflated far too much. Full order of 12 wings is $25 and fries $11 and beer $8 so $55 for simple meal for one with tip. For the ambience and setting, its far too much, one could get a lamb chops and asparagus for this price at a decent place. Most likely not returning again..Came in for a relaxing dinner and ended up being harassed by a ponytailed manager. Buffalo wings were great and the burgers were YUMMMMM, but we couldn't even eat in peace since she kept talking to us, she was also pretty tipsy, poor waitress was trying to shoo her away from us:)))) Food is great, drinks are a bit pricey but if you can't even eat in peace what's the point of coming to a restaurant???.Came here and sat outside. They have happy hour specials from 3-6 from Tuesday to Friday. We started off with cocktails which were a good amount of sweet and refreshing. We ordered brussel sprouts, wings, and mac and cheese to share. I also got the fried chicken sandwich and we got chocolate chip cookies with the bill. The meal was good and the service was prompt..Only walked in to get a drink cause it was scorching hot out there. We needed some a/c, a few chairs, and liquids. Never been here before, and will never be back. It was a one off. Sat at the bar, only a few others in the whole place - time was probably 5-ish pm. Lots of beer options on tap. Had a classic Margarita and it was good. Honestly nothing special about the place that stood out. The bartender was very sweet. I'd give the place 3.5 stars just because I really don't remember anything about it. Decent bar. That's it..Sasha was amazing. Great service and very friendly. Made sure our drinks were always filled and served with a smile. She provided great conversation and gave us an authentic experience. Overall, would recommend and hopefully you get served by Sasha and/or at the bar. If you are lucky, you may get both. Kat took over after Sasha was done with her shift. Great service and very attentive. She was great and also helped with out night in New York..Lucked into Mudville9 after visiting Lower Manhattan and was really craving a cold beer and a chance to take a load off after walking for a couple hours. I was able to sit at the bar and the lovely Sasha found me a number of cold Budweisers. She also put on my college football team's game- West Virginia Mountaineers. Thanks for the hospitality Sasha- you're a doll..Great restaurant with many options for everyone. We've ordered from them a few times, but last time we got the rosemary chicken wings. They're now our fav thing to order from here!"
"It wasn't to far from home the food was great I must say the host was amazing and she engaged with us the whole time   There was no complaints at all on my side s they get a five star  and I will definitely come back highly recommended.2-1/2 stars. Never have been a fan of habachis ever since I went to Makodos in Florida which was the absolute best.  This place was mediocre took my cousin from Croatia here and she was fascinated with the show they put on. As for the hibachi food it was mediocre. The meat was quite salty and the fried rice was oily. The sushi was actually decent, the rolls we ordered were well made  including the spicy tuna, tempura shrimp and dragon rolls. I also ordered the shogun punch cocktail which was quite tasty..We've been to Shogun before and had a great experience. We went back to celebrate a milestone yesterday, but left disappointed. I spent more time in fast food restaurants. We were seated, the appetizers appeared almost instantaneously and the chef took about 10 minutes to make the mains, we were given about 15 minutes to eat before take out boxes were put on the table. The turnaround on the tables was intense, it felt like a factory. We weren't even given the opportunity to order dessert. The food was good (the steak is delicious, so was the salmon, the shrimp were overcooked though), but the whole experience was extremely mediocre and quite the opposite of celebratory. We were literally in and out in 40 minutes. I am sure that's what you expect when you go to a burger place before catching a movie, but when you go to a hibachi restaurant, you expect to be entertained..The service was on par. We walked in and it didn't look like a hibachi place from the entrance. It looked like a sushi restaurant from the entrance as the hibachi part was in the attached room. They ask where you would like to sit and of course we said hibachi room. Just like the saying goes, when in Rome do what the Roman's do. So when at a hibachi place, you're there for the experience. Anyways, we were brought to get hibachi and given the menu while seated. It took awhile for the chef to get situated and cook for us, but once he did everything was good. They give you fried noodles that are sautéed in sauce for free.  After that I believe your meal should come with  salad with ginger sauce and clear soup. Both are really good. Believe me when they give you large portions so no need to order other things off the menu. I got the udon with spicy seafood. Yes, it was a bit spicy and I liked it. I also ordered this red cocktail and for the life of me I can't remember the name of it. But if you really like cherry juice you should order it, if not don't bother.So, I heard in the ladies room people were rating the place to each other and they said we'll come back. So there you go, perhaps one of these days I'll be back too..The food was really tasty and flavorful! As you can see the portion is large and worth the price - it served as two meals for me as I took leftovers home. Shogun punch was refreshing and went well with dinner (if you like fruity drinks, you'll like the shogun punch). I wasn't too impressed with the hibachi chef - we came for food and a show and our chef unfortunately didn't put much effort in his performance but the food otherwise tasted good. It's a hit or miss if you're looking for a chef that's putting in the effort into his performance as there was another working another table that was more into the performance..The food was great and the value was great. It took a little long to get them to come and take our order and our waiter didn't do as many of the tricks I have seen at other Hibachi's but we overall had a really great experience and we will be back..Came here during the pandemic but forgot to write a review however this place during that troubling time is worth a review being left. My family and I sat outside because there was no indoor eating at the time. The place had tables on the sidewalk with a divider up to make sure you were separated from the people walking by. The food was good. The drinks were good. The service was good. Nobody had any complaints. Would like to come back here now that indoor dining is back in effect so I can get the full experience..All the sushi rolls we ordered were yummy and can't wait to try the hibachi next time. The mountain roll was especially good! Ample seating..clean..service was attentive and overall very affordable!.Great neighborhood hibachi gem.  Went here for date night and had the while hibachi table to ourselves.  Ordered the seafood combo: lobster, shrimps and scallops and added the egg fried rice.  Food was delicious and came with mixed vegetables, soup and salad.  Great service, we will definitely come back..We have been to Shogun a few times but I haven't gotten around to writing a review until now. What can I say... Oh ya. RUN to them. They are just as good if not better than Benihanas. They have much more personal experience because it's a smaller place. They don't try to rush you in and out as fast as possible. The food is always amazing. And it won't break your wallet.The only negative that I can find is that at some of the tables you feel like you are cramped up against the wall. That's about it. Other than that we love it."

"Kaki-Toku Japanese Cuisine you are most certainly incredible, I had an incredible experience here yesterday. Such a great atmosphere and friendly staff. Every single thing I have ever bought here has been fresh and tastes wonderful. Staff are very nice and service is very swift. Do not miss out, check out Kaki-Toku Japanese Cuisine asap."
"Used to order from Trio, until I discovered how much better the pizza is here! I always order over the phone for pick up, because I can request that they make the crust thinner and crispier. In the times that I've randomly stopped by for a slice or a pie without ordering ahead, the difference is slightly noticeable. Their crust is delicious enough to begin with, but when it's thinner, the cheese to sauce to crust ratio is superbbA medium pepperoni or sausage pizza is about $20, in 6 slices, and normally, I'm crazy about pepperoni, but here, I'm crazy about their sausage. They're much more generous with the sausage as they cut it up in these thick and fat slices and just spread allll around. With pepperoni, I'm often confused because occasionally I get half pepperonis on my pies. WeirdddTheir cheese is a thicker layer too (yay!) and I'd say overall, the pie is saltier (and the grease pools are deeper) than the other ones on the block, but I'm not complaining, because if your pizza isn't greasy, it's not good. 10 Piece Chicken Wings ($13ish): these are a little on the small side but I like how crispy they are! Just wish they were a tad bigger Used to order the veal cutlet sandwich with cheese and peppers as well and it's really good. Big piece of meat that's coated nicely and the sandwich itself isn't too soggy even after taking it home.If I could give this spot zero stars I would. The pizza that they serve is regularly stale and rarely fresh. Ordered a slice at 12 p.m. and realized that they repeated yesterday's pie. Not to mention that the pizza at this place is mediocre and inauthentic. The Albanian owner is also extremely rude. Saw him yell at a customer once over the phone. Extremely rough and unprofessional..If I could give this spot zero stars I would. The pizza that they serve is regularly stale and rarely fresh. Ordered a slice at 12 p.m. and realized that they repeated yesterday's pie. Not to mention that the pizza at this place is mediocre and inauthentic. The Albanian owner is also extremely rude. Saw him yell at a customer once over the phone. Extremely rough and unprofessional..Pizza is okay at best. Kind of sad considering I had heard good things about this place. The cheese they use is very commercial and almost plasticky. Sauce is okay but nothing to write home about, Sercice was quick and prompt. They take credit cards on purchases over $10 and they also do the sausage rolls and specialty slices. At $3.25 for a slice of regular I can't say that I'd be back for another..I walked in tonight (8/4) and placed an order here for a large half cheese/half pepperoni and a large pineapple and meat (NOT CRUSHED UP MEATBALLS).  I watched carefully as he was making the pizza and noticed he didn't start yet, and I wanted to change it, but the man making it said he already made it and put it in the oven.  I thought maybe my eyes deceived me, so I just left it as is.  After the pizzas were pulled from the oven, I realized he had lied and he didn't put the pizza in before I requested the order change like he said he did.  The price was also crazy expensive in comparison to other places out here especially because the dude cut up meatballs, which I specifically requested him not to, and paired it with old disgusting pineapple.  Don't eat here.  The girl that stands around back there has a snarky attitude and the person making the pizza is the absolute worst.  Unimpressed..go to pizza spot both Ave U and W9th.solid NYC pizza. they have the perfect amount of cheese and sauce in my opinion, and thats big for me since im actually not a saucy person. my go to order is their sausage pie. honestly delicious. my only critique about it is that it needs to be cooked more. i like when my pizza has a crisp bottom, so whenever i do order it, i always ask for it well done..Classic NY style pizza deep in the heart of Brooklyn.  No pineapple or designer sushi toppings here. This place delivers classic pizza done extremely well.The crust,  and it's all about the crust, is thin and crisp on the bottom, but not too crisp,  not to bready, not too doughy. Singed just right on the bottom.  The top of the crust has just enough of a doughy texture to be able to fold the wedge to eat without it cracking or tearing the crust. You had to pull just the right amount with your teeth to tear your bite of pizza off the slice. The crust to tomato sauce to cheese ratio was spot on and the cheese and sauce came off appropriately with the crust bite.  The sauce want to thin and cheese want too gooey. Salt pepper oregano and chili flakes were all set out on each table, as it should be. Great job guys keeping real NY pizza alive!.Great, solid pizza slice with a good balance of tangy sauce and cheese. The square is soft and chewy and the edge pieces have good caramelization. We have dined in and ordered delivery and both are great experiences. But let me tell you about the eggplant parmesan plate, it's absolutely the best! The eggplant is sliced paper thin and fried to a tender finish. They layer the eggplant with sauce to what seems like a hundred layers. They top it with sauce and cheese and bake it to bubbly perfection. You get a choice of a side of pasta or salad and bread. I suggest getting the side of salad because it seems like you get a bigger portion of the eggplant which is easily shareable for two. I don't look forward to eggplant Parmesan from any other pizzeria. They're chicken Parmesan is pretty good but the chicken can be tough sometimes. We often get the beef pattie with cheese and it's baked up really tasty. N & D has great customer service and will not hesitate to customize an order..Just randomly stopped by this pizza joint.  Great pizza, made it fresh and quality ingredients.  A slice of cheese will bring you back to what a real NYC pizza is, nothing fancy, you can smell the goodness, one bite you can taste the real deal.  This place also has some new twists and varieties. Order couple slices is the best way to sample them. Highly recommended.  Keep up the good work! Love to see you around. Definitely come back for more..N & D is about 20 feet from a competitor pizzeria. That is not common but often when that happens, there are benefits for diners. I noticed that they take credit cards. Many neighborhood pizzerias do not. They have a nice TV. Many other pizza places do not. They have the name of their restaurant and address on their customized pizza (take out) box. That is quite rare for NYC pizza places to not use a generic box. Also the man behind the counter was very nice to me. Sometimes that is not true in similar places. I also noticed that they open at 10 AM. Most others open at 11 AM. It is necessary to be extra competitive, to stay in business. I have noticed them and their nearby competitor for many years. They are doing what is necessary to keep diners happy. I had higher than usual expectations for their food and they were met. The pizza was four and half stars. It had a very good blend of cheese, oil and tomato sauce. The crust could have been a little bit more tasty but it was close to perfect. The price was only $15.00. But that is expected with intense competition. Had a good pizza and will be sure to return..This pizzeria is the real deal. As a Brooklyn native i can tell you there are very few places in the city that sell a real slice or pie of NYC pizza. It's delicious and super affordable. Their marinara sauce is so delicious that my mother, aunt and I tried to figure out their secret ingredients. I mean they should sell it by the jar!! I think their secret in everything they make is their fresh and authentic ingredients. I love their sauce and cheese soo much. My mother, aunt and daughter cannot pass by this location without indulging on a pie or anything we can get our hands on. I cannot Bragg enough about their costumer service, they make you feel like you are part of the family; so warm and welcoming. I have eaten on all the so call top and old school pizzerias in the city and i can honestly say this pizzeria is absolutely my favorite."
"This is an amazing hole-in-the-wall thai place! The food is super delicious and fresh (their open kitchen gives you a view of your food being made to order). The ingredients are of very high quality - and even if you're not a brown rice eater regularly, I highly recommend you try theirs (just trust me). They offer lots of vegan options (and don't worry, these don't skip on the flavors!). And the service is great - attentive but not pushy, gracious and thorough.If you dine in - get their hot ginger tea!.Unassuming hole-in-the-wall restaurant in Woodside with a significant menu for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. Saturday afternoon was able to get a table inside (no outside seating that day).After much deliberation, settled on the Fish Curry ($17). A large bowl of grilled fish, eggplant, beans, and peppers swimming in green curry. Spice level is just right and blends into the ingredients (cooked together always makes the dish better). Only complaint is that the fish could have been grilled longer for a crunchy texture. Our server here was very nice and got our food out in no time. Definitely a spot for all types of people with restrictions as they are okay with substitutions as well..I am actually very surprised that everything on the menu is very good (because usually restaurants only have a few specialties). I have been eating here for 1.5 years and write review very rarely but I definitely need to recommend this one. I am Thai is definitely the best restaurant in the Queens area in both the deliciousness and price. Their Thai Iced Tea is very special and not too sweet (I drank 2 cups straight haha). In terms of the food, I recommend you try whatever catch your eyes haha because everything on the menu is so good, esp the Pad Thai and Curry Chicken! We also had a great experience with the service as well ^^!.You can sit outdoors or indoors. We chose to stay indoors. The waitress said that we can choose to sit anywhere. The menu is right in the front right by the sanitizer, utensils, and credit card machine. I can see that a lot of people do take-out here. We ordered three things off the menu. Ordered appetizers first which were Curry Puffs which wasn't that great. If I had to choose again I would go for something else. The entrees ordered were Bangkok Noodle Soup and Basil Ground Chicken + Twin Eggs (this is under the over rice fried eggs section). The noodle bowls come with either rice noodles or eggs noodles. I was recommended to get the rice noodles with my dish. In it is the spicy sweet and sour soup with ground pork, fish ball and sliced roasted pork topped with peanut, scallion, and cilantro. You can choose how spicy you want it and I got medium which to me was bland so I asked for their Thai chili peppers. Oh my was I in for a shock afterwards.  If you want spicy eat the peppers with your entree. The over fried eggs dish is made from freshly fried eggs, veggies on the top of steamed Jasmine rice. Thai style fried eggs are ready to be put on the top of your over rice dishes. It was good. I would suggest this to eat. I'll probably go back later on as there are so many restaurants to check out in the neighborhood..i really wanted to like this place but it just wasn't up my alley, i do think it's okay though, i just wouldn't eat it again if i had the choice of another thai place. the food: i got pad see yew which was too oily for me. not a lot of beef pieces at all and only a few shreds of broccoli too, mostly noodle. the payaya salad was the highlight, i enjoyed the fish sauce that wasn't overbearing and peanut crunch. the red curry was very coconut-y, if you like the taste of coconut milk! and lastly the tom yom soup just wasn't my vibe..I Am Thai deliver from their own website for $2 fee iamthairestaurant.comWe ordered Vegan spicy noodles ( got them medium & they WERE SPICY!) & Vegan Pineapple Fried Rice  -Delicious and great variety of veg in the dishes. Delivery was quick and contactless. Support local businesses during pandemic and order delivery. Cheerio!.Pad Thai & Duck are awesome! It's a good spot to order delivery or stay in for a bite..Super cute small Thai spot by my childhood neighborhood. Always convenient, fast, and fresh. Most of all the customers service is great and quick. Great all around. I like the papaya salad and fried rice!.I think I Am Thai is the best spot for Thai food in Sunnyside! I mostly do take out from I am Thai and enjoy it just as much at home. I recently ate at the restaurant on a Friday early afternoon and it was quite, clean and so good. I recommend the pad see ew!.The food is sooo tastyyyy here! I couldn't get a pic of the pineapple fried rice because it smelled so good that we started eating it right away lol. It had a little bit of curry flavor to the rice which was unique and delicious! I also really enjoyed the pad see ew!! The noodles were super flavorful. The staff was friendly, the place was clean, well decorated, and the street was quiet which made our outdoor dining experience relaxing and enjoyable. We will definitely return to try more dishes!.Love that they have so many veg options! The food is delicious too. The currys are much better than the vegan pad thai, and the scallion pancake isn't at all what you'd expect, but it's still a delightfully chewy homage to one! I would definitely go back! No Thai beer though , or any beer..., but you have bars down the block anyway."
"This place is HORRIBLE. They gave me some old ass French fries that felt AND tasted like they've been there since the store opened. The chicken sandwich was TRIFILING ass hell. Oily, soggy bun, the mayonnaise looked like semi-dry cum and the chicken looked freezer burned and skinny as shit. The only half way decent item there were the biscuits. They have the nerve to charge all that money for those STALE ass fries, too. Don't walk up in this ghetto ass place, son. Save ya money.FURTHERMORE, the staff are a pack of birdbrains. No fucken way it takes two people to put food in a bag. They're disorganized and slow as fuck. It's called fast food for a reasons.This is simply disgusting all the reviews posted regarding this location are spot on. My chicken looks pink and brown they skimp on the sides . I will not be getting thing else from here ..I ordered 12 pieces of chicken to go. When I got home, not only did they give me a bunch of wings, they gave me a chicken tender instead of an actual piece of chicken! My boyfriend got the chicken sandwich and according to the photo, there were supposed to be pickles in it. He had nothing but a chicken patty in his sandwich. The chicken felt more greasy and just not as fresh. I'll be taking my business to the Popeye's on Surf or a Chinese-owned Popeye6feom now on..I went there. They messed up the order. Twice.. The Mac and cheese I ordered was very runny.Two different occasions these people messed up my order and leave out an item. My first trip they left out a piece of chicken that I paid for.Today they left out a side that I paid for.They are NOT focused. They don't even make up for THEIR ERRORS by offering Atleast a free piece of chicken. BEWARE OF THIS LOCATION STAFF ....FOCUS!!!!.Disgusting! When this place first opened this place was packed. I bought my first chicken sandwich from here about 2-3 months ago and it was delicious. I came back last month and the sandwich wasn't so great. It was dry. Really weird. I come here today and this place is empty. And it's been empty every time I come here not like before when there was always a long line. So I'm like what happened to this place.  Why is it empty. I order my chicken sandwich and I get home to eat it. I bite down the middle of it and it's hard and cold. NASTY! I go back and tell them what happened. I show them how hard it is. Nasty. So they changed the sandwich for me. I get to work bite down into it the new sandwich which and it's cold and hard just like the one I just exchanged. DISGUSTING! They just reheat chicken sandwiches and sell them. My stomach turns just thinking about it. I will NEVER come here ever again. I will never go to any Popeyes ever again!!"
"We recently ate here for my husbands birthday with a group of friends.  First off, the service is wonderful. Super attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly.  The appetizers were delicious and eclectic.  Our main dishes were plentiful and very thoughtful flavors and styles.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone!.Came in on a busy Saturday morning with no reservation and got seated in about 10 minutes. The service was great, bottomless mimosas were strong and the staff did not let our glasses get empty. We had the chicken panini and the Smoked Salmon Benedict. The food was great but I felt like the pesto on the panini had more flavor than the chicken. The Salmon Benedict and rosemary onion potatoes were delish, the buttermilk biscuit and honey butter were to die for. Overall, very good service, great food, and great bottomless mimosas. Would definitely recommend..On a Sunday was looking for a bottomless brunch and found this place on Open Table.  While we weren't able to make a reservation, we decided to walk over anyways.  Just a short hop across five avenues...and four streets..made it to the destination ready for some drinks.  We grabbed seats at the bar and had Conner as our bartender.  Right away started with bottomless mimosas and it really was bottomless.  Every time my partner's glass was empty mine was filled up again...so was never empty! Ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and the French toast with a side of bacon.  The spaghetti was just ok, really bland.  The French toast was delicious, didn't need syrup on every bite..but I've got a sweet tooth so the more the merrier. Bacon could have been more cooked for my taste.  While sitting at the bar, I saw two bottles of Harlem Standard and inquired to where they were made.  Thinking there could be a distillery in Harlem, Conner read the label and they are made in non-other than...Indiana?!?!Next time will plan a bit more in advance to grab a table, overall great experience..So this restaurant has such potential to be thee best in Harlem. However, the bar clientele ruins everything about what they seem to be about (and this is my perspective as a customer). There's a television  in there that attracts bar patrons who are watching a game. And that fact alone, fosters the WRONG atmosphere for the entire venue and even more so for the food. This is NOT a sports bar. And yet because there's a television showing sporting events there, there are trashy bar patrons literally yelling at not only the game but at others in the bar. All of this whilst most everyone else is trying to enjoy the fantastic cuisine and/or atmosphere of a true restaurant.I sat at the bar tonight, and because there were drunk sports fans surrounding me, they literally RUINED my entire experience at Lido. Ruined. They were unnecessarily shouting at the television, screaming obscenities at one another, and just outright being trashy. For a venue like this is with a menu of such well thought out food & fantastic staff, it is not in sync overall. Management needs to rein in the customers who are publicly humiliating not just themselves but the restaurant--because it seems that the complacency towards such offensive behavior is not only acceptable but condoned. Money alone does not dictate class--how one CHOOSES to act in public does. And the basis that Lido does not seem to care about that factor, makes them a trashy establishment..Came here for brunch and I found everything to just be okay.  Fortunately, they do take reservations so that is helpful.  We did get seated with no issue.  I ended up getting the white polenta since that seemed like something more unique here.  It had a decent flavor but still felt like it was on the blander side and missing something.  There were plenty of mushrooms, but that was about all that was giving any flavor with the cheese adding some richness.  The bread and poached eggs were both good.  What I sort of had more issue with here was the service which just seemed somewhat unattentive.  Overall, this was an okay place, but I don't think I'd make a trip out for this one..Cute and delicious brunch place in Harlem that has been very accommodating for large groups. I've been here twice for bottomless brunch and each time has been wonderful. Their portions are kind of small but their food is really tasty and the bottomless mimosas leave you drunk for the whole day. They keep pouring without you asking which is the best. Also, their decor is so aesthetically pleasing! One of the outdoor seating areas which my group of 18 was able to reserve for our entire party had a bunch of fake cherry blossoms and fairy lights which was so cute. Overall, would highly recommend!.Had brunch here with my friends this wknd. Nice vibes and tasty food.  Pros: --Bar tender/server (Conner) was super nice and helpful--we didn't have a reservation, but we were seated quickly at the bar--food was really good, and the perfect portion to be able to finish it all. --$18 bottomless mimosa Cons: --no coat check--a bit crowded, but I guess that's par for the course in the area. We really enjoyed this spot, and I can see myself returning..This is a great neighborhood spot for brunch or dinner. They have a nice array on the menu and great for groups. Sometimes you may have to wait for a table, but definitely worth it!.Drinks were great. Food was delicious. We ate outside. I ordered the calamari appetizer and the zucchini fries appetizer. They were so good. Presentation was very nice too. The service could have been better. Our server was rude for no reason. As we were seated and throughout the dinner, we all noticed the attitude we got anytime we ordered anything. It was a bit weird.  Besides the weird service, everything else was great. I got the mule. Very tasty. Would definitely go back again and recommend. I think it would make a cute date place  or a nice happy hour place with some friends..Met a friend for brunch and it was a lovely brunch experience. The ladies at the front -2 hostess were friendly and welcoming. We had reservations and were seated within 5 minutes. Make reservations it gets super busy.  Lido also offers Bottomless mimosas w an order of a brunch entree ($16 for an 1 hr 1/2). I was nursing a hangover so I was  hungry hungry. I ordered. the OMELET OF SPICY ITALIAN PORK SAUSAGE, HOLLAND PEPPERS, VIDALIA ONIONS, GOAT CHEESE, GRATED PARMESAN, FRESH HERBS, DOUBLE SMOKED BACON, and CREAMY GARLIC PARMESAN BREAD. I also had Stella beer and a shot Jameson! Bc i cure a hangover w more alcohol. My friend had, OMELET OF ROASTED TOMATO AND FONTINA, GRILLED BREAD WITH BASIL PESTO, BUTTERMILK BISCUIT W CHIPOTLE HONEY BUTTER. We enjoyed our brunch, the food was delish and waiters were attentive and super cool. I want to come back for dinner looks divine. Happy brunching!"
"A cozy coffee shop to relax when you arrive too early for activities or before the shops open in the morning. They always have the best tasting cup of joe, and decent breakfast foods to with it.The decor is very cozy and funky but I absolutely love it.I felt like I was back in Europe again!.Great location on Wythe.  I've been here a couple times.  Sweet spot with good pastries and some outdoor space in the back during the warmer months.  Nice interior decor with a cozy, home vibe.Everything I've had here is delicious and fresh.  They have these delicious apple cider flowers that are sort of a cinnamon bun with apple in the shape of a flower.  They are just so yummy.  The muffins are great too.  Good coffee.  Service is friendly.  Glad to be a customer of Bakeri..The quiche. THE QUICHE. Go get it right now. Why are you still sitting there!? GOOOOO!This quiche is huge. It's overflowing with veggies - leeks, potato, and cauliflower. It has perfect crust. It is baked to perfection. You will almost certainly have a wet dream about it later. I can't remember what else I had here because the quiche is dominating my memory. But I know they also had great coffee and a mouth-watering selection of incredibly pastries, both sweet and savory. To die for. Go here..A cute cafe located near Domino Park. Small cafe that serves beverages, snacks, and a lunch menu. They have a small seating area inside and a couple tables outside. The lunch menu does close at 4 but they have small snacks readily available. I got a small latte and ham and cheese roll. The latte was perfect; I don't normally add sugar so it wasn't too bitter to taste without any. I was very happy with the ham and cheese roll. The bread was soft and lightly seasoned with herbs, and the cheese added a light flavor. I do wish I asked for it warmed up, it probably would've been even better! I would come again to hopefully try their lunch menu..A very French bakery in Williamsburg. I pass by it nearly everyday and stop by to pick up breakfast every now and then when the line isn't snaking around the block. The space is small and they are open only from 8am to 3pm which limits my visits to the morning hours. They also have some great pastries and croissants which change every other day. Their best offerings are the kale and cheese roll, the ham and cheese roll, the banana date bread, savory tart, and their financier's. They used to make a very good chocolate cake. So if you are there on a day they have it, get it..Small cute place that makes you feel like your at a French cafe. Definitely recommend if you're in the area!.I ordered a focaccia sandwich with tomato jam, cheese, and arugula and a blueberry almond pastry. Both were so delicious!! The focaccia bread was amazing. It was crispy, yet chewy. I took a couple minutes to look at all of the baked goods before ordering. Everyone working that I interacted with during my visit was super friendly and patient. I can't wait to go back!!.Cozy neighborhood coffee shop with a great selection of food as well. I always get the raspberry pistachio muffin when I pass by and it's unbeatable. The ordering and line system is a bit hectic, but it's worth the anxiety to get a great cup of coffee and a pastry. Would visit during off peak hours if possible..Bakeri caught my attention because when I walked by, there was a yuge line going down the block for this one bakery. I knew I had to try it out when I got the chance.I ordered a few things from them, the grapefruit yogurt loaf, rosemary hazelnut chocolate chip cookie, raspberry lavender crumble bar and coconut macaroon. The loaf was my favorite; it was so fulling and very tasty - not too sweet, not too citrus, and not too oily. The other items were standard good. The cookie was large and fluffy and soft, and slightly salted, which was not necessarily my cup of tea..Sweet (pun intended) local meeting spot. More than just a bakery! Had breakfast there. Delicious! And their pastries are amazing! Cute and quaint. Felt like I was back in Paris."
"Spent the day, 12 hours, on an Amtrak train. Decided to fast during the trip. Water Only.  Stepped off the train back home in NYC at Penn Station. Just could not wait to drop my bags and unpack then go for dinner.  Saw a new Panda Express on the corner coming out on 8th Ave.  Thought ""Why Not"" couldn't wait anymore.  So, here I sit inside the new fast food Asian spot across from Penn Station not eating much and writing this review. (Remember I was starving! Hmmmmm)Not many folks in line....hmmmmmSelections looked somewhat fresh... which is a good thumbs up for NYC!! Got the Orange Chicken and Teriyaki grilled chicken 2 entry meal.  Did 1/2 Rice and noodles too. Okay so far. Sat down and dug into the orange chicken, one my favorites.  Expecting the tangy sweetness and was very disturbed to chew on basically a salt rock. Salty dried out chicken chunks. Moved over to the noodles. Crunchy and half cooked. Rice? Barely cooked with pieces of almost frozen peas and carrots. Wow Finally. The saving grace. The Teriyaki Grilled Chicken.Delicious! Nice! Soft bold, and rich in flavor. Not bad!  It saved the dinner all in one bite. Yum!  The stars are for that alone.Did I eat it all?  Of course!  I fasted all day! Even salted meat chunks taste good after a long bout of fasting..Never left a review on Yelp but this place boils my blood so bad I HAD to. (Note I work in the area so I frequent this Panda)  1) First when you walk in you get ""welcomed"" by the staff in a very aggressive manor. Might be part of some Feng Shui corporate strategy they use to project their frustrations out on the customers in a positive manor? 2) The serving portion sucks. I can see the employee basically counting the pieces of chicken they serve as if they make commission off this. Plus, the noodles are all cabbage little noodles. 3) THE WORST PART*** After you food is served it sits uncovered in line behind everyone else's who is waiting to pay before you (usually like 5 people). They only ever have 1 cashier and the whole checkout process takes like 10 minutes as they keep trying to take your change for donations and round ups. Delivery guys run in and out cutting the line asking for pick ups. TheY throw the cashier off task. Your food continues to sit in purgatory as the cashier struggles to check out guests. Some Panda employee will occasionally slide your open plate slightly closer to the register from time to time as new plates now stack up behind yours. Your food gets touched by like 4 employees before you ever get to pay and take it for yourself. 4) Local crackheads and rude euro tourists help complete the shitty dining experience by providing further annoyances the minute you (finally) get your food and grab a seat. Really wish the manager lead who looks like Sheng Chi would channel all that Asian strength and aggression into keeping the line moving by adding a second cashier. That way he could provide a better overall customer experience and secure that $72K a year General Manager bag he's so focused on attaining..The beef and chicken were good but the rice..... Orange chicken= goodBeef broccoli = fine Fried rice = UNPREDICTABLE They give u forks.Panda Express is a nostalgic mall food for me. My friend has never been to PE before and we decided to grab dinner together at this beautiful joint. She said it was better than expected !!! For a quick fast casual Chinese- American meal, Panda Express is the crem de la crem !!!.Love the food here. The orange chicken is definitely my favorite. We also love the general tso as well. I like being able to see the food hot and fresh prepared right in front of you while you wait. The chain is very consistent and the food always tastes the same at each. No bad surprises only yummy ones..Good if you like to microwave leftovers. Their Doordash delivery man was 40 minutes late with cold food..Already a big fan of Panda so I'm a bit biased, but fast casual Chinese food that I know what to expect from is perfect!Its midtown so it gets busy and there are characters around this location, but it's still a delicious fast option to burger joints.Just tried this place. Never again. The Almond Chicken is just all bread. I could not even taste the chicken and it was way overdone. The fried rice was the only saving grace. It's not bad. But don't count on a cold drink from this place!. All the drinks were warm so I asked for a cup with ice. He said, ""I'll have to charge you."" The price was $2.50! For a cup with ice! $14. for lunch and they want $2.50 for a cup with ice? Seriously? How about this... do yourself a favor and go to a real Chinese restaurant where the food is good and the drinks are cold. This place ain't that..Atmosphere (1/5): Horrible fast food atmosphere with trays lying around and near empty chili bottles.Food (2/5): Food was OK but the actual selection was extremely poor. Not to mention the food that was out seemed oldService (1/5): There was literally only one waitress serving food and she was out of this world slow. She would take nearly 10 minutes per customer. Once I got to the payment desk they charged me extra for certain food that was not labeled as extra. Overall: Terrible experience. Even though I live near the place, I will never come back..I like panda express cause you can see almost everything they have available and food ain't bad especially the chicken teriyaki, orange chicken and veggie dumplings with fried rice. I visited the west side location and its only takeout and no sit in .Not crowded at all so I can look at the menu overhead and order without being rushed.  Got my slacker crew the chicken with mixed veggies, egg roll and fried rice combo and for me its the chicken teriyaki combo and for 70 bucks total I won't bitch and moan cause the food ain't bad especially if you get there before 1pm . The workers seem to do a good job keeping the place clean and during these times that matters very much ."
"Take out spot, one of quite a few in my neighborhood. The food is excellent, and I will always rave over their fried rice. Very flavorful, not the everyday yellow fried rice one gets from other places. These guys can get busy but it's worth the wait. My favorite from here, boneless ribs with pork fried rice..Alot to say about this one food was amazing people know how to traet you didnt speak chineese once filled up my tea every couple min great place to visit for sure if your in the neighborhood and at a very exceptional price great job guys"
"I have lived across the street from this Chinese restaurant my entire life. Over the past couple year the price of items has increased little by little, but still better than the Chinese spot up the block across from the park. The staff has been the same and Chinnna is still mean, but you have to be in this neighborhood. There is no seating. You order for pick up and head home."
"First thing I noticed coming into here around Thanksgiving was that there is a security guard inside the store. Very nice!The ladies at the counter were super friendly and sweet. My friend ordered a chicken burrito and I just ordered guac and chips. Service was fast and when they saw the line building up, more people jumped at the counters to keep the line flowing. I appreciate them having free water cups and hand sanitizer at the counter too. A great place to eat right near the Port Authority!.I was in midtown and in the mood for a burrito. I've tried dos toros, a while back, at the union square location and I liked it. I saw they opened this, new to me location, in midtown, so I gave it a try.It's located near the corner of 38th St and 8th Ave. The setup is larger than the union square location. There's a menu board and counter, where you order. You can see the food being made in front of you. It's setup, similar to a Chipotle.They don't accept cash. So you have to pay with another method.I ordered the carne asada burrito. For some reason the burrito didn't taste as good as I remembered, from the union square location. There was something missing from it. I'm not sure what. There really wasn't that much flavor to the meat. It was pretty much just an ordinary burrito. It was pretty large and filling, but that's about it..Probably one of the best tacos I have ever had. The value is there too.I ordered 2 carne asada tacos. You choose cheese or no cheese, then you have toppings like salsa, corn, sour cream, tomoatos, and guac. It was soo good and so filling. I would have eaten more if I didn't have more to try on my food tour around town.The restroom code is on the receipt. Tables are limited. So if you have a larger group, you might have to split up. I think the largest table sat 4 comfortably, 6 if you squeeze together.Restrooms were clean and staff was friendly. No cash here, credit only. Water cups in the front..So I just finished grabbing lunch here. Originally I was in the mood for a burrito and was just going to stop by the chipotle that's a block away. However, chipotle was packed and so I decided to give this place a chance. I found it to be pretty much the same in quality and price. Only differences are that this place doesn't accept cash which is fine with me, and they also have farro as an alternative to rice which is pretty nice. They also sell beer which is always a plus and I did like how clean everything was though. However, nothing too spectacular about the food here but still solid for a burrito, bowl, or salad. Might come back and check out their tacos one day..This location is new so it's clean, and the quality is good for now.  The food and service is great.  It's on the pricier side with burrito bowls (with meat) going for around $11 but they also give you a lot of portion.The menu is similar to Chipotle with options for tacos, burrito bowls, salads, etc.  I haven't been to Chipotle in a while but the difference is that Dos Toros tastes better.  They also have a quesadillas.  Unfortunately they don't have Chorizos like Chipotle.Again, the quality of service and food are excellent for now.  I would like to remain optimistic that it stays this way but we've all experienced poor service and food quality due to disgruntled employees as the establishment gets older.  My one negative feedback is that there was one time when we ordered delivery for our company meeting and they completely botched the order.  Not once, but twice, to the point where my colleague had to go to the store to let them know if the error and to pick up the orders.We ordered 5 bowls and we only received 1 from the delivery person.  Called the store and they said they would fix it and send the remaining orders.  Delivery person comes again and gives us 2 bowls.  We're still missing 2 bowls!  My colleague ultimately ended up going to the store to pick it up..TIP: 1/30 is $1 burrito dayBOTTOM LINE: quality fast foodWHO: party of 3WHY: training day for staffWHAT: (Deets) Carnitas Burrito & Carne Asada Plato, both with guac. I'm not huge steak fan, but the carne aside was juicy and though a bit chewy, was also flavorful. Similarly, the carnitas were chewy but pretty tasty. I enjoyed the al dente rice texture. I asked for a side of guac, but the servers didn't put it in my bag. sad face.WHEN: 1/29/18WHERE: take awayHOW: car/ bike/ public transportation A/C/2/3 trainsBATHROOM: roomy (2 stall, separate gender)WIFI:DRESS CODE:SERVICE: Friwndly speedy. The line was to the door when o walked in, and I had ordered and received my food in less than 6 minutes..The service is so TRASH. This is the second time I went in there and had issues getting CHIPS AND GUAC! I walk in there is ONE GIRL ON LINE STILL PICKING OUT THINGS FOR HER ORDER! I walk up straight to the register as I've been told to do before if you are ordering straight chips and guac. The girl at the register tells me ""I'm going to take her first"" the girl is still adding things to her order. You are just standing there waiting why wouldn't you just take my order???? The bag of chips is right next to the register.I say nothing step back let the girl finish her order and pay. What does the girl at the register do finishes her order goes to the back of the food line and asks for the next guest AS IF IM NOT STANDING AT THE REGISTER IN FRONT OF HER!?!?! Like what???? You left me standing there knowing I was waiting to order lmao? Who does that? Then a manager I'm assuming points to another girl to take my order. She was confused and about to charge me for someone else's food. I had to tell her what I had been waiting for. Just a hot MESS. They need better service at this place. This is the 3rd time I've had issues ordering.Do better. Blue Maiz is across the street by the way..The newest location of the Dos Toros empire just opened, which meant $1 burritos (or other entrees) for opening day. Even though it was the official opening day, ordering and going down the line didn't really feel that different from any other Dos Toros, which was nice.I got the plato with carnitas, farro, black beans, vegetables, salsa verde, guacamole, tomato salsa, corn, cheese, and lettuce. (Love that guacamole is part of the $1 deal on opening day!) I found the carnitas a little too salty for me, so I'll probably stick with my usual chicken instead on future visits. This area of 8th Avenue has a lot of fast casual spots, but it's always nice to have more options, especially when they're as tasty as Dos Toros..Honestly I am so happy I decided to try this place, I came here one day after a supervision meeting at work, technically the store was closed but the door was open, it was probably 10:52, they open 11. The workers were really nice and seem excited to help with whatever, they allowed me to sit and wait while they continue to prepare for opening, one employee even came to me while I was seated and gave me a menu while I waited, at this point I am impressed. 2 other guys came in when the store opened and they told them that I was waiting for a long time and they will serve me first and be right with them, at this point i am flooredddd by the customer service. I was so happy to order my food that I disregarded my initiate cheap ways and ordered more food just because the service was so good. I was really in the mood for tacos so I ordered a variety of chicken and steak. I'm not a big red meat eater, I personally didnt like the steak but I fell in love with the chicken. The mild sauce was ok but I wanted a kick and couldnt wait to come back and try the hot sauce. I came back and tried the chicken burrito with hot sauce omggg. So hot, so good, i didnt regret it. Third time back and I'm back again with the chicken burrito..omg they have farrooo.. so cool, but I'm gonna stick with rice this time,bi love yellow rice... no hot sauce this time, boy I need it, but I'm against eating spicy food in the morning on a empty stomach.Now I'm sitting here thinking ""I wonder if they cater"" I would love to have this at an event, there's something for everybody. And YES they do cater.Decent food, and one star customer service...The girl working the register was extremely rude (and I see other comments about this). I had my 1 year old daughter with me, which can be distracting. I didn't notice this was a cashless restaurant until I got to the register. I'd left my wallet at my friends house, but she said they didn't take Apple Pay. When she realized I had no cards, she typed in my card numbers. While she was doing this, the guy making my burrito wrapped it up, even though I had just said I wasn't done adding toppings. He unwrapped my burrito (with an attitude) which caused it to break after taking one bite (see photos). The cashier didn't ask if I wanted a drink, so I assumed it was included...she became angry when re-entering my card numbers. She handed me a glass coke, without offering to open the top. The girl working in the back was nice enough to do it for me. They were standing right next to each other the entire time. This was mainly a result of both employees not paying attention. The food is alright, I second the comment saying it's a ""white-washed Mexican restaurant""."
"Amazing! Ordered delivery from this place and it had been the best breakfast I've had in a long time. They package the food really nicely and it was still warm when it arrived. The bacon was to die for! The hueves rancheros were amazing as well. Ordered french toast and pancakes also which were also pretty good..Ordered two takeout burgers medium rare. One of the burgers was way too rare for medium rare and unfortunately inedible. The other one was a perfect medium rare and awesome, so it appears to be an inconsistency in their cooking. It's too bad cause the flavor otherwise was great but it's tough to overlook one of the burgers being inedible. The burgers don't come with fries FYI. Tots were solid..Came to Hill & Bay for a quick early dinner before heading to the movies...service and food was good. Food arrived pretty quick upon order..Shared chicken parm, fries and sweet potato fries and cheeseburger with bacon... very filling. Good location spot in Kips B..Came looking for a quick and yummy brunch spot and this place mostly fits the bill. It's not going to blow your socks off, but you'll find a reasonably priced, basic brunch here. Pro tip: Get the hangover helper sandwich with a side of tots. The aioli really makes the sandwich!Biggest surprise: Don't get the iced coffee. It was really bitter - saw some yummy looking lattes though! All in all: I wouldn't climb hills to come here, but it does the trick in a bind..Nice guy at the counter! Ordered Iced capp from the outdoor counter. Solid Cappuccino with typical Manhattan prices. Met expectations - would come again.This staple is a favorite of my girlfriend and I. We'd grab lunch or dinner here. The service is efficient and the food is of good quality. I prefer the indoor seating than the outdoor seating (due to covid). It's not that I hate tents but their set up outside isn't so cozy. The inside is much more cozy because of their lighting and warm atmosphere. The place is clean, neat, and with attentive friendly staff who practice COVID-19 safety regulations. Enjoy..Such a great neighborhood spot to get delicious meals or a quick coffee on the go.I ordered the truffle spinach ravioli and it was do decadent and yummy! They are super fast with delivery as well in case you want to just eat at home..Signature grill house burger is a must try. Crispy fries and a nice cold brewski! And you are all set! Great service. Nice bar selection. Very tasty food. Delicious..Cute little American restaurant in the city! Came here on a Saturday afternoon around 12pm, was able to score indoor seating since it was kind of cold but there was option to sit outdoors as well in a covered patio!They scan your temperature at the door and have you scan a barcode to put down for contact tracing.Tables were social distanced, staff wore masks and gloves and sanitizer was provided at the tables. Staff was also very courteous and helpful with selections and questions. Ordered 5 pieces brunch which was your typical eggs with pancakes and turkey sausage. Their tater tots were bomb! Also the shoestring fries are a must go, crispy and not soggy at all!Tomato soup was perfect temperature and saltiness, the burger was also very tasty and not overcooked.We were sitting for a while and they didn't rush us out to pay or leave even as the restaurant got more crowded. They also were able to separate our checks individually and you have the option to scan the barcode and pay directly from your phone. Pretty awesome technology! If you haven't tried this place yet you have to go!.This place is a good spot in the neighborhood. They have an extensive menu and their wings are good. It's a little pricy, but to be expected for the area. They have good TVs to watch sports and a good outside area. The service is also good..This place is an under rated place to watch sports. They have tons of TVs and a good selection of beers. They have amazing happy hour specials (some run all day) and each day is different. To offset their insane happy hours, the menu is actually super pricy for a bar. And even for NYC. Half an avocado as a side is $4.50, which is outrageous. So stick to the HH and you will be fine."
"Delicious poke bowls and huge portions. We ordered three bowls for our family of 5 (3 younger girls) and everyone loved it..A friend recommended coming here for lunch...it was great recommendation and location was easy to get to. Small inside so no seating but can get take out and sit outside or just take it to go. Friendly staff and services. Variety in the menu to choose from. Options to create your own poke or select from their menu. Choose your base - rice/noodles, salad or burrito, then proteins, sauce, mix-ins and toppings.. There is also sushi option if you please.... Easy peasy. I had the sushi rice with chicken and shrimp with ponzu sauce and toppings...it was delicious. There's a Yelp check-in coupon for free soda for one time use. Prices are reasonable. Definitely will come again and try something different perhaps..Their zucchini noodles are a must-get! Their salmon and tuna are fresh and generous in portion. Sadly I don't pass by this place as often anymore, but I would love to go back if I have a chance. 10/10 recommend, some of the best poke bowls I've had! Great prices and big portions.My favorite poke place closed 2 years ago and I have been struggling to find a go-to since. I am so happy I tried Poke Inn tonight because I finally found my new go-to poke spot! I got takeout from here through door dash tonight. I got a regular bowl which was delicious and super filling! I did a build your own bowl overtop brown rice. I chose spicy tuna and salmon and out a bunch of toppings on top! I definitely recommend the spicy aioli as a sauce. All the flavors came together perfectly. The delivery arrived quickly and was packaged perfectly. I can't wait to order from here again soon!.I feel like it's hard to mess up a poke bowl and this one was average. I would've loved my rice a little bit warmer. I got a salmon and eel bowl, and my eel was very cold with a piece of fat running along the side that was very difficult to chew. Everything else was delicious. They have a wide variety of toppings, including healthier ones I haven't seen at other places (roasted broccoli and mushroom). The seaweed salad, crab salad, and default sauce were all very good..Poke is that one meal that makes you feel like you're making a healthy choice even when its not always healthy with all the additions lol. Nonetheless I decided to give Poké Inn a chance on one of those ""let me be healthy"" days and I'm glad I did. What sets them apart from other Poké places to me is their wide array of yummy sauce options. Lets be real, Poké on its own doesn't pack that much flavor, but add on a few sauces and toppings and the meal is transformed. With 14+ sauce options you can trial and error your way to your own favorite go-to combo. I usually opt for the salmon classic bowl with avocado, signature poké sauce, chili garlic sauce, and a splash of soy sauce. Give my signature combo a try and i bet you wont be disappointed :).Got take out from here and they have plant based options! I got the regular size Tofu Poke, I loved the roasted seaweed and seaweed salad, it was so flavorful! This is definitely my go to Poké place! My roommate had the one with tuna in it and said it's her favorite Poké, just an FYI there! Get this if you want to feel happy after a meal, it won't stuff you, it gets you satisfied. You won't get that ughh I'm so full feeling. Great light dinner or nice lunch!.Got to try out Poke Inn for a quick lunch during my visit to the city. It was a very quick wait once I ordered online through Seamless and they got my order all correct.The ingredients are all mostly fresh but I definitely had better tasting fish at other Poke establishments not sure if I just got unlucky or the sauce combination didn't work out too well. Either way for $16 it was a good deal for 3-protein bowl and hardly any wait at all since they work really fast to get the order out.Definitely a lot of Poke competition in the Theater area though so I think there might be better options around but I would give them another chance if I was in the area again perhaps to try different combination of the things the next time around.Located very close to New World Stages, this poke place serves fresh food if you want a quick meal before a show. I think it is hard for them to hear an order so make sure you speak up because I had requested zucchini noodles and ended up with soba noodles. A little bar seating inside, but you can sit outdoors in the courtyard which is very convenient. Overall the food was very good..A co-worker told me the Poké here was great with fair prices so I wanted to try it.I ordered the large size. You get a choice of three proteins and all kinds of toppings! I chose salad as my base. Ahi tuna, salmon and shrimp were my three choices. Also ordered it with their signature poke sauce (contains mayo), red onion, kale, cilantro, avocado (upcharge), scallions, charred broccoli, sesame seeds, and roasted seaweed.Delivery arrived on time, no spills. It was packed neatly. Order is correct and it's a great portion size. Filling! So happy about that. Mine was $15.95 plus tax and tip and delivery totaled $17 (promo on seamless). Sooo happy!!Everything from the seafood to the veggies to the avocado was fresh!! I definitely recommend trying this place. Very good!"
"This was some pretty good food! We wanted a bit of a variety so we ordered some things to split.  Chipotle chicken burger with onion rings: The onion rings were great! Nice and crunchy with great flavor, not greasy. The burger on the other hand, the burger was a bit of a letdown. The burger had no flavor and the bun was dry. Jax Inn panini: the cheese was great and the turkey had great flavor with everything else. The side salad was surprisingly big with great ingredients!Greek salad: The grape leaves were canned but tasty! The feta cheese was creamy and worked well with the ingredients. The salad had fresh ingredients and felt like it had some love. I would get it without anchovies, but everything else was great..When Jax is good, it can be legendary. But as many others have pointed out, Jax's execution of their business is their weak spot.Three of the last five Seamless orders from Jax arrived with items missing, items substituted without notice, or the food not cooked as ordered.It's a real shame.  Life is too short for a bipolar diner..When you don't know what to have for dinner but you didn't get to have breakfast either why not have both? You can't go wrong with anything at Jax Inn. Their orders are always correct and the food is always hot..So nice to see they're operating on 24/7 again! Their service is great, the delivery men are the sweetest and food is delicious. Ample parking if you're driving in and is great if you're hungry and just want to drive in. Food comes fairly quickly and still HOT if you choose delivery. Happy they were able to thrive despite the pandemic and seem to be doing great in this new ""normal""..Anyone driven from the north east to Florida? Well, many miles before Dillon S.C. you begin the broadside barrage of highway billboards pitching a Mexican themed establishment called South of the Boarder. Watching my prospective waitresses wandering past me gave me the same feeling, one of confusion and annoyance. So after a few accelerated hand gestures (Italians are particularly skilled at this) towards the front, and after a few tennis volleys of heads, I was properly addressed. And in that twisted mind of mine, I'm disappointed that I didn't buy enough fireworks, enough to declare war on Canada, so I could really expressed my presence as my wait continued.I've probably consumed enough homefries to write a novel about which would include my continual exasperation of never receiving them extra well done, no matter where I am dining, no matter the server, it's a worthless exercise. Jax had two peppers inside, green and yellow and that raised my spirits some because the undercooking tradition continues and another notch is scratched into my skin.Sausage links, here's another common breakfast attendee of mine, not dry inside, but not moist but a snap to the casing which I always listen for and I'll put it up to my ear along with hotdogs when I'm alone at home. Three eggs of magnificent sunshine yellow seeped slowly after a single fork tine incision and perfectly placed rye bread was set to begin phase one of absorbance, home fries securing the outer perimeter. And it's important to point out that my parents never gave me the "" don't play with your food"" speech..Food , friendly service and great hospitality by the Manager Nick , defines this place..Ask for recommendations from Mario the server‼ so hospitable and attentive service he renders. Polite and professional. Grt Filet of Sole S'wich...ah! ‼.Grt place to dine for Grt food, service n ambiance. Very clean place. Generous portions. Ask for Mario or Mateo or Tanveer for Grt service with smile! Ty Alwayz!.Omg so unorganized. Waiter going around asking who order the  drink. Food wasn't even good..I have been coming here for several years now and it is one of the best diner in NYC! I always try something new from the menu whenever I'm feeling adventurous (which is most of the times). However, my staple orders are: Chicken Cesar Salad, the Buffalo chicken wrap, Sangria, and the Piña Colada. The menu is endless and it'll be difficult to choose from because they have so many delicious options. The service is always amazing. We even came here in the midst of the pandemic in 2020. The pictures attached, were my most recent tries..Order via DoorDash to the hospital at about 3am becaise the vending machine suck here.Order the Motzo ball soup. It was so yummy and flavorful. The turkey club was huge. I had to pull it apart to eat it. It came with fries. I asked for well done and they gave me well done!I ordered an espresso to add to the coffee I was nursing for 3 hours. They sent a cup of ice, milk and sugar..Came here twice because I wanted to give a chance to this place!!!! But the food is very unpleasant!!!! The quality is very poor they definitely need more staff!!! Never saw the manager around... once you get the food no one check on you !!!! I won't recommend this place if you want to have a good breakfast or brunch or dinner !! Sadly I won't come back to this place!!!"
"I placed an order for Chicken Biryani and Garlic Naan to complement the Indian dinner I made. I was surprised that my order arrived at my place in less than 30 mins. The chicken chunks were huge so I ended up chopping them up and in mixing it in the rice. I didn't care for the sliced almonds that was used to garnish the food. I picked them out. The chicken was juicy and the rice was flavorful. The Garlic Naan was on the smaller side. I'm not sure why I received two thin pieces of flatbread instead of a big round Naan. Nonetheless the Naan was delish I just wish it was little thicker and bigger in size..Don't go hereI ordered chicken tikka masala bc I was HUNGRY AFFF. It was like 6pm and haven't ate all day. This place was interesting when I got there.... Small nostril size restaurant. You wouldn't wanna eat inside. The owner didn't even greet me and looked very busy, he complained how when customers talk too much he forgets other people's orders etc. he was just ranting about his job and that's fine but not in front of customers should he be doing this. He was the only one working there. When I ordered my food, I wasn't sure how it'd be. I got home and opened the bag. The fork and spoon were dirty like dirt on them. That's not a good sign. I opened my bag and saw that he put salad in aluminum foil. Wtf? Distasteful. The curry was hella salty and oil collected at the top of the curry. The rice was fine but something was gritty in my mouth. My bf tried some curry n rice and he got a slight tummy ache. Don't go here If you looking for quality Indian food.This place is my new favorite takeout in Kew Gardens. The food is ready really quickly, cheap, hearty, filling, and just delicious authentic Indian cuisine. There's a lot of choice for such a small kitchen with only 1 chef cooking. I will say it is more oily/buttery than anticipated but it's just soo good and dishes include tasty well balanced basmati rice and a small house salad. The portions are filling for 1 person. Could last you 2 meals if you don't have a big appetite. And if you do, you'll be full. I look forward to tasting more dishes in the upcoming weeks. I wish they had some desserts available too. The roti is really good (greasier than I thought but recommend). I also recommend the Karahi paneer. I haven't tried any meat based dishes. The eggplant dish was too oily/greasy for me but the rice absorbs part of it. The paneer palak paneer was ok but would order karahi over palak paneer!.This is my new favorite Indian restaurant. My girlfriend and I went for dinner before a movie, not knowing what to expect, and we were absolutely pleasantly surprised. The decor is humbling. It is a small restaurant. No frills, it felt like eating at someone's home. The focus, here, is on the food. We were served by Ali who seemed to do the cooking, as well. He was pleasant, made suggestions after we told him we wanted dishes to share, and asked how spicy we like our food (spicy).I ordered a Taj Mahal beer. We started with the Papri Chaat. Ali brought it over and it looked nicely prepared. He told us to mix it before eating. It was so delicious, the sauce was so flavorful with just the right amount of spice. We ate it all.We then ordered Bhindi Masala, an okra dish, and Malai Kofta, a cheese and creamy sauce dish. They were both incredible. The okras were cooked well and all of the vegetables and flavors were well proportioned - nothing was overpowering. Just spicy enough. The Malai Kofta was mild and delicious. The texture of the cheese croquettes was really satisfying and the sauce was irresistible. We wanted to save some to take home, but my girlfriend kept eating the sauce - I had to take it away from her so that we would have enough to enjoy it later on! We accompanied our meals with naan, which were classic and delicious.We will definitely return to Mehak and we plan on trying everything on the menu. It was an enjoyable experience and delicious dinner thanks to Ali..Decided to order food from this restaurant during quarantine.  My mistake.  Below average.  Definitely not Pakistani flavor.  Ordered samosas and I found a long hair in the samosa.  You could imagine how I felt! Almost threw up.  Completely lost my appetite.  Threw what ever we had left over in the garbage. I didn't trust any of the food I ordered after that point.  Waste of money..Mehak is a Kew Gardens institution. My wife and I have been going regularly since we moved to the neighborhood. It feels like you are having dinner in someone's home, and chatting with Ali while you have a few Taj Mahal's is something we always look forward to. Best korma. Best vindaloo. Best conversation..Went there recently just to try it out! Had the chicken biryani, naan and vindaloo.We went there at 7:30pm for dinner. The biryani had stale rice,, literally hard rice that could crack your teeth.The vindaloo tasted nothing like vindaloo. Naan was off the shelf pita bread you can find in a grocery store.Everything ordered was below average to disgusting! We could not even take another bite of the biryani and the vindaloo.Will not be visiting this place again.We went in, were seated, were forgotten about for a couple of minutes, and we left. The workers were just talking in the back and hanging out. It was empty & we were the only ones. Not sure if I'd ever go back..Asked a question about whether something was vegetarian or not and the guy on the phone starting yelling at me (yes I'm serious) for absolutely no reason other than I asked it he was including chicken stock when saying something was vegetarian. The rudeness turned me off so much I refuse to order from here although it's the only place by me still delivering Indian food. It's too bad too since I order in indian a lot. They lost a repeat/good customer due to a bad attitude..I'm extremely put off by my recent interaction with this restaurant. I'll preface this by saying after my interaction I went on here to read some reviews and I am not the first person that has had an unfortunate encounter with this manager/owner. I ordered on Seamless and when I received my order I noticed that one of my items (the raita) was missing. That is one of our favorite items so I called and alerted them that it was not in the bag. The man I spoke with (I assume the manager) goes on to tell me that it's in the bag because he put it in himself. I told him that it was not and that I have three containers of rice but no raita. He argues with me telling me that I do not have three containers of rice (see attached picture of my three rices) and that the raita is indeed there. Long story short after telling him I am not lying and I can even send a picture of the three rice containers he says next time I order from them I will get a raita for free (I asked if they can just come back with raita but he said no because the delivery guy had three more orders to deliver). It's interesting because when I told him that maybe he put the raita in the wrong bag he immediately cut me off and said I was the only delivery...but the delivery guy was out making three more deliveries? Hmmm but I'm the liar right hahaha. I was so upset at his inhospitable treatment towards me that I knew that I would never order from them again. I ended up calling Seamless, who called the restaurant and I was then issued a refund for the missing item. This is not the first time a restaurant has forgotten an order...it happens. However, I have NEVER been argued with about it and ultimately called a liar. The last time a restaurant forgot something I called, I was met with sincere apologies (not argument) and went on to have them take my name down and just have a credit for next time...and there was a next time because they were so nice about it! Never have I experienced such rudeness...I will never be ordering from them again. P.S. I don't mean to be catty by including this but since I am so put off by this manager's behavior I figure I'll include this part. A few minutes after placing my order he calls me to ask me the cross street of my address. I say I don't know (I really don't know I live in a busy intersection) so I wasn't sure what street he meant, he said can I find out and call him back. What hahaha?! That has never happened before...I assume he has a computer in the restaurant or a smart phone he could have looked it up. Very unprofessional but after the treatment I received later I am not a bit surprised."
"This is the best Chinese food on Staten Island.Sesame or Honey chicken have chunks of white meat. The diet chicken is the best, the house specialLo mien was great. Basil beef was delicious.Moo shoo beef is great. We order at least once a week..This place is our goto when getting Chinese takeout. The price is decent and the service is great. We recently tried the scallion pancakes and now that is a must when ordering food from here..We ordered from Red Ginger a few days ago through DoorDash and requested ""very spicy "". Our instructions were ignored completely. The dishes we ordered ""mild"" had no flavor. Also we found plastic in one of the dishes! Really subpar, albeit in the grand scheme of Staten Island's Chinese food it's about average. We're not a competitor, just Staten Islanders looking for some actually decent Chinese food..The negative reviews are false, probably from competitors.  I eat from here all the time.  Always fresh and quick.  Always tasty and too large portions. Dont know who to believe?  Try them once and see for yourself..I ordered sesame chicken white meat only I got home there's no meat literally no chicken what so ever it's literally all breading not on damn piece of chicken I cut every piece open it was literally breading dropped into a fryer and then covered in sesame sauce and sold as chicken I contacted nyc health dept nyc better business bureau it's completely ridiculous.Have ordered from here frequently and enjoyed their food. After the disgusting food delivered to me tonight, I will never eat their food again. Ordered 2 orders of honey walnut shrimp. Sauce was in a separate container and cold. Shrimp was dried out and rock hard. Like they deep fried it hours before and then refried it for our order. Inedible.  I called and spoke to owner who sent driver to pick up remainder and reimbursed the 2 dishes ($30)..Ordered a quart of thai cashew shrimp.  Husband said it looked suspiciously like a little over a pint.  Actually measured and found we paid for a quart and got 20 ounces, way short of 32 oz..  Had to ask for fortune cookies too.  This was a wonderful place that has gone downhill.  Maximizing profits while minimizing food cost..Their food is just simply one of the best on Staten Island and quick delivery. A lot of people I know rave about this place and they were right! We ordered wonton soup, pork fried rice and pork lo mein..I ordered food and drinks but only got the food delivered. Called them back and they said they will send the driver again with my drinks. Had to wait 40 minutes to get my drinks so by the time I eat my food it was colder then the drinks..This place is spotless clean, makes it so much better. Usually Chinese place are dirty but this place is really clean.plus the food is good."
"Living in Arizona for 30 years, I've had some of the best Mexican food in the southwest.  Tonight, however, I had one of the finest Mexican dinners, I've ever had in my life.  Los Girasoles impressed me  right off the bat with their salsa & cole slaw.I ordered a combo of chicken enchilada with a pork tamale, with beans & rice.  Everything was amazing...  my son had their chimichanga and it was perfect.5 stars aren't enough for the best Mexican food in the entire USA.   I highly recommend this amazing restaurant!.Excellent authentic Mexican food! Great atmosphere inside, always get the order right for takeout, and very kind staff. Cannot recommend enough!.I made the mistake of walking past this restaurant for years without going in. it's honestly the best mexican food i've ever had. I now go in one to three times a week and i get the same things every time and they never disappoint..The BEST MEXICAN SPOT . i've been going to Los Girasoles for more than a decade now and won't change it for nothing! they make the best shrimp burrito and nachos i've ever had . the service is always good and pretty fast ..Very fair prices, large portions and tasty food. We tried the potato and cheese quesadillas, burritos (I liked the al pastor, it came with pieces of pineapple) and chili chicken. Everything was delicious..Great food and great service. Good for a date night. It's a Small place but the food is awesome ..Super fast, great service, highly recommend for someone seeking authentic Mexican food..Best burrito I've had in New York ever.  From California and it is so rare to find mexican food that measures up. Wish I lived closer!.Worst cocktail drinks( there's no bartender, the waitresses make the drinks). They don't play music but they do have a jukebox which charges $1 per song. The only good thing about this place is that it's open 24/7 i heard.. but the food is not the best and if you want to drink at this place, you can't go wrong with beer. Oh and they don't serve chips with salsa which normally Mexican restaurants do...I have been coming here for years. My favorite is the cheese enchiladas! The ambiance is fun, every now and then there are some drunks that make fools of themselves singing. There drinks are pretty good. I wouldn't call it a ""kid friendly"" place but I come with my kid (17yrs old now) all the time. They tend to shut the lights off around 9, so it's an intimate place. I like the food, the service is pretty quick. I like it. If you are looking for decent music and laid back spot on a weeknight this is it."
"Fresh delicious and somewhat speedy service. Portion size was pretty darn good and pricing wasn't bad at all. I would definitely come back.I really enjoyed this family run Thai restaurant. The food was authentic, like home cooking..Good is fresh tasty and authentic ,curry delicious with duck, clams suberb in Thai spicy sauce, salad dressing bland , service good , atmosphere , blah but clean , needs nicer decor , music soft Jazz pleasant , I'm definitely going back for good food , wine and beer from Thailand ! I say try it it's good ! Food is great , went there last week orderd the Thai clams , shekels were empty ? Where'd the clams go ? Lol I don't complain , one waiter and he tried hard placed was packed ! Do I let it slide , will give it another try , if same thing happens will send back, but good is great ! Other then empty clam shells lol!.Best Thai spot around town! The drunken noodles are soo delicious! We order here quite frequently and I stopped in recently to sit down. Definitely plan to stick around a while if you're doing a sit down since things have changed since the pandemic.You really do get a good bang for your buck!.My husband and I were driving around and it was a happy accident to bump into this place! We had the pineapple fried rice and drunken noodles to share which came out 10 minutes after we ordered (place wasn't too busy) the waiter was very nice and we think we found our go to Thai place nearby!.The food was good the first time when I went inside and ate, but the second time I went the chicken satay appetizer I ordered was served partially raw. I thought to myself it was a simple mistake things do happen until one day I decided to order from them via Doordash what a huge disappointment! The basil rice with beef tasted very off as if the meat was going bad, and again the satay was raw.As the only Thai restaurant run by Thai people on Metro, this quaint restaurant definitely serves up some authentic Thai food and very close to what I've had in Thailand. For lunch they have an appetizer (choice of soup or salad) and entrée for $8.95. Their Tom yum soup, which my friend and I both ordered, was so extremely good and you can tell it's made fresh as opposed to using pre-made soup bases. I had a hunch portion sizes for lunch may not be too big so I ordered the fried chicken as an appetizer. It's your usual fried chicken that's tender and juicy with crispy skin, nothing too special. My friend ordered the red curry with chicken and I had the pad see ew with beef. The portion size for the pad see ew was on the smaller size but definitely worth it for the taste and price paid. The curry came in a medium sized bowl and was also good, it came with bowl of rice. It was pretty quiet for a weekday lunch but the staff were extremely friendly and weren't too pushy or try rush us out. I'll definitely be back!.Received delivery of Tom yum soup, was still warm when we got it it was amazing! Full of flavor and the broth was pretty light but the spices were packed with flavor. Had mushroom and green peppers in it alongside shrimp.Happy to stop in. My dish is fresh and tasty. Waiter is friendly and gives suggestions. Prices are afforavle. Easy going establishment. Not a place if you are in a rush. Come hungry and enjoy life and your dinner. We should stop being in a rush, and enjoy the now. Thank you for a lovely experience..I have been eating here for OVER 10 years and love the drunken noodle with chicken along with the pineapple fried rice. I really don't understand the three star rating. The food is great and they have me as a very loyal customer. Support local businesses during this pandemic!"
"This is your basic NYC cafeteria style joint.  Get in line, place your order, receive a ticket, pay your bill, then wait for your name to be called out.  Definitely a quick, no frills place with very limited seating. That's not to say this place is not worth visiting.  I am just trying to set one's expectations.  It was fairly crowded the morning we dropped in.  The team there is friendly and very efficient.  Most importantly, one cannot beat the prices there for a bagel.  I mean, what a tasty and delicious bargain!As we were wrapping up breakfast, the team there was starting to load up their warming trays with the lunch items..One of my go to places for a quick work lunch. There's a ton of sandwiches to choose from (or customize your own), and all of the ones I've had were all fresh and tasty. There isn't really a lot of places to sit down, but this is more of a grab and go joint.Would highly recommend placing the order ahead of time online as it can get very packed during peak hours..What: cinnamon raisin bagel(toasted), fresh fruit bowl, bacon and egg sandwich on toasted multigrain bread, scramble egg platter with bacon, potatoes and toast. Everything tasted fresh and they also have a case of beverages with different juices. Definitely hit the spot for a quick breakfast. There is limited seating inside.We came here twice during our NYC visit. Would definitely return!.Came here because of the yelp reviews and ratings.Being our first time in NY, the workers here are super friendly, patient and helpful!!With such a huge menu to choose from, we ordered a cinnamon raisin bagel, French toast, Philly sandwich, house combo sandwich and chicken parm sandwich.It took a little bit because they had to cook our order, which is totally understandable! This place gets crowded so we ordered at a good time! The French toast was good. It wasn't super eggy. It had just enough cinnamon too! The bagel was delicious! Funny tho, cause it was just a bagel, but it warm and toasted with cream cheese in the middle!!! It was so good!!! And it was big! The chicken parm sandwich was good, very filling! There was a good balance of sauce to chicken. It wasn't dry or over flowing with sauce. The house combo sandwich (it has salami, pastrami, cheese and coke slaw) actually was from yelp. I didn't see it on the regular menu. It was good too! The meats weren't too salty like some other places can be. Lastly, the Philly sandwich (roast beef w/cheese, onions and peppers - but we left out the peppers and onions). This sandwich probably could've used the peppers and onions for moisture and texture cause it was a bit dry and one noted. I think it needed the onions and peppers for the crunch, but my daughter doesn't eat those things. But she said it was good and was happy without them in it.Overall, we had a great experience and delicious meal! I would definitely recommend this place!!!.Our staple breakfast joint while in NYC. So grateful it was on same block as our hotel. Great bagels, b'fast sandwiches and fresh fruit. Such a great way to start the day!!.Good quick breakfast and lunch spot. They are fast and the food is reliable. I love coming in the morning for bagel sandwiches on H&H bagels or ordering a sandwich for lunch. Service is efficient and they never get my order wrong!.Cute place, so glad we found itA friend and I were looking to get a legit NY bagel and this place does not disappoint.This place has everything from breakfast to dinner options.  Their fresh salads look delicious! This bagel sandwich was simple but so good! I also liked that their service is quick. Definitely will be trying a salad ASAP!.Very nice. Busy in the morning but fast services. I got the errything bg with lox spread and sesame with plain creamcheese. On point..I just moved to NYC from California so I'm still pretty new but so far Toasties is the best sandwich/deli shop I've had. They were quick to deliver my order and it was 100% accurate. I will definitely order from them again and try another item off their menu. I also liked they had diet Dr. Pepper. Ha, you rarely see that. Yummy, good job Toasties!"
"Competition in the Chinese bakery market is stiff. The look and goods all seem similar, so how to distinguish between the bad, mediocre, and the good? I've been going to Chinese bakeries my whole life. While I haven't sampled everything at this establishment, I can say that Into-the-stratosphere-and-beyond-amazing are the mochi ball with green bean paste. The sticky rice is so fresh, soft, gooey, and smooth in consistency. To the extent that sticky rice can ""melt,"" this nearly does it. The green bean paste in the middle is perfectly sweet and rich, without being overwhelming. The white mochi with crushed peanuts is good--same spectacular sticky rice--but with a hint of salty and sweet with the nuts. The other flavor offering is mango, which I have yet to try. These soft yet hefty babies are $1.25 each. The coconut pastry and red bean-swirled bun are also good, though less distinguished as the mochi balls. The date cake (nian gao) typically eaten during Chinese New Year was also solid. Prices are similar to other bakeries, but quality really stands out. There is another Dragon Bay bakery about two streets down around 56th Street on 7th Ave. Avoid this one. Similar prices and offerings, but not as fresh. You'll notice fewer patrons there--a sign of less popularity--and the scary B NYC Department of Health rating..Typical 8th Ave bakery. They have all the standard fare (my favorite is the pork chop sandwich). But what I like them the most for is their red bean ice drink. Sure, it's a little on the sweet side because of the condensed milk, but they'll blend it for you and the split red beans really add a ton of flavor to it..Wonderful bakery! I got a red bean pineapple bread to try first, and then I came back after we finished food hopping to get some bread for the next few days. I went back for another red bean pineapple bread, a normal pineapple bread, and a coconut cream bread; each item was $1 except for the pineapple bread, which was $0.90 (prices all including tax). The first time we went, there was a box of matcha cake for $3.75, but I didn't get it then and they were all gone when I got back! The bread is really chewy and fresh, and the pineapple top was crunchy and delicious. The bread was still good the next day, even though the crunch went away and became soft. There was also a really good selection of bread and (Asian) cookies!.Ah!!!...the smell of delicious Chinese breads and desserts. I love that smell every time I walk into one. Dragon Bay Bakery is a chain bakery all over 8th avenue. Some people say its the best bakery in 8th avenue. I have to say it is a good bakery. Many breads, desserts, and drinks to choose from the menu. Pick anything that your heart chooses. Best of all.. it is CHEAP!!!Heart decided I wanted:1. A small cup of hot milk tea. Good balance of milk and tea. Very satisfying drink to warm yourself. 2. A Fried Fish Fillet Bun. Maybe an ordinary fish fillet bun, but it sure is a tasty one. 3. A Char Sui Bun. Delicious roast pork. The sauce was great. 4. 2 Egg Tarts. The crust was soft and flaky. The custard was very smooth and silky. Great!!!Add that all up...$4.25. Barely broke the bank. Made my tummy all happy..Stopped here for a snack and drink on a hot summer afternoon. Very glad that I did! I got a Vietnamese cold tea that was sweet, smooth, and very refreshing in the heat. I splurged and got a huge red bean pastry as well. The crust was buttery and flaky, and the red bean paste was addicting. Very cheap overall for a filling meal -$3.75. Will definitely be back to try more of their pastries and drinks!.This is my go to place for Chinese chiffon cake.   I usually get it filled with all pineapple.   I've had some of their baked goods but not many.   Trying to watch the waistline...lol.   The workers are nice.  If I would need any baked goods or coffee from 8th ave, I would go to this store only, seeing that along 8th avenue, it's filled with Chinese bakeries..Ok so this is the kind of flakiness and sponginess and crust I'm talking about ! Nice !.Ordered $188 bday cake for my daughter's 7 old birthday party. It is 3D bear cake. The cake is covered with coffee cream. Are you losing mind? put coffee cream on the child's cake??!!.What if everything I touched turned to gold? Or an Asian bun? Priorities! My go to bakery whenever I'm in eight avenue... This place is a chain!I think Dragon bay Bakery has really good fruit cakes...they do fresh fruits and canned fruit cakes...personally i like fresh fruits...i like my fruits to be fresh and sweet...and this place makes it pretty tastefully... and pastries are pretty good but limited to seating's...since this place is so popular can be overwhelming...always crowed during breakfast and lunch.. For fresh pastries this is the place to go...but the prices are on the high side...offer an assortment individually wrapped....for lunch they also offer those big buns which is like a meal itself....has an egg...meat and vegetables in a steamed bun/fresh baked bun...yumm.I come here all the time but bakery taste very doughy only a few stuff taste good one item tasted like cat food which is called ""fried dumping"" most Chinese bakery I've been to taste very doughy idk why maybe they don't know how to bake or they use some sort of fakes who knows"
"-The pho is really tasty (It's in the name)-The waiters are nice and very attentive-The tea with condensed milk isn't too good-The spring rolls are okay, but make sure you eat them with the lettuce-Overall I had a good time and enjoyable meal here-Bussin.This was the saddest Banh mi I've ever had.This review is for the Pho Grand counter in Essex market.There were maybe 3 shrimp in this sandwich sliced long in half. The content was skimpy, grilled shrimp cold.The bun was soggy and worst of all it was just bland.I was the only one waiting there and this crap took 15 mins to make with pre made cold shrimp?? The counter guy looked at me awkwardly as the guy in the back was busy fumbling around with the delivery orders I just knew this was a mistake. Lesson learned.Should have gone to Forgtmenot for a shrimp Po Boy.It's a little more price wise but really good and comes with a boat load of fries..5 star quality food in a classy hole in the wall. We were exploring the LES and stumbled into this spot for some good grub. We had the Brisket Pho Bowl and the Chicken Fried rice (given the compliments of the best my friend had had in the city). And the entire meal was very affordable. If I'm in the area I will definitely go here again..stopped by Pho Grand and grabbed a cup of iced Vietnamese Iced Coffee (dark roast coffee + condensed milk + ice) as a rainy day treat, a couple of weeks ago. Pho Grand is a casual Vietnamese restaurant with a clean medium-sized dining room. Grand Pho serves a menu of Vietnamese noodle, rice, and meat dishes. the iced coffee was made fairly quickly. the coffee had a smooth sweet espresso flavor with touches of bittersweet from the dark roast beans. the condensed milk provides all the sweetness without being overly sweet. this caffeinated pick-me-up lifted me out of a dreary rainy day funk $4ish + tipstaff are quick but a little gruff. drops mic cuz i am percolating i outzzz.Visited on a Saturday afternoon, place was clean. Servers were not so nice but I'm kind of used to it at some pho places. I ordered the combination pho and spring rolls. I didn't really like how servers kept looking at me, pressuring to order quickly. But! Who cares. Food was good.Pho-  It tasted like a typical flavor enhanced pho with in South where I grew up. I personally like it, but I can tell why some people wouldn't like it because of the artificial taste. Spring roll- nothing too special. Lettuce, noodle, shrimp wrapped in a rice paper, served with peanut sauce. Nut allergy alert on this. It was fresh. Very very typical spring roll.It was cold yesterday but not frigid outside.  The best thing to warm the soul on any wintry evening is pho.  I ordered the #1 Big bowl and a hot cup of espresso.  The Big bowl comes with so much fixings, slices of raw veal (this is normal and how it's serve authentically), slices of sauteed beef, and bits of tendons and other cartilagey goodness.  I recommend it because it's full of noodles.  The pho in the Big bowl reminds me of tasty flavors: sweet, salty, spicy (if you add srichacha...spelling?), sour (lemon wedge to drizzle sour goodness).  I loved it!  I wanted to drink the pho broth, but of course, that's not what you do here.  Lol.   I really enjoyed my hot espresso also.  It came with a huge amount of condensed milk to balance the richness of my espresso.  I loved it!  I would totally return!  I went with my friend who comes often!  And it was so much fun!.I love that they serve their take out pho orders in the wide black plastic bowls whereas most other places serve them in the tall quart containers. Their bowls make it so much easier to eat in.Their prices have not really changed and as a result, attract more customers during these hard times. I must say though, I've always felt like their portions were smaller than other places. It does not fill my tummy quite as well and I'd have to snack on things afterwards but that's ok.Since long ago, I've liked the kind of vermicelli they use in their pho. I feel like they're smoother than others but that might just be me.Their spring rolls however, are not my go-to. They are petite. The wrappers make up 70-80% of the spring roll itself and does not have that nice crisp to it. I personally prefer the spring rolls at Nam Son..A small group of friends and I were craving Vietnamese food one cold night in Manhattan. We decided to settle on Pho grand because it was nearby and had a menu that suited everyone's taste.Instead of getting pho, I decided to just get the shrimp lo mein because I didn't want to eat something too heavy. I thought that the lo mein was just okay to be honest, and I'm sure I have had better and worse. However my friends did enjoy their Pho, so I would recommend getting that if you plan to visit the restaurant.The outdoor seating set up was nice but they do have limited seating so keep that in mind. Also, bring cash because that is all that they take.Overall I did enjoy my time at Pho Grand, and see myself coming back..Always my go-to pho place in Chinatown. The best price for the quality and taste. The closest to the real thing that I can find in NYC..5 stars. I love this place, I've been coming here for years. It's in my top 3 favorite places to eat. It's reasonably priced and always constant quality. I highly recommend any of the pho soups and the crispy spring rolls are amazing.  This place is a must."
"Tried this place on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. I know it's specialty is chicken but I got the seafood meal, for only $6.50 (after tax) you get crab cakes, fish, coleslaw, crumbed prawns and fries. The mini crab cakes were delicious, the fries were nice and crunchy (well drained of oil and fresh), the coleslaw also had a good texture (fresh) and I was amply supplied with tartare sauce. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the pieces of fish, which was mostly batter and tasted like the generic assortment straight out of the frozen foods section at your local supermarket. Otherwise very happy with the value for money. They have a lot of great promotions on at the moment and a menu with great variety. This surprisingly spacious, there's a second area to the restaurant that is all seating, the restaurant has very well adhered to social distancing requirements and looks very clean.** advice to those ordering off of uber eats, if you're in the area you are better off going in person. For the exact same meal I ordered today for $6.50, I saw for $10.99 (BEFORE tax).Happy eating all! Stay safe :).I was commuting home and I had this craving for Fried Chicken so I ordered from a spot closest to my home that had the least delivery time. I placed my order en route so when I arrived home the food would be there. I ordered the two piece Combo. The chicken hit the spot it was crispy and cheap, I chose Cole slaw so I can have my daily vegetable consumption and feel somewhat healthier. Then I had a bottle of ginger ale to wash it all down and to prevent additional bloating that may take place as a result of consumption. I ordered through UberEats and delivery was on point. I didn't take a picture of the order because I was very hungry..If they're busy and you have even a relatively large order almost guaranteed they'll forget something. Just had 4 orders and they managed to get almost all of them wrong. Took 4 tries just to try to call them back only to tell me that I should come back tomorrow and tell them. Doubtful they'd honor that. A lot of disappointed customers inside, including someone who was there before me but still didn't get her food even when I left. They need a better system..It's good , got the $5 box with two chicken tenders , fries , had to ask for cup for soda and was supposed to have a cookie but didn't. Not too salty , there's locations opening up right near my job AND my home so I'll go back . My son and his fiancé eat halal.They really improved their overall service, I would come back here now as the food is made much more fresh and faster. The staff is much more organized too.If you eat in here then it's good but never order for take out, as their staff that runs this place is incompetent and all over the place. Like seriously don't serve all the orders at one and take your goddam time sheesh. There food is 10 outta 10 I wouldn't lie about that. But the staff is stupid because they forgot to pack a 4 piece chicken into our order. And if you want to call them in advance good luck, then assholes took out their fool line to save their precious money for themselves . Never go to this Texas location. There are soooo many better Texas locations around the area..Looks it's fast food so I'm not giving them 5 stars. But they definitely earned 4. The chicken is super crispy and juicy and delicious. Mom and I tried a number 12, splitting it half regular and half spicy. 6 pieces total. Whoooo the spicy sure has a kick. I tasted it and at first thought it was mild but I was very much mistaken. Delicious but I'll stick to the regular. We both really enjoyed the chicken. And it was piping hot and stayed hot to the last bite!!My daughter ate the 2 sides we got with the meal. Mac and cheese was pretty good. The fries were ok. A little boring to be honest. They have a soda tower for free refills. That's nice but typical today for fast food places. But the crazy thing is this place is packed!! We got here at 9:15 at night. Got on line with 6 people ahead of me. And the line has stayed strong. It's 10 now and the place is still popping. Clearly it's good. Enjoyed my meal. Definitely recommend. Will be back!.I was quite impressed. I was expecting a KFC clone and this was so much better. I ordered spicy chicken and it was very spicy. The flavor permeated the chicken. It wasn't only in the crust. I got a wing, a thigh and a leg with a side of fries. The fries were nothing special but the chicken was juicy and as good as I've had anywhere. We arrived after 9:30 and the restaurant was full. It stayed fairly full The whole time we were there. I would say the majority was take out but the tables were full also. I will definitely come back..The food is best but I only minus one star because I want to inform management that I m regular customer n all staff professional and food good but since my last few visits I observe that in this serious covid time there it is not that precautions . Two times I notice guys standing near counter don't wear mask even in those both time recently two days back too they r allowed in without mask plus go sipping near food n sitting on counter. This week camera should be checked. It's really dangerous I hv decided not to buy any thing that day I purchase two fish sandwich n mash potato bought home but didn't eat. Because guy working in front was also not covering his nose with mask even he was direct in public dealing. Pls cover plastic near counter n don't allow any one to come in without mask. It's only precautionary suggestion..Came here to satisfy my craving for fried chicken. I like coming here because their chicken is crazy spicy and some pieces are spicier than other pieces. The place does get busy and packed very quickly so expect to wait. I don't mind waiting for freshly made chicken, I would come back here again if I am in the area..DONT ORDER ONLINE!The food was pretty good for a local chicken spot.  The spicy chicken is actually....spicy!  The fries were good too as all the food seemed freshly prepared.The only negative is that when ordering through GrubHub, I paid $7.29  for 2 pieces of chicken, and an extra $2.79  for fries.  When I get to the store, they have a 2 piece combo with fries included AND a drink for only $6.99. when I asked the cashier why I paid more online he only shrugged his shoulders.  I called GrubHub and they're refunding me the difference.  Still, very annoying to see a price difference like that.  If you're ordering through GrubHub please realize they're charging you more money.  Pretty much everything I saw in the restaurant was cheaper than through GrubHub."
"How did I miss this place? I walk past it all the time when walking to Costco/Target. I've definitely been missing out. I want to give it more stars!!I had the hot honey wings, bf had the jibarito, we shared the truffle fried. Yum, yum, yum!!!! Owner was so cool. Told us the background of their story. Loveeeee the DR/Tunisia fashion!Next time, I'll go back for drinks. Sadly, we are doing ""dry March""..I've been wanting to come here since the summer but never made it. Well I finally made it today and unfortunately the establishment is closing. I hope they find a new place or change their minds. I got the chicken of course and it was amazing and very crunchy which I loved. Had a side of fries as well and they were seasoned perfectly.  The atmosphere was lively today despite the circumstances.  Cool place and I am wishing them all the best..Barcha is a great little spot in the neighborhood! The food was really delicious and perfect if you want something fried.I gave it a 4 stars because the atmosphere was just okay - it felt like a typical sports bar (but very clean!) and the menu was really small. This is definitely a place if you're craving something fried.The food also came in to-go boxes, which we thought was a little weird, but the portions were large so it was easy to just take the box if you had leftovers.Overall, a nice option if you want a burger and fries and a beer!!.* REVIEW OF FOOD ORDERED THROUGH UBER EATSOverstuffed Empanadas : good but not what I expected. I thought I would break this thing open and it would look like the cheesiest slice of pizza. Red sauce and all. Instead, It was more like pizza flavored mozzarella sticks. There wasn't any sauce or oozy mess. Just orange colored cheese. Tres Leches : good ! It wasn't crazy sweet either. The whipped cream on top was light and the sponge just crumbled away with each bite. Bacon truffle fries : Never thought I'd say this but the bacon wasn't necessary. It was actually taking away from the dish. It was flabby and sweet. Def a miss for me. The fries however were great. Crisp but soft and warm on the inside. The truffle taste is there. Fried chicken plantain : That avocado sauce went perfectly  ! The chicken was very crispy and perfectly seasoned. The plantains were also done right.  It definitely needed the tomato because it was kind of dry but great dish. I'd order it again. @BBEDU.Great service and the wings are incredible! I recommend the empanadas as well. I am glad they sell the harissa hot honey separately and can't wait to cook with it soon!.This restaurant does Latin, Mediterranean, and comfort food fusion in a unique and thoughtful way that I've never seen before. The fried chicken jibarito (pictured) is crispy and flavorful, the burger is a solid addition to the neighborhood, and the candied bacon truffle fries are a super indulgent snack. I really want this new, family-owned business to become an East Harlem staple. Can't wait to try the harissa honey chicken wings!.Little family restaurant. Beautifully decorated and fun ambiance only complements the delicious food and perfect drinks. Will definitely come back..We ordered delivery today as part of Metro Hope Church's virtual cash mob event along with Union Settlement. It was great to hear how Barcha is giving back to the community, delivering meals to hospital workers. The food was delicious as well. We had the Barcha burger on soft brioche, the bacon egg and lettuce sandwich and the empanadas (beef). Our favorites were the empanadas and the fries! Fried things usually don't deliver well but they did a great job!They also were quick about correcting an order mistake we made. Will definitely be back in the future!.my experience was amazing I reached out to have a remembrance dinner in honor of my mother and sol made sure that mine and my families experience was perfect she honored everything I wanted and more food was amazing.Loved this place! Came here for a cute birthday brunch with my friends and fam. Prices are $15-$20 and the food is absolutely delicious! Would highly recommend!"
"Once upon a long time ago, I had such a wonderful meal here. The food was excellent (I still think about these oysters, even though I generally hate shellfish) and the service was *professional* - I'm not usually one to pay for ambiance, but I would for this place and I hope it reopens soon!.Great place for date nights. The service was really nice and the lady was so lovely. We got the burrata to start, then the bolognese. For mains we shared a ribeye and had fries for sides. Everything overall was great..I came during restaurant week and my review is based on that experience. I don't frequent steakhouses and the prices on the regular menu are more than I typically spend on dinner but after the food I had, I could be convinced to come back at full price! The dining area is very classy and has an upscale vibe. The lighting is soft and servers are all dressed well. Again, I don't do fine dining at steakhouses often so maybe this is typical but I felt fancy  Service was very attentive and on point. For appetizers, I had the braised BLT bite and my friends had the soup. The texture and flavor of the pork belly in the BLT bite was incredible. I would get an entree sized serving of this if it was offered. My friends both enjoyed the soup very much as well. For my entree, I went with the salmon. It was cooked perfectly and was my favorite entree of the night. One friend had the chicken and that was also cooked really well and stayed nice and juicy. His portion size was generous. My other friend got the petite filet, which was good, but definitely petite and was a tad overcooked. She asked for medium and it was definitely well-seared and closer to well. Still delicious, but she also preferred my salmon. They got the potato skins for sides and I got the haricot vert. I didn't try the potatoes but loved the green beans. Two of us got the creme brûlée for dessert and the other got the sorbet. I ate every piece of my brûlée including the mint garnish!.The food here was actually pretty great. I haven't been to a steakhouse in a long time and though it was super pricey, it was quite tasty. It wasn't without flaws: steaks were more raw than ordered and had to be sent back and the bathroom at the front is not well maintained which was shocking. But the service was great and if you're willing to spend the money, it doesn't really disappoint. I loved my steak especially with the au poivre sauce. Dessert was skippable, lobster in the spicy red stew was very nice with a bit of a kick, side dishes were fine and somewhat lackluster in their straightforwardness..Bread perfection. By now you have probably heard. Their bread is amazing. Comes to the table soft much like a biscuit consistency. Topped with garlic, poppyseeds and whatever goodness they decided to bless this carbohydrate boat with. Lather on some butter and you're in for a real treat. But save some room for the....Hotel Caesar salad- this for some reason was the STAR of the show. Even more than the bread and I loved the bread. The dressing was spot on. There croutons were razor thing so it wasn't had to eat. And the egg was well incorporated where you appreciated the taste without being bogged down by too much texture. Ny Strip- I ordered mine medium. I know, that's too overdone for most. I thought the meat was tender and flavorful. It wasn't necessarily memorable. Perhaps because it was preceded by two home run foods. But it was a solid 8/10.Sides- the mashed potatoes had good flavor but the texture was much too smooth and almost to the point of watery. The asparagus was nice but underwhelming. Desserts- despite being tremendously full I did manage to munch on the blueberry topped lemon curd tart. It was fantastic. I love lemon and this hit the spot!Service was exceedingly exceptional. Literally could not get through a couple sips before my water or wine was attended to. Excellent place for business or a nice classy meal..Knowing that this is Marc Forgiones place , I had high expectations for American Cut. Was somewhat disappointed at the experience. Came here Friday night in a group of four for restaurant week. I got the yellowtail crudo, tenderloin with hash browns side, and chocolate sundae for my restaurant week dinner. My meal was $42, and total bill for the four of us came to $216 tax and tip included. AMBIANCE:Love the ambiance here. Think classy, old school speakeasy meets trendy steakhouse. PROS:Want to start off with the bar first. I was waiting for my party to arrive so decided to get a drink first. I got the old fashioned, and I must say that was one of my favorite old fashioned that I've gotten in NYC. It's smokey, it's strong, and so smooth. These bartenders surely know their craft here. The drink was $10 since I came during happy hour, which ends at 730pm. Would come back for the bar most defiNitely! 5 stars out of 5just for the drinks and the bar. There are also $4 beer options and $6 wines for happy hour if and old fashioned isn't your scene. Now to the food: I must say the yellowtail crudo was spectacular. It's tangy, zesty, and the fish oh so fresh. The hash brown and cauliflower sides were also fantastic, they killed their sides. Portions were great. Hash browns were crispy on outside and airy and fluffy inside. The addition with sauteed peppers and onions added an extra flair of flavor to the hash browns.CONS:I was somewhat disappointed with the beef main course and dessert. Tenderloin was definitely wayyy too salty. The red wine reduction, although noble, wasn't reduced far enough and thus you can taste strong hints of wine. IMO I don't think that tastes good cause it just tasted like a piece of steak doused in wine.Chocolate Sunday wasn't special at all. The ice cream tasted like it could've came from Ben and Jerrys, it wasn't smooth, and was somewhat chalky. Felt like the sundae didn't require any technique to make as it really was a scoop of ice cream, brownie chunks, whipped cream, and a wallop of chocolate fudge. A four year old can make this, and I expected so much more coming from American Cut.Also the amount of whipped cream on the sundae was absurd. I'm not a whipped cream fan and would have appreciated that there was going to be that on my sundae.OVERALL:The bar is fantastic. The RW deal leaves more to be desired..Wow - Truly magnificent presentation as you can see from my pictures. Staff is very polite and professional. Restaurant is very comfortable and civilized. Staff truly respects customers and treats them well, this is something you don't get @ other fancy places. Finally and most importantly - the meat was exceptional and delicious. Sides were damn awesome as well too. Looking forward to returning to try this ""Pastrami Steak"" that they were bantering about. I think I will muster up the courage to do such my next time around. Thanks for a wonderful and memorable evening. A+.I came here for a private group dinner, we had a prix fixe menu that came out in batches.We were served the parmesan salad, the thick slabs of bacon, the hanger steak, the salmon, and bell evans chicken, with a smattering of pastries for desserts. The parmesan salad was fine, but I thought overdressed in the way it smothered the delicacy of the romaine lettuce. I'm not a huge bacon fan and the thick slabs are probably my least favorite. It was well seasoned, but had too much fat in my opinion. The salmon was great, definitely the highlight of the meal. It was buttery yet we could still appreciate the inherent taste. The bell evans was okay as well, nothing remarkable. There were an assortment of sides that came out as well such as roasted broccoli, creamed spinach, and another that I can't remember. This meal was not very memorable and nothing really stuck out to me as being really delicious.Overall, the food was okay, the ambience was fine. It's somewhere to go when you have someone in town who would prefer more customary American food and are not looking to be very adventurous with the palate..Pros: 1) great vibe; 2) beautiful decoration; 3) fast waiter.Cons: 1) some of food was taste bad. Potato purée was so watery, felt like it wasn't even real potato. 2) music wasn't loud enough..Pros: 1) great vibe; 2) beautiful decoration; 3) fast waiter.Cons: 1) some of food was taste bad. Potato purée was so watery, felt like it wasn't even real potato. 2) music wasn't loud enough..I went to American Cut for Restaurant Week with some girlfriends because their menu seemed like the best steakhouse for the value of what RW got you, and they had the largest assortment of options.Overall it was a really really great experience and I would definitely go again, even not during Restaurant Week! The food was WOW, the ambiance was WOW, but the service was okay. They lost a star because they messed up our dessert orders and it took quite a while for them to accommodate the change. The maitre d apologized for the situation and it was all eventually resolved.First, the bread was SPECTACULAR! I didn't take a picture unfortunately but it was like a half biscuit/half bread that just blew all of our minds. For the appetizer, I got the French onion soup and my friends got the baked potato ravioli. Both the soup and pasta were excellent, but the ravioli only had 2 little squares, whereas my French onion soup was normal size and quite delicious.For the main, we all got the petite filet, and each of ours was cooked to perfection. I am not the biggest meat eater, but I was devouring every last bite! With the main you each got to pick a side of either kale or sweet potato. I don't like kale so I chose the sweet potato, and that was another side that knocked it out of the park. Not sure what they seasoned it with, but it was the perfect mixture of sweet and savory. I'm still thinking about it the next day!For dessert, my friend and I got the Cracker Jack sundae which was amazing, and my friend got the peanut butter chocolate cake which was also excellent.We left there feeling happy as clams and stuffed to the brim. Definitely a phenomenal restaurant. Another noteworthy thing is that they have an amazing happy hour deal! It's 5-7:30 Monday through Saturday at the bar, and our wines were only $8 each, which is a steal in manhattan! They had other drinks too and really great food options for happy hour. Next time I go back I will definitely check out the full happy hour and indulge once again!"
"Five stars for the dumplings. Husband said they're better than Prosperity's at their prime (in Chinatown). I might agree. Super juicy fatty pork in a thin wrapper. $3 for 10 pan fried which is a still a good deal today. In Chinatown, Vanessa's dumplings go for $5.50 for 8 so yeah you can do the math. We also got their fj style xiao long baos but we'll pass on that next time..More like ""Meh Taste Dumpling"", sorry! I was doing a food crawl with some friends and everyone was underwhelmed. We got steamed and fried pork and chive dumplings. The dough on the dumplings is too thick. The fried ones, which I know people usually like more, didn't come out as good as the steamed, for whatever reason they just didn't fry right. There was too much meat and not enough chive, or anything else, it was so basic, like there was no effort put in. Even the sriracha didn't look quite right, kind off in color and consistency. Everything also took like 15-20 minutes to come out, not worth the wait. Same problems with the little mini pork buns. Skip this..Good and fresh dumplings for super low prices. You can also get 50 frozen dumplings for $12, perfect if you're balling on a budget. Their cheese wontons are also fantastic.This place is cash only and the owner speaks enough English to take your order so stop by if you want to support a sweet family during these hard times!.If you miss Prosperity Dumpling like I do, this place really fills the void. Perfect proportions of ingredients, delicious flavor that really gets straight to business.Wonton soup here is amazing, gorgeous, thin skinned wontons in a delicious clear broth for 1.25. Add a .75 sesame pancake and an order of dumplings, you've got yourself an amazing little meal. This place pretty much put me through my last two years of college, and I still crave it.I'm not chinese, so I always asked for the Chow Fun noodle soup and they never had it, the guy laughed one day and finally explained that it's not really something people eat for dinner! Go figure!These guys clearly work their tails off and considering the other ""legendary"" dumpling shops in NY are totally mediocre, I'm surprised that some people could come down to sunset, walk into this business, come out and give it less than 3 stars. Some people just blow my mind.Personally I don't mind getting some of the best dumplings around or a gorgeous authentic wonton soup for the price of a pack of m&m's..Greasy dumplings if you want a quick fix.  I got the boiled so it wasnt so bad. The hot soy milk was disgusting - I can taste the dirty grease from an unsanitary cheese cloth used to make the soy milk.  He only offered me the large sized soy milk in those plastic food containers.  There is a smaller size so dont be fooled. I toss 2/3 of it out because of how gross it tasted..I came here again to try their beef pancake, and it was really tasty! I really liked the flavor of it, and I think it was fried but it wasn't too oily. It was hot when we got it, which was great. Really delicious, each for only $2 including tax!Per my previous review, I've also been here for dumplings and they're not great, so skip them..I came here with a few friends and we shared the pan-fried dumplings (4 pieces $1) and an order of cabbage and pork boiled dumplings (8 for $2.50). They were both mediocre; the pan-fried dumplings weren't hot which means they were all cooked and then served later. The steamed dumplings were okay but there wasn't much flavor to the meat and the meat-to-cabbage ratio was off (too much meat). There was also only soy sauce and sriracha, no vinegar and no chili oil. Cheap, but I definitely recommend going to Kai Feng Fu down the street for dumplings instead!.This is my favorite go-to cheap tasty dumpling place in Sunset Park. If you want to eat a TON of yummy dumplings for 2 under $20, then go here. They are super fast, cash only. They also have fried kids food like chicken nuggets and fries. We usually stick to the pork & chives 4 for a $1 and get a bunch of those. The shrimp are good too but pricier. And the pork buns are ok too but they seem to run out. I also saw someone else eating fried crab sticks so I had to get those and they were really awesome so I'd get them again. They also sell huge packs of frozen dumplings if you want to make them at home. Seating isn't the cleanest, comfiest but it'll do if you're hungry and want some cheap dumplings in your tummy..Was a freezing night as hubby decided on a budgeted quick dinner. We settled into this hole on a wall dumpling place as also our first try and probably our last. Here wat we ordered:Chive and pork boiled  dumplings- this was probably the only thing we ordered that's ok.  It was juicy and the skin was not too thick.  Taste ok. Let just say I had better dumplings.  Pork fried rice-small- first bite was good and tasty. Second and third were good.  Forth and the last were mouth oily washing in my stomach. It was a big portion being a small size. I was able to shared it with hubby as he agreed it being having  too much grease!Beef pancake- grant that it was a freezing cold weather night, I didn't expect my pancake to have gotten cold that quick considering I was inside the restaurant eating it.  My pancake was cold and hard!!!Overall for $8.50 for the whole meal,  I should not have even written this review but food was really not that good in taste ood quality.  I know for $8.50 I can find better tasting food area the area.  I was not be returning back..I love their pan fried dumplings!!! And the wonton soup is a must try in the winter. I get food from here at least twice a week and the service is always fast and nice. This is the best dumpling in the neighborhood!!!.So thankful to be able to get some warm panfried handmade pork dumplings on a frigid cold night. The other restaurants even closed earlier than they usually do.Service: Order by the counter and only cash payment is accepted.Food: They offer good variety for regular Chinese breakfast items as well as small snacks and American Chinese food, e.g. freshly made rce noodles, pork fried buns, fried chicken with french fries or fried rice.Seating & Environment: A couple of rectangular tables for groups of 4-6, seating by the glass window and 1 refrigerator for self serve cold drinks. The whole seating area seemed to be a decent place cleaned intermittently.Price: All items are super affordable. E.g. 4 pork dumplings - $1 on 1/6/18"
"The spot was chosen from a suggestion on Google, and I'm glad we came! The vibes were really nice. I was craving charcuterie and wine. It's quite romantic and dimly lit. The hostess was also super cool. Everyone was incredibly friendly.We had 2 glasses of wine per person and shared this meat platter. I think it was around $35 and there was a good amount of items on it! As always though, eating cured meats and cheeses out is expensive (especially if you want more drinks!). I'm glad we treated ourselves and I would recommend this place for a date or a night out with friends..Just a short walk from Chelsea Piers, we came for a quick dinner.  They had indoor dining available and about 3 small tables outside. Their outdoor set up is no frills with no tents or decorations. Just tables on the street.  We each ordered a main course...Chicken Shish ($23): 4/5. Not bad but there really wasn't enough chicken to make it a main course. Would've been nice if they served with carbs.Artichoke Flatbread ($17): 2/5. There was a very strong cheese (?) taste. It was overwhelming and way too strong. I couldn't eat it after 2 slices.  However, the presentation was very nice and portion was big.Ricotta Meatballs: 3/5. Nothing special. It's just marinara sauce and 5 meatballs. Again, wasn't filling. We did really enjoy the complimentary pita bread.  Aside from that, I wasn't impressed at all especially for the price.  We were still hungry after. The food didn't blow our minds either..Cute spot. Excellent service. We started with the cheese cigars. To me they were a little too salty for my liking, but they were good. The Perogies were by far the best. Really good. We then had the chorizo flatbread.  It was a little dry, but I liked the crust. It was hummus and chorizo. The drinks were good. A nice spot..Came here for an early dinner while waiting for my son nearby. Good service, good food and very good drinks. It's a small place but nice for drinks and a light bite to eat..Came here with a party of 4 for drinks. We ate at the outdoor dining option - brrr it was a cold day. They brought out a heater for us though, which slightly helped. I appreciated the happy hour special of $8 house wines (before 6pm) with my friends! We also got a plate of cheese cigars which were actually super good and hit the spot with the melted hot cheese on a cold day. Great service that checked in on us often despite us being the only ones seated outside. If not for a 4pm pre-dinner visit, would be down to try some of their other cool plates! Great vibes inside - very homey and comfortable..TLDR: Came with a party of 9 with plenty of seating. Food was hit or miss overall amongst everyone but overall not satisfying. Go for the chorizo flatbread (has a homemade taste that I enjoyed). Wouldn't come again. Service was uncomfortable.We booked a table of 9 and came in, seated at a high table. They were very accommodating with seating which we truly appreciated. So far the ambience of the restaurant was beautiful (fireplace seating, bar, etc). We were surprised and pleased to see that we were given menus on tablets. So far the restaurant did not seem packed maybe another 8 people were there.Food:I ordered the Chicken Shish, but sadly never got my order because the waiter wrote me down for a medium cooked fillet. Mistakes happen, I get it. But 17 people are in the restaurant and he went over our orders before putting them. Fortunately my friends allowed me to try their dishesChicken shish- the chicken was dry and lacked any taste. I can't say it only tastes like chicken but I can't say it impressed my palate in any way. I tasted no truffle that they claimed to marinade in.  There was nothing special about the chicken and I've made better chicken at home. My friend had the sides and he disliked the mushrooms the most (but I can't vouch for that).Fillet mignon-It was a great cut of meat and was tender and juicy. But the execution of this cut of meat was a shame. Both my friend and I agreed it was under seasoned before it was cooked. We agreed it tastes as if it were boiled (because it was under seasoned). Only the freshly ground salt and pepper by the waiter helped. The mashed potatoes and spinach were good just nothing impressive. Well seasoned and tasty.  The Chorizo flatbread: This was probably the star of all of the foods I tried from my friends. This flatbread reminded me of some wholesome home cooked cuisine. Delicious, savory and well seasoned. The hummus complemented the chorizo incredibly well. If I had to come back I would get this. One friend got the burrata salad which she liked and one friend got a cocktail and said it was just ""ok"" and quantified it as a 4 to 5 out of 10.I got to try the lava cake and ice cream which were basic but delicious. I liked the vanilla ice cream the most. It was tinted yellow and we joked it looked like mayo or honey mustard but it tastes very rich and homey.The restaurant provided pita bread and a hot sauce that you get at pizza Restaurants's. The bread was great the sauce was not impressive. He gave it in the middle of our main course as opposed to during when we waited for our orders to come in.Service: I can't say that it was bad service. More so it was just too invasive and straight out uncomfortable. Screwing up my order was one thing, but we all noticed that the waiter would come back to the table EVERY 2 MINUTES, look over our heads at the table and removed plates, a pepper shaker (I'm not even joking), etc. It seemed like we couldn't even enjoy ourselves as a group because he kept coming back and reaching over to grab a plate from us the second we took a last bite. Maybe he was rushed, but I would rather he tell us as opposed to this ""hovering"" routine. The upside from this was we at least had our waters filled regularly. The waiter was also very patient and very flexible when it came to splitting the bill (my friends fault for screwing that up).Overall: this experience left me dissatisfied. Great ambience but disappointing food and service with good intentions but bad execution. Some improvements would need to be made to get me to come back, but so far I'll have to wait and see..Found this place on Yelp, and went on a Wednesday night. It was decently crowded, but not the overbearing type. The host asked us if we were just drinking or eating as well and escorted us towards to back for a dinner table. We were given menus- which were tablets (super cool) and served water right away. Our waiter check in on us until we were ready, and even made some suggestions. He later served us fresh warm bread and sauce. We ordered a chicken shish kebab dish, beet salad, and the artichoke and arugula flatbread. The food was a 10/10. The food came all at once, and we shared our plates. The beet salad was fresh and light, which complimented the seasoned chicken nicely. The chicken was cooked perfectly, with a little bit of char. My favorite dish was the artichoke flatbread. It was cheesy, crispy and delicious. My friend ordered the drunken mule and said it was deliciously fresh with a citrus taste! She loved it! Would come back here again to try some of the different appetizers they offer. Want to try the cheese cigars next time!Only downside, it can get very loud and hard to speak, but overall good service and great food..Inside was super hot. I will not come back. They didn't inform us about specials and I was confused about the charges. The happy hour is saying beers are $6, and that was actually not true. We were charge the full price..This is a nice little place in Chelsea, with a bar that seemed full of ""locals""  and a dining room further back.  Avoganoush was an interesting mix of eggplant and avocado (get it?).  Negroni was spot-on..After a productive cross-functional meeting in Manhattan, my coworkers had a great opportunity to bond over lunch. We decided that we were in the mood for Mediterranean and this place was within walking distance from our building. We order Avogannush for the appetizer which came with plenty of pita bread to share amongst the four of us. This kept us busy until our chicken shish came out for the main course. All of us ordered the same dish and everyone was happy with their choice. There was plenty of food for our meal and probably could have been split into two meals if we weren't so hungry."
"4.5 staraAwesome and Perfect thin crust pizza . Right amount of cheese and sauce.  For a second i thought it would be dry but it was perfect!  I took off  half a star for the sour service from the register girl.  I think she just finished with a bad phone call or something and the soda machine wasn't working right.  The Pepsi came out too watery.Ordered a chicken caesar slice and I have no complaints. Probably one of the best ones I've had. The guy who worked in the front was so nice, they didn't have any available so he went out of his way to make me a slice. And it was soooo worth the wait. It was awesome!.Definitely one of my go to pizzerias on the blvd. The food is really good and they have great family specials for less than $40. I docked a star however because some of their prices can be kind of ridiculous - $9 for a small house salad with only croutons and onions? I suck up the price only because I'm OBSESSED with the house vinaigrette. I recently tried their chicken parm hero and fell in love. It was so flavorful, not drenched in sauce and the bread was perfectly toasted. I've never had issues with their delivery service and the staff is always friendly. I will say that the food usually tastes better when I eat it at the restaurant as opposed to having it delivered..I love love love their slices here!!!!  I had to attend corporate training for 2 weeks in College Point, Queens (which seems to mainly have ASian food), and once I stopped in here, for lunch, I came back every single day for their Pizza!  The slices are the perfect NYC style goodness!  Just the right amount of crispness on the bottom, perfect Grande pizza cheese, not greasy, not burnt.  Just right!  The people working there (especially Tina. ;), are super friendly and accommodating!  The place is cute as well!   Definitely not a dump!  There are probably 10-ish dining tables, clean bathrooms, a nice sized menu (which I'm sure has other great Italian food, but I simply got hooked on the pizza!!!).  And u can also grab a beer or glass of wine!  The endless construction on all of the College Point infrastructure makes the traffic & parking a bitch, but worth it!.Ordered a Baked Ziti Lunch and Penne ala Vodka Lunch. The Penne ala Vodka was too sweet. But the Baked Ziti was pretty good... until I ALMOST ATE A PIECE OF METAL. I called them and they said it was probably a Brillo pad... So I'm guessing this has happened before. I don't know what a piece of a Brillo pad was doing in my food. They offered to send me a new one instead of giving me a refund... I mean I guess I'll take it but I'd rather have a refund... Kind of scared of eating their food again after I almost ingested metal...Update... they came with a new one order and apologized profusely... They said it's never happened before but still, why is their pasta anywhere near where the Brillo pads are??? Kind of still traumatized...but whatever....Delivery took over an hour and a half for 3 slices of pizza and a baked ziti.The pizza came cold- literally cold...The baked ziti was piping hot- but again the pizza was COLD...Sucks I have to wait an additional 15 minutes now to heat it up after waiting over an hour and 30 min. For 3 slices and a baked ziti... I am a 6 minute drive via waze... what happened ?!??.If I could give zero stars, I would. Absolutely not a fan and nothing will ever change my mind. Management treats their employees like trash, despite them being the only helpful & friendly ones. I've heard nothing but TERRIBLE things. Accusations of sexual harassment, inadequate customer service, etc. The management and overall business is a complete and utter cluster fuck. The owners of this pizzeria don't care about their employees living rights, or have any decency to respect their employees and customers. I have personally seen ""bosses"" scream at their employees in front of an abundance of people, with absolutely no shame. I have also heard homophobic remarks on 2 separate occasions. These people are rude, dirty, and their food is disgustingly (literally) overpriced. It's NYC, people. Get your pizza from a business that deserves it!.I met up with some friends from work for lunch in College Point and we decided on Mamma Luciana's.Mamma Luciana's is a small restaurant but spaced efficiently to allow for a good amount of indoor seating.The restaurant was very clean and neatly decorated too.We started with the Calamari Fritti (Fried Calamari) and this venerable starter was executed spot on.- The breading wasn't too thick and fried to a nice crisp without being oily.- The calamari was still tender and very fresh.- Marinara dipping sauce was a nice chunky texture with both sweet and tart flavors.My entree was the Rigatoni Con Mellenzana and, no joke, this was one of the best pasta dishes I've enjoyed in my life!Mind you, I do not eat a lot of Italian food, so take that under consideration.- Rigatoni was perfectly al dente having a pleasant slight bite.- Plum tomato sauce was slightly chunky; a texture I really enjoyed and it allowed me to taste the freshness of the tomatoes.- The fresh basil leaves were really fragrant and herbaceous.- However, the truly special part of the dish was the Ricotta and Mozzarella.The ricotta was so creamy and lush, with a decadent milky flavor.Mozzarella was equally awesome also having a notable milky flavor, smooth texture, and just a hint of salt which enhanced the overall taste.In hindsight I wish I ordered the dinner sized portion!My friends ordered the Linguini with Clam Sauce in Red Sauce and Seafood Linguini respectively.I did not get a chance to try their dishes, but each really enjoyed there food; as evidence one friend finished his Seafood Linguini and the other almost finished his Linguini with Clam sauce.Keep in mind both of these dishes were pretty large portions too!Each remarked on how well their seafood proteins were cooked, and also on the tasty marinara sauce.Finally, service was excellent as the woman who waited our table was so friendly, attentive, and quite funny; as we all had some brief funny conversations with her about various topics.What a great surprise to enjoy such delicious Italian food in College Point of all places!.Nice food! But they should serve you more for the pricey amount you pay. Customer service? Can do better..Vodka mini pizza was amazing But the garlic nuts had way to much garlic on it And I ordered a cannoli and it wasn't given to me during delivery. And then I had to wait TWO HOURS for them to bring it to me. After I already waited one hour for the delivery. And then they don't even give me something extra for my troubles or anything they just give me one melted cannoli that's been rolling around in his car for 3 hours -_- Wouldn't order from here again, would choose one of the many pizzarias in the area."
"Super fun place! I came here after my friend and I went to skyscape and they actually have live music playing in this sort of bar like seating. They have some tables on the sides of the room but they're maybe only five or six of them. you mostly would sit at the bar. We ordered six shots of vodka and the waitress was kind enough to give us recommendations but they really do have some interesting flavors and we wanted to try a bunch of them. I loved the ginger and pineapple but couldn't really stomach the garlic haha. They come with a few accoutrements for flavor and palate cleansing. In order to help soak up the alcohol we had some dumplings as well we tried the beef dumplings as well as the potato dumplings and I highly recommend the beef ones. Very well prepared and extremely delicious. The bartender is fun approachable and friendly and definitely does a lot to liven up the mood and the place. For dessert we tried the cheese blintzes and I would always get these. They are The best combination of cheese sweet and salt and they come together really well in the crepe..We stopped here for dinner not expecting a lot, but it was actually great.Food:Gravlax with potato pancakes - deliciousMushroom julienne - I was not expecting cheese, but this was really good, tooDumplings - we went with beef, also very goodCrab cakes - substantial portion and good flavor, but I would like a little crispier outsideDrinks:Polish Bull - not something I would want every day, but it was good. It's basically an adult juicebox.Garlic pepper & dill vodka - good, but the garlic really overpowered any other flavor that might have been in there. I probably wouldn't go for it again.Horseradish vodka - amazing. If you like horseradish, you'll love this. It was very sippable and had a very strong horseradish flavor. The horseradish really takes away any bite that the vodka itself might have and instead it's all horse.Service:Our waitress was nice and the food came out fairly quickly but spaced out enough that we could make good progress on one dish before the next one came..This place is fantastic. The dishes on the menu are traditionally Russian, and the chef clearly has a Russian background, because this food tastes home-cooked. I had the Chicken Tabaka, which was served with roasted potatoes, and green and yellow squash, and the potato dumplings as an appetizer. The Chicken Tabaka was seasoned very well (including dill, the essential Russian herb). The atmosphere inside was dark and cozy (my party sat at a table, not at the bar). It's a great place to spend an evening talking with friends. And in terms of service, the wait staff were warm and welcoming, and answered the questions my party had about the menu. However, this is one of those places where you have to get their attention to order/pay..Most people in the know are probably more familiar with the Russian Tea Room than the Russian Vodka Room, but the latter is definitely worth a visit. This place is located on the West side of Midtown, just North of numerous Broadway theatres. The bar is situated in a space much smaller than I thought it would be, but the lighting, ambience and cozy atmosphere exuded warmth. The pomegranate cosmopolitan served by the bartender was exquisite, light and refreshing. I would recommend this bar to anyone interested in Russian culture, cuisine and vodka. Also enjoyed the music of the piano-playing singer..Amazing! Loved the food, loved the atmosphere and awesome infused vodka shots. Absolutely a must for a cute and casual bar in NYC with Russian flair!.The Russian Vodka Room is like stepping into old NYC! When you walk in -it is dark and lightly lit w small lights. There's a piano and someone is usually playing and singing sweet melodies. Met up with a few friends for some vodka and yummy Russian apps. We all had a round of ginger vodka which is my favorite. I also had the Persian mule which was strong and refreshing. We had some apps the Russian dumplings are delish and great for sharing while taking shots of vodka. We also had the beef stroganoff and the crab cakes both good and and filling. Always a good time at Russian Vodka Room and last night was no different!.I wanted to have a little taste of some caviar while in NYC without spending $100s of dollars.  Welcome to the Russian Vodka Room a local gem with $5 house infused shots and a $35 plate of caviar with belinis, chopped onion, capers, hard boiled egg and melted butter.  Seriously one of my favorite meals ever ! Yep this is the hidden spot you've been wanting to discover!.Before heading to see a Broadway show, my girlfriend and I stopped at this place to have a drink.  We sat at the bar and ordered some cocktails.  We went with a Soviet Standard and a Bloody Dasha. Both of these drinks were really good.  They have some good tasting vodka here. We didn't have much time before our performance show time,  so we only stayed here for about 30 minutes; however during this time the drinks we did have were delicious and the staff was nice and friendly.  I would come back to try their food out, as their food menu looked good.  I would also like to try some more of their flavored vodkas. Maybe the vodka flight next time..This was such a fun accidental find!  It was near our hotel, so we stopped in.  There was a singer/pianist who played covers of popular songs.  The vodka selection was massive and the drinks were delicious.   This is a fun, welcoming, old school place..This was the best!! Went on a Sunday night they had live Russian music awesome staff great infused volkas try the horseradish infused volka the food was outstanding after having a crap experience at the Russian Tea Room this was a welcomed experience the prices are reasonable and it was a great time"
"Great and sweet people. Feeling special .  Very prompt and friendly.  I'm visiting here from Chicago and have family nearby.  Every time I visit I have to come here.  Judging from the previous reviews they must have done a complete makeover.  Great job!.Terrible staff and service. You order a dozen donuts and coffee, the employee does not ask which donuts you want, instead she turns around and start shoving donuts she grabs closest to her. After letting her know to stop it with the random donut selection, they forgot about my coffee and pretty much my order completely. The staff wound up serving people after me and even told the customer they ran out of sourdough bread, can another bread be substituted. Hello??? Where is MY order? You mean to tell me that making a sandwich for someone that came after me takes priority?! Unbelievable! Don't ever come in here to get ignored by the incompetent staff..If you can skip this location, do so. The workers hide in the back, and customers have to wait, for long periods of time. Then when they finally do appear, they are busy chatting away on their phone, no mask, NO GLOVES. Indian female worker touched money from customer in front of me, then proceeded to make my order. I couldn't accept it, I'd rather starve. VERY UNSANITARY and DISGUSTING!!.Ordered from DoorDash and bread was molded and they left off all of the donuts. DoorDash processed a redelivery and the new sandwich was molded as well. Disgusting! They deserve zero stars..this is probably one of the worst Dunkin' I have ever been to in my life! horrible staff, stale donuts, horrible coffee.. don't waste your time or money, they shut close this one down. TERRIBLE..I was waiting in line to order and the cashier took money for a customer and then she made my hash browns and touched them with the same gloves. Second time I've seen this happen here. Very unsanitary especially at a time like this with Covid going on..Sad state of affairs Dunkin needs to anti up and be in the game. Customers like myself will just continue to Blog on Yelp. I don't get the lazyness of this joint ? Two Indian women and a Indian guy. There must be an ego trap on the male worker who probably feels that the girls can chill in the back while he takes on long lines by himself? I was on such a line and I waited too long for just a freaking coffee. Where were the other helpers ? Bullshiting in the back and NOT ALLEAVIATING THE LONG LINE OUTSIDE!   if the manergers are listening?, please reevaluate your workers proformance when you get a chance by a team leader ! Because next time I will save money and time and take my business to 7-11 where I can make my own coffee for LESS !.If I could give this place a no stars I would but anyways I ordered a bagel with creme cheese the bagel was so hard I couldn't even bite into it I guess it was old and they toasted it and gave it to me horrible place.This is like the only Dunkin Donut in my area !!!! And it's the worst this location sucks they should just do themselves a favor and close down .... They act as if they're giving you anything free . The donuts are terrible and garbage they aren't fresh and its little .... The place is nasty there is always bums inside they refuse to clean up in the inside ... There's always tissue papers on the floor and all sorts of things ... I will never be going back here.Maybe is just the weekend workers. I don't know. But I asked for egg/sausage/cheese on croissant and tea/milk/sugar. And I got bacon/egg/cheese on bagel with tea no milk and sugar."
"First time ordering delivery from here. I ordered the vegetable tempura and karaage and they were both soo good! They lost a bit of their crispiness which is to be expected with delivery and fried food but the taste was on point. Will definitely be ordering from here on the regular.Lol! I ate some, forgot to take the pic first - but great sushi spot, reasonably priced, fresh & delicious. Can't go wrong with sushi - will satisfy your cravings and there's quick service. Side miso soup is good and the roti canani was yummy too!.Ordered a party platter of 10 assorted rolls for an event I was hosting at my apartment. Sushi Tatsu III made it very seamless for me! I placed my order the night before, and it was ready at 1pm the following day. It was packaged perfectly and ready for me to transport it on the crazy dollar van down Flatbush Avenue. My friends enjoying the freshness of it and I was happy with the restaurant's customer service. Would order from them again in a heartbeat!.I ordered the Shrimp mango avocado roll and spicy crispy shrimp roll, with thai tea. Good portion small rolls..Price is right, especially with the lunch specials. I like how they have arranged for take out pick up being contact free. The food is solid if you get sushi and sashimi. Honestly, the bento boxes were disappointing. The  salmon teriyaki was very dry and I would never get the salad over the miso soup if I had to choose..Always my go to sushi place I try not to get too technical with the order. I usually will get 3 roll special and call it a day lol. The rolls are always fresh. I'm just so use to ayce ..This place is becoming my local go-to when I have either craving sushi or ramen. It's not super fancy or amazing but the price and quality is perfect for satisfying that craving without feeling bad.I usually get their roll combinations or sashimi combination because these are the best deals. The sashimi salad was just okay, I would only get it if im absolutely graving a ice bergish salad with some fish on it... but price was it didnt feel worth it. Appetizers are decent as well. My friend got the katsu and it looked okay. I didnt try it but my friend seemed to feel okay about it lol. They are usually on time as well. I just stop by to pick up since I live close by, but the few times I did delivery its been on time and good experience as well..Stay away. This place is below par of those packaged sushi sold in cafeterias. Spend a couple of more bucks and order from KAMI SUSHI which is few blocks away and it delivers to any area near this Sushi Tatsu.Stay away!.I have ordered from them more than 10 times in the past 4 months, pick up, delivery any ways, I ate it often with my family so each order total between 40-55 dollars. However the recent order disappointed me the most. I made the order through their website which is shown on google under their business name, and same as always ordered at least 30 dollars in order to get the free Japanese soda, says on the picture too, I left a note along with the order. After I got the delivery, an Chinese accent woman Said that they promotion doesn't apply to online orders, and tried to push it back to me badly. However they don't state it on the own menu, neither their website! (Pictures showed below). It's just a soda, her attitude was like whether you order in the future or not, she just don't give a fuck.thats how they deal with customers, I won't order anymore from them, this type of business won't last long if they keep this attitude. Rude and arrogant. I remember her with old Chinese accent. Whatever she did there, she will need to payback in the future..There isnt consistency with quality and portion...sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's awful (now) ...sometimes I get 8 pieces of takoyaki, sometimes I get 4, sometimes I get six. Sometimes the tofu is cooked, sometimes it's not...etc. I dunno what's up with this spot."
"Meze has been amazingly consistent and consistently busy all through COVID. They cover the Greek classics well, with an emphasis on seafood. No matter which delivery service we use, the experience is good. Their salad is fresh, green, and not overly-vinagretted. which wilts the salad and makes it too tart. Theirs stays crisp and refreshing, a great base for their broiled protein mains. The fries have that mystical quality of somehow still being delicious after hitting room temperature. I don't understand, but I'm not complaining. The proteins are delicious as expected, but the real crown jewel is that tzaziki. Turkish places have a white sauce with a yogurt base, but the flavor doesn't come close. The dill and cucumber taste in a true tzaziki is long gone, but the garlic remains for a long time.  As a huge garlic fan, I both love the taste and the health effects. It is one of the few things I eat that leave my mouth, throat, and esophagus into my tum humming with that garlic zing..This is perhaps the only Greek restaurant in Bensonhurst.  We ordered delivery.  The Gyro was very good, the Spanakopita was among the best ever, and the tzaziki was very flavorful.  The hamburger without bun was just a hamburger patty with two pickle spears, nothing else - some sauce or cheese could have helped.  I'm not sure if I was supposed to find a way to add these to the order online.  The Greek fries were pretty good as they have excellent feta, but could have used more seasoning, salt, and an extra crisp as they were soggy by arrival.  The chicken souvlaki was bland and dry.  Prices are about the same as the other Greek places in nearby neighborhoods. If dining in, the ambiance is great for dinner..A nice cozy neighborhood restaurant.I have been there a couple of times and every time I go, they don't disappoint me.We were starving after a yoga class near by.The foods were served promptly and perfectly cooked.Steak were nicely done. Only thing was Mediterranean style branzino fish was a little bland. Other than that, worth to check out this hidden gem..Great Mediterranean spot in Brooklyn. I loved the chicken platter. The portion size is amazing and definitely worth it. It's a great spot to come after work and have a relaxing meal..Unassuming looking café. Casual atmosphere. Small seating space inside, so not for parties larger than 8. For such large parties, you definitely need in-advance reservations. Recommend reservations even for small parties, because on a Tuesday night, this place PACKS up. We had a reservation. By 7pm, not a single table was available.Staff are friendly and accommodating. Quick service.The portions are massive for a reasonable price. Everyone takes home leftover bags. Great for sharing. Or for ensuring you have leftover lunch the next day.$13 halloumi appetizer was meh. Good portion, but it was barely warm, even after we asked it to be reheated in the oven again. Halloumi is best served pipping hot, which this dish was not.$17 moussaka was underwhelming. A huge slice, served with some tossed salad. Moussaka was dry and bland. Requires a looooot of seasoning. Skip.$17 gyro plate was ginormous. Enough to burst your stomach. Everything was delicious, so I'd get this again. The gyro was on the saltier side, so I drank a gallon of water and was dehydrated for the whole night after dinner..Cozy, friendly atmosphere and staff, our waitress Pale was awesome. Food on point, large portions, priced well. We'll gladly come back to try more dishes. Good for a family outing, date night or with a small group of friends..A wonderful Greek restaurant located right here in a Brooklyn, New York! Very cozy and romantic little spot that serves so many yummy authentic Greek meals. We had the the Zucchini Chips, Lamb Gyro Platter, Grilled Octopus, New Zealand Baby Lamb Chips, Horiatiki Salad, and the Baklava Cheesecake, paired with their White House Wine (totally recommend!).All of the dishes were fresh and exquisite! The grilled octopus is literally perfect and the baklava cheesecake made our Valentine's Day Dinner just wonderful. Do yourself a favor and enjoy an amazing meal at Meze!.Meze sits on an unassuming street corner on an avenue that sporadically has restaurants. There is outdoor dining available, though the tables are not spaced 6 feet apart. At least they have sanitizer inside the entrance.I've always got to get my Greek food fix, so that's why I've been going to Meze. Another reason is really the speed of food preparation. A different Greek restaurant I called said it would take 45-50 minutes to be ready. Meze, however, has been usually 20-25 minutes.What has been ordered thus far:- Lamb Gyro Platter- Pork Souvlaki Platter- Chicken Souvlaki Platter- Fried CalamariThe Greek fries that come with a platter--unless you ask for double salad instead--I actually really enjoy. They taste great with feta! You have to try to eat them as soon as you get the meal or else it'll succumb to the liquids seeping from the salad. I'm not a huge fan of the chicken souvlaki; it tastes quite dry. The pork, on the other hand, is SUPER juicy. I would rate it 10/10 except that both souvlaki orders arrive kind of burnt. Also, for some reason, the chicken souvlaki platter comes with 4 skewers, but the pork only 2 (see photo). The lamb gyro platter is a solid choice. Lots of spices and flavor.Now the fried calamari is outrageously $16.95!! More expensive than the souvlaki platters, which are $15.95. The gyro is $9.95. I thought for such a high price, there would be a ton of calamari, but not at all (see photo)..This place is decent and the location is really awesome and actually very cute and it's great that they have been there so long and survived but please beware of ordering the octopus appetiser.It is not listed on the menu and there is no price listed or at least I can tell you that there is no price listed where they pull the old "" market price"" trick. When I got the bill it was total sticker shock costing nearly $30 for the appetiser which I can assure you was only two legs which is again totally unacceptable.I was a manager of a Greek restaurant and we served an actual octopus appetiser for $18 which had more portion than this and also the octopus dinner on tray which was four legs with soup or salad and a side dish for 27$ Please be very careful and do not be ashamed to ask the price before you order.I give the place three stars to be fair.The food is excellent and the presentation is very good as well, as well as this being the nice little Greek restaurant which is a hidden gem literally almost hitting in a very unusual spy on 13th Avenue in DYKER house for a restaurant.I have to say just beware of the prices, this places and reasonably super expensive.I was a manager of two Greek restaurant for many years before working for the city and I can tell you I was super excited to finally try this place and having even been offered a job to work here in the past I was excited to come in.This is not Midtown Manhattan or the upper east side yet they are charging $7 for a bottle of beer.I don't care that it's the imported Greek beer and all that et cetera, there is absolutely nothing on earth that warrants a pricetag of $7 for a 12 ounce bottle of beer.The next issue is the octopus appetiser which while it was excellent, it was the same exact portion of two legs and the same type of Spanish or Portuguese octopus that I have served in my own restaurants charging at one restaurant $17.95 and at the other location in Queens about $19There is no prices put on the menu for appetisers and I was hit with total sticker shock when I got the bill.I sat down by myself really quick to finally try the place and had to appetisers and two bottles of beer and my bill was almost $100!This is not fair at all and I was going to call my credit card company but I decided to let the tango but I can do my best by warning people here to avoid this restaurant or at least check to see if they have lunch specials to take advantage of and to be honest I don't know if they are going to survive the closures right now anyway.The chicken skewers and beef skewers were very good! Substantial amount of meat and beautifully charred on a charcoal grill! The zucchini fries and Greek fries were soggy upon arrival of takeout. I wish they used better packaging to preserve the crispness. I ended up putting them in the air fryer to crisp them back up. Their Greek salad is full of feta cheese and really juicy tomatoes. The moussaka was super flavorful! The beef was well seasoned and the cheesy bechamel topping balanced the dish..Meze is a Greek restaurant with an inviting, jovial atmosphere. The decor and layout of the restaurant will make you feel like you're part of a large family dinner. My friends and I entered with high hopes, for some delicious Greek food after a few hours of touring the Christmas lights of Dyker. The restaurant was packed when we got there, and we weren't given an time estimate by the waiter. We probably waited about 30 minutes before we were seated. Then, we waited another 10 minutes for water and to have our orders taken. The highlight of the meal for me was the complimentary pita with olive oil. It was warm and soft, but I cautioned myself to save room for the Moussaka I had ordered. It is described as a Greek Casserole with baked eggplant, ground beef, topped with a cheese béchamel sauce and baked until golden brown. When it arrived, I eagerly cut myself a slice, but was instantly disappointed. It was almost flavorless. I couldn't taste any of the eggplant supposedly nestled in between the layers. The ground beef layer did not deliver the hearty meat juices I expected. I tried to douse it with some black pepper to save it, but eventually settled for eating a few bites with the accompanying Greek salad. My friends and I also shared an order of the Loukoumades, small donut holes filled with Nutella. These tasted ok, but I think they would have been better sprinkled with cinnamon sugar or powdered sugar.It was a busy Saturday night so maybe that's why the dishes fell short. My friends who ordered gyro platters did enjoy their meal so maybe their Moussaka is the only thing that needs work."
"I loved the green tea taro soft serve swirl - SO GOOD! The flower on top just makes the ice cream look so pretty, great presentation! The green tea has a bit of a bitter taste that I love and the taro simply tastes like taro! Definitely would come back again for ice cream..OMG I couldn't find the business to review this.  Didn't realize it was under ""Korean Red Ginseng"".  I really liked this place for their ice-cream/soft serve.  It was a HUGE amount.  But what I really liked was their ginseng latte!  Soft serve (dual flavor):PROS:- great amount, perfect for sharing if you don't have a sweet tooth like me, and definitely a good amount for a dessert lover- very aesthetically pleasing- not overly icy: some soft serve just comes out too grainy and almost crunchy in some spots.CONS:- none other than an orchid had to lose its flower :( Ginseng Latte:PROS:- healthy! But you need to like ginseng flavor like I do.- good amount for the price, ginseng is expensive!- not overly bitter which ginseng can be, nice balance with the milk and sweetener.CONS:-none!I'd totally come back for the ginseng latte.  Red ginseng though is different than white ginseng.  So it may or may not agree with your body.  The flavor is great though and a once-in-awhile treat for me!.This is not a cafe anymore. They only sell ginseng now. No more coffee, soft serve, and desserts! It is unfortunate as I really liked their soft serve. They used to have taro and matcha flavour! It was great for little treat and hopefully it will come back someday....Copying my review from Besfren (yelp.com/biz/besfren-new…) as a large majority of the reviews for here are from there also as these places occupy the same storefront.As this is the ginseng side: My preference is the ginseng latte as it's more pure. In terms of otherwise, the maple ginseng cappuccino is an interesting mix of sweet and bitter and it makes some great wake-up energy in the morning. The ginseng coconut drink is also excellent, super refreshing.Review for the other place edited for more recent thoughts:Note: If you like the drinks here (which I recommend over the sweets,) you can ask for as card, 10 drinks and you get a free one.They added a Teapuccino menu, which is 4.50 (well 4.90 with tax) for a small (only small, I think 12 oz.) In short a teapuccino is basically a tea latter but with well Cappuccino style milk. Flavors include earl grey, matcha, and surprisingly taro.While I have had better Matcha in the area (for the price I'd easily go to Ippodo or Blank Slate Tea,) the Taro is unique and delicious. I'd recommend it..big fan of the walnut/whole grain teamy biggest issue are the prices and that is the sole reason why they aren't getting a 5nice people here.They have absolutely amazing ice cream! We also got the bunny tails(?) which are like cream puffs but with ice cream inside! These are also sooooo good! The price is reasonable and the portions are big!The seating is a little tight as it is combined with a ginseng store but overall great place for softserved matcha/taro ice cream!.So I got off the Manhattan shuttle bus from King Spa and stumbled on this Korean cafe. They had the cutest, but pricey!, looking pastries, which were labeled as Besfren pastries. Roll cakes seemed pretty popular, as well as the French items. Cookies and chaps (chapsal dduk - korean rice cake) pies didn't look appealing. They also have a Matcha & Taro swirl that I would have tried, were the weather 40F degrees warmer. I get that this is a ginseng themed cafe, but I'd much rather buy the real deal & boil it up myself, and control the sugar additive. So no, didn't try their signature drinks.Ordered the red ginseng roll cake, and 2 mini cakes - the Beauty & the Beast. Trust me, it was not intentional. The Beauty is berry based and the Beast is a tiramisu. I got home and was so disappointed that the roll cake I ordered wasn't the Red Ginseng!! It was the Milk. The roll was good, but I wanted to try the ginseng!! They wet the bready part of the roll with a sugar syrup that wasn't to my liking. But the cream was ok. I think I was all sugared out after trying the cream puff from B&S. Or the puff was so impressive, these pastries were slightly underwhelming. I would buy the Red Ginseng roll cake as a gift to friends, but I don't believe the mini desserts are worth it. I would come back again to soak in the atmosphere..Ginseng latte? Right, I had the same thought. It's a cute little café attached to a ginseng shop. I came in super early waiting for the Empire State building to open so I can skip all the line. I ordered the ginseng ginger latte and a doolly mini chiffon cake. The ginseng latter was a meh but the mini chiffon cake was like crack. It was so good that I want to order a box of them. I would have licked everything but  I was sitting next to a window and there were a lot of people walking by looking at me looking at them.Come in and try their cakes!.The cafe was clean and cute but it is on the pricier side. Got the rose lemonade drink and it was definitely lemony and refreshing. My boyfriend got the taro and matcha ice cream which is very aesthetically pleasing. It tasted wonderful as well however we realized that it's hollow in the inside so you're paying a lot for the aesthetic value. The cafe is small and there's a few tables but it was all filled up when I was there. Probably sits about 20 people at most. Overall it's an okay place but not recommended if you're not into the price..I love the taro and green tea ice cream. It was about $6. I also occasionally buy the Korean ginseng packets from them. They have Korean ginseng on sale during Lunar New Year and Mother's Day..I'm one of those ""I have two types of coffee drinks I always get"" and I never really try anything else. But I'm incredibly glad we stopped here for some caffeine because the iced ginseng ginger latte is amazing. You can't beat fresh ginger chunks! Try it with soy or almond milk - it's not overly sweet and the ginger flavor comes through really well."
"Good basic breakfast, friendly staff, and damned cheap for NYC. I hung out here while waiting for Lisa C. and the Houston Chorale to take the stage at Carnegie Hall.  This place is right outside the stage door, so it was a perfect hang out.The food is unusually good for a cafe of this type..We have to keep the deli's in this area in perspective. It is going to be expensive. No doubt. The quality is what must be determined, and I must say, I thoroughly enjoy Teleon Cafe. Go there all the time now.The salads are great with lots of options and I like the portions they offer -- it is just enough. (This is especially good if you're on a diet -- the sizing is very good). Soups are always changing and I've tried about 4 different types. Very tasty, especially their chix noodle soup. The sandwiches are all around $6.95, but they are nice. I especially like the Apple Smoked Turkey with Brie. Just damned good. AND they make a good rice pudding, something that is really hard to find. The staff is quick and gets you in and out in no time. Sure you could eat cheaper, but then we'd be talking fast food. This deli is great. 1/2 my office eats from this place of their own free will and love it..Teleon is like if Pax decided it's prices were too high (which they are) and thought that Teleon would be a better name than Pax.Nestled off of 7th on 56th, it's a clean, long, and spacious enough cafe/sandwich/breakfast menu/create-your-own-salad kind of place, with the usual fruit cups, parfaits, salads, exotic juices to go. And some cookies.The good thing is they are slightly cheaper than Pax or Europa. The problem is their portions are smaller (or rather, Pax is oversized on their salads) and they don't offer the variety that Europa does. And their salads, while ok, just don't seem to have as fresh a vibe as Pax. It's a good grab in the morning to get a ridiculously small omelet, but I'd rather go to the deli down on 55th for a larger omelet, better home fries, and same price. They have a friendly staff, and as stated earlier, the place is clean enough to warrant eating inside. It's just not that spectacular besides the cheaper salad price..The awesome customer service of the gals at the dessert counter/register make for a full 3-star rating.  This is just another deli type of spot in midtown. The food isn't extraordinary.  The menu isn't vast and all-encompassing.  They make the food to order, which is nice, but takes more time out of your lunch break.  But the smiles and courtesy you receive when you check out really make it a slight notch above their area competitors..Heck yeah, Teleon, you are all right!  Found this place using my Yelp app (wanted to skip the Starbucks during a recent business trip to the city) and was very pleased with their offerings, prices, and service.They were giving away free small coffees the day I visited; score!  Despite the massive line, I grabbed an amazing nonfat yogurt parfait, a muffin, a banana, and coffee, and was in and out in just a few minutes.  I'm sure there would've been a longer wait if I'd ordered a freshly made breakfast, but that line appeared to be moving quickly and efficiently as well.The lady at checkout was really nice, too; I mean, especially pleasant and cheery, which was such a treat when, for the last few days, folks had been speaking to me as if I am a complete and utter moron just because I don't know how everything works in New York.  I mean, she didn't even give me a hard time when I asked for six Splendas for my coffee!  And everything was packaged up really well---coffee in the bag and all---and was fresh and dry when I got back to my hotel, four or so blocks away.  Bonus!In sum, I had a very pleasant experience at Teleon, and I would definitely go back..OK, at best.However, ""Lunch Special"" is BS.... Soup + 1/2 sandwich is somewhat of a false advertisement or the dudes behind the counter don't know about it.To explain, my coworker asked for 1/2 sandwich, was given two halves, (confirmed that this was the lunch special) went to counter was told it was NOT. Unnecessary confusion. I asked for the small lobster bisque, at register was charged an extra $ for ""seafood""...wonder where that small print was?Others got the meat + 2 sides dish, however, conclusion was reached that the corn was most likely overcooked and old! Meat was decent.Also, stomach feeling a little weird right now....It's right in front of the Kaplan Center and right behind Carnegie Hall. I find that it's a nice break from the monotonous coffee of endless Starbucks (three within a block radius of this place!). The food is decent - I've had their sandwiches, and I've had better for a lot lower price. However, it did hit the spot and I wasn't disappointed at having bought it. I would say if you're in the area and need a quick sandwich or a cup of coffee: Definitely. If you're looking for something more substantial, you have the rest of New York from which to choose. I do have to say: on Tuesdays, the woman at the cashier is super nice. Maybe it's because I'm a regular and she knows what I'm going to order, but she is definitely super friendly - enough to brighten your day. For a while at least..Pretty basic grand-and-go cafe. Got a panini, it was good, but don't expect too much meat. Also got a parfait, boo. The granola just sits on the yogurt, so when I started to eat it, the granola had already gone soggy. People have to learn to adopt the Starbucks model and keep the yogurt and granola separated..Sigh. I have a love/hate relationship with Teleon Cafe. To me, the food is pretty hit and miss. When it's good, it's awesome, but when it's bad, you're left feeling like you just got ripped off because the prices are so high. You do get a discount if you work or study in the area though.One of the highlights is the customizable salad bar. You choose a bowl of greens and you hand it to the person behind the counter. You tell them what you want in it and you can get it chopped. Honestly, I think the salad is a better deal than Chop't down the block..Tried a slice of their Chocolate Mousse Cake. It tasted and smelled funny so I had to return it to the counter girl. Turned out, I was right, the cake was expired. No apologies offered. Went to Duane Read afterwards and bought mouthwash. Affordable= yes. Quality food=I dont think so."
"Subway is pretty generic all the way around, you could give a kindergartner with reading abilities an instruction sheet on how to make a sandwich and the kindergartener would do better than the couple times that I've been here. I travel for business so I will occasionally go to subways in different states being that I know the food and I know its pretty hard to mess up. I guess it's not that hard for these guys to do, I haven't been let down by subway so badly that I'll never go into one again but that statement stands true now.The bun was wrongThe cheese was wrongThey couldn't give me a side of vinegarette that I was even willing to pay for!But how they started my order is the real messed up part, they wouldnt even take my order, skipped right over me to the NEXT TWO CUSTOMERS before actually  talked to me. I was the only girl there out of all guys... they wouldn't acknowledge me until my GUY friend TOLD them to take my order. Then they ever so kindly looked at me as if I just walked in and wasn't passed up by two customers who were male. I will never step foot into a subway again. Very disappointed for a corporate company to have such poor regulations and believe that gender inequality is okay in the workplace..I likely had the same extremely rude older bearded employee as the other reviewer. He has a Desi background and red dye in his beard. This was one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had at a restaurant.I placed a mobile order for a sandwich. I picked it up, brought it back home, and saw there were two mistakes. The sandwich had lettuce on it, which I didn't include in my order. Also, there was no cheddar cheese, as I had ordered.I brought the sandwich back to the Subway, and showed the employee his mistakes. (I took a photo of the sandwich, in case the franchise owner would like to see the mistakes.) The employee had the nerve to point at the receipt and scold me for putting cheddar on my order. I told him that he was giving me attitude and that you shouldn't blame a customer for your mistakes. I explained that this isn't how customer service works in the United States. Apparently he didn't get the memo. The worker remade the sandwich and handed it to me. I pointed out that at no time did he offer an apology. His response was, ""It's OK"" and he waved me off. I told him, ""No, it's not OK.""I would like to hear from this Subway franchise owner. Do you think that obnoxious, substandard service is appropriate for your customers?.Extremely rude older bearded employee who believes he's doing you a favor my making your sandwich. Has a temper tantrum every single time I've been here. At one point I was worried he would throw the sandwich at me. Won't be going back if he's still around."
"By far the best barmen, service and LFC atmosphere in NYC Don't serve food FYI#NYWA.Nice and welcoming pub for an out of town Liverpool fan looking for somewhere to feel at home. Great and attentive bar staff, friendly locals. Spectacularly clean bathroom was a surprise. Nice little patio area out back. Knocked off one star because of the Guinness coming in 16oz glasses, rather than 20oz..Terrible experience. Was advised to sit outside and after we sat and were unattended for some times we were advised the seats are to close to another table and had to leave with no attempt to relocate us. Missed the Liverpool game.A pair of patrons at this bar asked my friends and i, randomly, what we do with our pubes. And when we told him, as four young women, that the question was totally inappropriate, we were told to leave the bar. The man who asked us about our pubes was not asked to leave.The bar tender who told us we needed to leave had a certain look about him. I could tell that he had never satisfied a sexual partner and as a result he was never fully satisfied himself. While i felt sad for him, the fact that be gave preference to an explicit pervert makes me feel nothing for him ultimately. Ill see u in hell yellow beanie..Cool , classic pub with friendly bartenders and Lagos back atmosphere . A couple of vintage video games , pinball and Tabs to watch sports . Very unpretentious, down to earth and strong drinks  - great place for a drink.Generally good vibes at this dive-adjacent bar in South Slope. Get yourself a beer-and-shot special, or throw down some pickle backs before hitting the pinball machines. Low-key, mellow, dimly light..I'm not really a pub person but this place is rad. Authentic Hot Toddys.Incredible new wave playlist. And a masterfully taxidermied squirrel that looks like its fucking a soccer ball.The bartender was super chill and threw out the perfect amount of talkativeness. My friend and I wanted to grab some quick, low-key drinks before a big dinner that evening, but mostly we wanted to get in out of the cold.At the time it was barely 40 degrees out and neither of us were dressed appropriately for the weather so the hot toddy sign on the bar was a welcome surprise. I'm never a whisky person but this hit the spot and I ended up getting two of them plus a bag of shrimp flavored potato chips that didn't taste like shrimp but were pretty good all the same.They seem to play a ton of 'football' on the 'tele' here, the walls are covered with cool band memorabilia, they have a small area out back when its warm, and a small table top game thing if you're into that, as my friend very much was..A buddy was in town recently and wanted to check out the Monro Pub on a Sunday morning to watch a Liverpool match (exhilarating 0-0 finish), as they are the official Liverpool pub in Brooklyn. I know basically nothing about soccer, but do know that I enjoy pubs like this, even at 10 AM while feeling rough after slamming approximately 97 beers the day before. To be honest, I would have thought the pub closed were I simply passing by, but we walked into a beehive of lively activity as people pregamed for the match. Atmosphere was solid, and I enjoyed how being inside the pub felt so independent from the outside world.After downing many Carlsbergs, we decided that our bodies needed some type of additional sustenance and ordered three pies: steak and cheese, chicken and vegetable, and the sausage roll. While they took nearly 45 minutes to be prepared as my friend fretted about how soon his flight was, they came out hot and tasty. We ate them so fast I couldn't decipher which one was my favorite, but I would order any of them again.I would gladly take Monro Pub as the official bar for my sports team. Good food, lots of beverages, great tv setup, and overall fun environment..The best place to watch a big Liverpool match in New York? You better believe it. This place is tiny compared to the 11th street bar let alone Carraghers. But the atmosphere here was amazing and LOUD. As we stumbled out at the end of a great game, throats hoarse from singing, a few well heeled park/south slopers were looking in thinking ""What is this place?"". It is not easy to create a space where that kind of an atmosphere can thrive. But these guys have done it. Of course, my experience is coloured by the fact that I went for a big game in a season where Liverpool are doing well. The beer is good, the banter good natured. A few more seats would have been ace, but where would you put it? I'll be back..Not a big place, but they have booths that can easily fit 4 or maybe even more. They've got a ton of beer options, including cheap buckets of beer. They also have Yahtzee! What else do you need when you have a place to sit, a bucket of beer, and Yahtzee? Nothing. The answer is you do not need anything. If I lived closer, Monro and I would be BFFs."
"Excellent and authentic Peruvian dishes . The fried plantains were not overcooked and perfectly seasonedOrdered the #45 Fish and potatoes . It was perfect and tasty !  Not salty Or overly seasoned The garlic and green sauces are delicious !The food came  out fast and hot and the service was great Clean establishment. Highly recommend this place.Finally a peruvian chicken place that checks all the boxes. it boggles my mind that no one uploaded the menu for this place but I did it for y'all. In any case, this place sells authentic peruvian chicken with a ton of flavor. I went for the lunch special and some extra maduros on the side and it was well worth it. The chicken breast was above average in terms of dryness but the thigh and leg were on point. the maduros portion was also generous and they were fried properly. They also included a chicken soup which amazingly wasn't a throw away. Finally the green sauce was also great; not the best ive ever had but more than good enough and had a nice slow burn spicyness level. The lady at the front kindly took care of me despite the language barrier. All i know is that i'm going to be a regular here..I came here after seeing all the five stars personally from my experience a drink my friend order had tasted like soup as well as the forks having a bit of food or dirtiness from possibly previous foods between the spaces. The food is average. I had ordered the 29 the beef could be improved what I enjoyed mostly was the rice and the sauce..Had to do errands near here. Googled this joint. Street parking was quick. Lunch menu in here is the bomb. Small little joint. Food feels like home cooked. Will come back. Trust!.There's no glamour here, just first-rate chicken with compelling skin and a juicy interior. A $9.50 combo gets you a generous serving of rice and beans that provides a fine home for the zingy green sauce..Experience: I came here on a Friday afternoon with my boyfriend and his family. The fish soup was delicious! The Lunch combo runs from 11am all the way until 8pm. What a great deal! It is only $6.50. Each day of the week, there are different combos you can choose from. Two options per day. For Fridays, we chose from seafood soup or chicken soup. The seafood soup comes with fried fish over rice and beans or a salad. This meal was so over the top for me. I loved the soup. It had generous amounts of squid rings, large chunks of corn and vegetables in it too. Then the rice and beans came with a huge piece of fish over it and a container of green spicy sauce. This meal really hit the spot. I would definitely come again on a Friday. There are a  few tables, the lighting is a bit dim, but service is good and the food is excellent. It gets loud here when the train is coming by overhead and gets a bit chilly when the door is open, but the food is worth the noise and cold. You won't regret it!Recommend it?: Yes! Absolutely!.Very yummy food for very affordable price.  Portion was huge and chicken was so moist.  Green sauce was perfect.  Will be regular at this place!.Honestly the best! I'm a vegetarian and I enjoy this place as much as my family and friends. Their green sauce is so DIE for and their garlic sauce as well. I order a big 8oz container bc it's that good. I love their arroz Chaufa. Their yuca and tostones! My family loves the chicken says it's super juicy and flavorful. Their jalea (seafood) platter is delicious! It's a mom and pop shop and it's the best!.The food is very tasty and considering the other options in the area (and there are several Peruvian spots in and around Richmond Hill/Kew Gardens). The chicken at El Chalaco justifies the spotty service, which has improved since my previous visits. Crispier and juicer, and less salty than the competition..Food is really good, but the service is abysmal. It's fairly difficult to communicate what you want and it can take up to an hour just get a simple order. I'm not a picky eater, but one of things I dislike is dark meat chicken, which is why I specifically emphasize white meat any time I order Peruvian chicken. Unfortunately, this place manages to get it wrong at least half the time so I learned the hard way to check my order before I leave.When they do get orders correctly and in a reasonable time, this is some really good pollo al la brasa, but nothing worth waiting over an hour for.So much potential, but I hesitate to give them anything above two stars for their service..You wont regret visiting this place! When I walked in the place smelled amazing. I saw the restaurant was packed at 2pm on Sunday afternoon. That's always a good sign. The food was delicious too. I'm so glad that the people at Pollo Rico across the street were rude to me otherwise I wouldn't have left them to come here."
"Genuinely this is the biggest joke of a salad I think I've ever had. No dressing on my salad, and the restaurant forgot the chicken that we paid extra for. Will never come back..my salad was pretty bad and i was I treated with disrespect when ordering, and when I came back to complain about the missing ingredients of the salad, I was treated with more attitude and disgust by the same individual who made the salad. Even though someone else ended up adding the ingredients that were missing, the other employee continued to show anger. Because I, the customer, complained there wasn't any avocado or Tortilla chips. I honestly don't think I'll be coming back here. I don't want to pay for my food and be treated with complete anger when I did nothing wrong. And could have had a better lunch..I've tried to get lunch here twice and each meal has left me with a horrible taste in my mouth and an upset stomach. Once I got the crawling bug out of my first salad, the bitterness and dryness was too much to handle. My poke bowl I tried looked like it was made a week ago and the greens tasted like weeds and the meal left me feeling sick. I thought the vegan macaroons would make up for it but those are disappointing and taste like playdough. :(.Paid full price for half a portion of a grain bowl. Ingredients were clearly well past fresh. Service was worst I've seen from chain."
"This is an old school NYC pizzeria that is beloved by locals, yet probably deserves more acclaim.  The sauce has a perfect flavor, with zero flop, and specks of mozzarella thrown on top, right before coming out of the oven.  This is my second favorite slice in Queens, next to Amore Pizza.  Legendary..very serviceable pizzeria. prices are among the best in the neighborhood. the pizza isn't going to blow your mind, but it is delicious. counter people are nice and they get out orders pretty fast in my experience. good, solid place..My favorite pizza spot (locally)! Consistency is king and at Samaria you can consistently guarantee that you are getting a good tasting pizza every-time you order. The calzones are also great tasting! Price: very reasonable - $12 for a small pie (which can easily feed 3 people) and $15 for a large pie! Each topping is an extra dollar. Service: the owners and workers of this pizza shop truly give Astoria a neighborhood feel. They are so kind and so helpful and pleasant! Love coming here for them as well!.Mother & Son run the best pizza joint in Astoria, possibly all of Queens.  Pizza taste and quality has been consistent since day 1 which is next to impossible considering how many pizza makers go through the life of a pizza shop.  The crust, the slightly spicy sauce and the cheese all come together always and deliver with a kick to your mouth....by far one of the best pizza joints in Astoria if not NYC... the sauce in the slices has this slight kick to it which gives the slice it's own signature... if you want authentic NYC... you've come to the right place... enjoy!!!.Old school pizzeria that takes you back. No frills just perfect pizza . Family owned and they put some love in what they do. Go get a slice, no a pie! Thank me later..Still awesome and still around. They dont change nothing here and why? Its a perfect old fashioned NY pizza shop. The kind that made NY famous for pizza..This place is pure old school no frills pizza, its even got an arcade machine here, I think its more a decoration. Anyway there are lot of other places that are more well known in Astoria such as Sacs and Rizzos but this place is the best pizzeria in Astoria easily, its also one of the best in the city hands down.  Even beats the old school Calabros around the corner easily.Some people might think this place is a dive or too simple but places like this one are the reason New York City is famous for pizza. The sauce is quite a thing here, its not real sweet but not too savoury either, very balanced only a few other pizzerias I know of make sauce this way..This place has been around for a long time, its straight out of the 1980s, its also one of few places that makes pizza in the older style. Pizza slices are large and flavorful, the heros are excellent too. I do not live in the area, if I did I would visit more often.The establishment is run by an elderly Greek woman, and she makes an excellent pizza..THE best Pizza I had in Queens Like The staff is super friendly The pizza isn't all greasy and cheesyIt's done well to perfection well nothing is perfect but I do Like Their Pizza.Great old school pizza. Thin slice no flop.  Very reasonable price.  Family owned. Like stepping back into the 70's. Great place for a quick slice or pie! 4 Star!.One of the best pizza spots in Astoria.  There's a lot of very good places in astoria but Samaria is very very good. The pizza is on the Crisp side , not too thick  but not thin crust either.  It's just right . The pizza sauce is a subtle, savory flavorful sauce. The cheese is a high- quality mozzarella.   Usually tied for first choice along with Sacs which has relocated in the last year..One of the best pizza spots in Astoria.  THere are the good spots of coarse but this place is very very good.its been a while since ive been here  most of the time it was good I have not eaten out much during the pandemic i used to get pizza with topings and eggplant or chicken sandwhich here often  . usually the sandwhicjhes were good but a few times my order was screwed up (twice)  usually they are generous  but once i ordered extra sauce and i only got lots of sauce and less eggplant.  I can try it again and let you know guys..I dont need to be lectured on how im not your friend . I havent done anything to you guys.You need to teach your workers manners. Also i dont like being told I have to wait outside the store whilst  others are not being told this . I also dont like waiting on line  wen you take the person behind me on line then wats the point of having a line? Also wen i come to you guys im used to getting a good sized sandwich not the tomato sauce crappy sandwich eggplant one you handed me last time for $7 or my hard earned money. i never ordered a tomato sauce sandwich i ordered an eggplant sandwich. If your think your can play around with my head cuz you think im feeling guilty im not. Why would i feel guilty after having to endure your workers constantly yelling at me. (sayin gcmon cmon hurry up cmon)The only reason i ordered a small pie last time is cuz you let the guy behind me cut in front of me and then you ran out of pizza and out of the store wen he yelled at me again after you left. so i was being  quite nicely  as usual and i got yelled at by you know who fpr putting spices on my pie .apparently added spices to my pizza triggers civid 19?   last time last year i waited down stairs over an hour and wen you know who got there  he acted like he was in a big hurry n started yelling at me. Instead of telling me constantly that im not your friend after i keep giving you free stuff  why dont you tell your staff to stop yelling at people? and if their not yelling their making me a tiny sandwhich WTF? stop the hate. Its more important to me not to be abused than to order a slice of pizza..Not sure what going on there  food is good but the  prices are going up I said ok fine got the chicken sandwhich for and extar #1 was a good sized sandwhich. A couple days after i ordered an egplant sandwich asked for extra sause but got a suace sandwhich with half the amount of eggplant on it ,I felt robbed.  i asked for extra sauce cause im on a diet n no cheese the sandwhich  had not much eggplant on it  it was sort of like a tomatoe sandwhich with a less amount of eggplant . the chicken sandwhich in which the price went up was good. i was disappointing cuz i knew when i got the bad it was too light and when i got home it was not big enough. Im on a diet n i can only order one item per day . taking this into condition all I got from supermarket was cocnut water  n this sandwhich. Im just wondering if they are upset. I didnt think asking for extra sauce was a big deal. I said hi to the lady she didnt say hi back. On the phone it was hard for her to understand my order.  Im used to them making me a nice sized eggplant sandwhich. (iuts sipposed to be my favorite spot who made me this sandwhich?) Was severly disappointing. It had no weight to the bag wen they handed it to me i should have known .I paid them the $7 for the sandwhich but he was asking for $8 saying it was a chicken sandwhich wen its not.  I m just disturbed why he is askign and extar dollar for it he should have said to some one who made it thats it doesnt have enough eggplant on it . Eggplant isnt expensive to buy and I dont feel like i deserved to be treated that way . I try to get along with everyone and hold my tongue but some times i get pushed too far. two months ago i ordered a pizza from the owner . He left . Ameilo was there not being too friendly to me.  He placed the pizza pie on the counter with the box open so i can sprinkle on garlic and oregano  and some grated cheese. He handed me the cheese I said thank you he grunted at me! then wen i started to sprinle  the cheese on he started wit hthat cmon cmon cmon nonsese saying im getting covid 19 all over the place cuz i am not allow to sprinkle on the cheese and oregono at the counter the only problem wit hthis remark is he is the one who put the box there open. if he had handed me a closed box i would maybe had put it elsewhere but since you have no tables where ? he told me to put it down   at the tables that you were using as a barrier and i think thats crude. si i tried to call and tell you this for the last 2 months but no one ever answers the phone .And its always the worst thing for me if  someone  makes me a tiny sandwhich i hate that the most.That why you could not tell if it was chicken or eggplant cuz you served  me a  tomato sauce sandwhich  to put me in my place. well i dont need to be put in my place cuz i never did anything wrong to you or agianst you or your establishment ever. it was allio who was getting agrerssive with me and i thought that by me picking up my food that this problem was solved bnow i see that if he makes my food i get slammed onage or who made it?  Wen i walked out of the store and the wind blew it was so light it almost blew out of my hand. in general i am opposed to any sort of abusive behavior . If im going to be trsated this way paying premium prices i can just go anywhere. Just so you know the price is the same in all pizza places. That was not cool serving me a tomatoe sauce sandwhich im the one paying $7 for it .  I got tired of not saying anything cuz now your  going too far..I love their taco meat or vegetarian pizza 2 slices  with jalapenos comes with free  can of coke cola for $7..your deliver guy who now makes pizza is harassing me by calling me at midnight looking for a fight !  he seems angry cus i sent him a lady gaga parody  video of a jalapeno. The last time he  came to deliver he came at me wen i was working on my car its a joke to me. he has a really nasty way to answer the phone too. The way he says SAMARIA in an angry tone makes me feel like im calling a haunted graveyard. last tiem i asked for extra sauce on my chicken sandwhich and he told me ""less sauce?' hes a real wiseass . he also tells me hes not the other delivery guy wen he calls i gave the other delivery guy a set of pillars worth $100 i dont need this negativity. Emilio talks bad about everyone all the time even about you guys. That his way of being tuff its just sad. last tiem i ordered two slices with three toppings on each and a soda and he told me $12 minimum refused to deliver it. a few time i called in an order and was already downstairs wen i called and  i saw him show up and hide on the corner to call me wen i was there the whole time and i get his angry phone call  yelling at me to  hurry up and come down COME DOWN .  wen im already standing right there for the past hour!!! This isnt about your food its about his anger..the reason why I go hear is because i like the fact that they use the same recipe like from the 1970s and thats cool i like that  a good vibe memories and  hard to find I just wish that creeps would stop stealing the delivery guys bicycle cus then he can bring me my pizza !"
"Baaaaabbbbyyyy, DELICIOSO!!!!! Organized check-in and vaccine verification process with tables and staff ready! Quaint ambiance with superbly seasoned, super fresh pasta dishes. From the fresh Burrata and Roasted Fig, Toscana Kale Salad with Roasted Carrots, Gramigna curly pasta with house-made sausage and Broccolini to a light Olive Oil Cake with sauteed apples to end on the right note. Pastas are toothy and sauces are light and savory. You will be in pasta heaven! Plenty of Italian libations to help wash everything down..Great Italian restaurant with fresh pasta and lots of seating! My boyfriends family was in town and they decided 2 days in advanced that they wanted to get lunch on a Saturday. Finding a table for 5 on a Saturday is no easy task but la pecora Bianca is a great option because they have tons of outdoor seating, heated outdoor seating, and indoor seating! The food was overall great and our out of town guest were happy with our choice. The pasta is homemade and you can tell! I really enjoyed my pasta and the addition of fresh burrata was a great touch. Definitely recommend trying this fun spot for brunch or dinner..The Toscana salad with burrata and salmon was a light and crisp dish that was perfect for my long outdoor lunch on a nice March day! My brother wanted pasta and enjoyed the garganelli pasta dish. We loved people watching from the cute bistro tables. Hopefully NY continues to keep the street closed to cars! The downside is that it's expensive, but that's New York/Chelsea, and it was actually more reasonable than other Italian spots in the neighborhood that I looked up. If you want cheaper and less trendy, more authentic Italian food go to Little Italy, which is where I took my other brother a few days later..Flawless, fabulous, fantastic, stomach fluttering, there are not enough positives one can state in one sentence regarding La Pécora Bianca.Prices aside, you pay what they tell you here because the food is excellent and the portions back up the product. The portion size is spot on, for both appetizer and entree. The dessert can go either way, but in terms of what I got, it is perfect.I started with the meatball appetizer, and it is cooked as perfect as one can cook a meatball. It has plenty of both that beef and pork flavor, and is neatly nestled in some beautiful Pomodoro sauce and a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese. It is also served with two pieces of bread to munch on, and take advantage of it, because the bread is perfect as well. I only wish I could have more of it.For my entree, I got the Gramigna, a coily pasta, cooked with pork sausage, broccolini, and chili flakes. The sauce is almost a rendering of the sausage fat and the juice from the broccolini, and it all tastes fantastic. If you do not like your pasta cooked al dente, you may find the experience underwhelming, but coming from someone who has eaten lots of pasta, this is not undercooked pasta. As for the sausage and broccolini, both are perfectly cooked with plenty of flavor, so much so it will make your knees weak. The chili flakes add some heat to the dish, bringing the unique taste of the dish forward.I did not want it to end there. My server saw that and immediately asked if I wanted dessert, and I complied. I did not want a bunch of tiramisu, but she suggested a smaller olive oil cake. She described it almost as a spongy pound cake, served with apple glaze and crème fraîche. A few minutes later, it arrives and looks great. I then took a bite and knew in three seconds that it was the right decision. The cake is moist and flavorful. The apples are firm but fresh, and of course, the crème fraîche adds a whole dimension to the cake that prevents it from just being sliced apples and a piece of sweetened bread.Before I came here, I did my research to get the best possible meal, and I think I did that, save for the burrata cheese, which you can add on any meal for an extra $7. In my opinion, for what I got, it was not necessary. Everything tasted terrific on their own merits without the need of that performance enhancer.For $60, yes it is pricey, but I will gladly pay this again for an amazing food experience. This restaurant defines what a flawless Italian restaurant experience is all about.Flawless indeed..Came here on a Wednesday night for dinner with a friend and boy was it packed for a weekday night. But the Noise level was still okay , we didn't have to scream to hear each other. The service was great and the pasta was delicious. (They make them in house) Rigatoni and the garganelli (wild mushroom and pesto) pastas were both really really good and filling. Their entree size is quiet large so we were pretty full after just that..Love coming here for brunch! There outdoor dining section is really nice. Also it's in a great area near flat iron. Service was good and the food was not bad. Their cocktail and wine menu was great..Great ambiance inside - very bistro vibe with high ceiling.Nice outdoor dining setup as well. One note though: the overhead hitter can get very hot and I felt like I was getting BBQ-ed (or tanned lol)..Came here on a recommendation and we loved it! Its a cute pasta spot. Super affordable and delicious! Not only was the service amazing (never had an empty cup) but the pasta was magnifique! We aren't locals but this pasta reminded me of my time in Italy. Love how fresh it is! We both got the spaghetti and garganelli. Here's my breakdown:Spaghetti - solid pasta. A bit al dente for my taste but you can taste the fresh ingredientsGarganelli - perfect balance of flavors. It had roasted wild mushrooms, arugula pesto, garlic, and pecorino. This one I could see myself getting regularly as every bite was delicious!Would totally come back again.4.5 stars. The atmosphere is great and the servers were really attentive and kind. Apparently they're really known for their burrata so do add it to your dishes. I loved the garganelli and broccolini - so flavorful..Amazing dinner here tonight!! Highly recommend, totally worth it.Restaurant: Gorgeous and loved the aesthetic. Great location right across Bryant Park. We made reservations for a Friday night. It was fairly busy but I saw some people hop in and be able to make a reservation for an hour or two later that evening, so definitely possible. Just go stroll around Bryant Park while you wait!Staff: Great! We loved our server (receipt says Enda M). He was nice and friendly, without being too in your face and interrupting your dinner. The absolute perfect combo, he was great.Food: We had the Garganelli & Rigatoni with Burrata. WOW SOOO GOOD! Absolutely delicious, I want to eat it again tomorrow!10/10 loved this place!"
"Went there yesterday, and got an americano! Tastes amazing, this is exactly how the coffee should taste like! The quality can compete with blue bottle or %arabica. Def recommend! P.s. for those who complain about the price, you pay for quality not for quantity product..My internet was down one day so I stopped in for a hot cup of tea and some work time. The staff was so nice and even though the space was small, it got the job done!.Great space , one of the best coffee had and the staffs are very friendly and quick serivce.Read all the great reviews and decided to try this spot! Really enjoyed the iced oat milk latte. Great smooth espresso. Oat milk available so that is always a plus. Pricey... after adding oat milk (+ 1 dollar) it was $7! So it was a $6 latte. I mean for new york maybe that isn't thaaat shocking but it still hurt a littleNot 5 stars because they still use plastic straws and not eco-friendly cups. Should try and use the compostable cups. COVID-19 updates- there are about 3 outdoor tables. You can't go in the store except to pay with card. Just take out coffee.Overall great coffee if you want some good espresso but be prepared to pay!.Okay, when I originally tried the Mob three years ago I was completely turned off. Usually the first thing I try is the house roast and I was utterly disgusted. I decided to give this place a second chance about a year ago and this time I didn't go for the coffee roast, I went for espresso hoping they wouldn't kill that too. Lo and behold! We have a winner. I had the cortado and it really is one of my favorite drinks here. The aeration is always on point. Also, got chocolate kids, get your hot chocolate here. They put mini marshmallows in it and whatnot. Oh! And tea-- they have both herbal and caffeinated and even though it takes a couple of minutes to steep, those are minutes I'm willing to endure. Seasonally, they have their patented hot Ginger Brew. I have an obsession with al things ginger, but I must warn that this is most certainly not the faint of heart. Food and Service: the pastries are amazing and I'm a major fan of the almond croissant and a tiny French pastry called a cannelle.Samantha is an absolute sweetheart and really puts up with my indecisive mind. In fact, the whole crew makes you feel right at home. Can't wait to try the new seasonal drinks..Nice lil spot to grab coffee and get some work done ... The coffee is actually worth a sip lol... My friend and I grabbed a bag to go... not to mention the branding is pretty slick. No complaints here..A local coffee joint that is responsibly sourced, has a laid back vibe, and is just a great place to meet up with someone. do some work, or just grab a coffee and aSmall snack. Love how convenient it is to get to on my commute to Newkirk Plaza..This place has all types of delicious croissants! Would definitely recommend giving this place a try sometime if you're by Newkirk Ave!.I ordered a small decaf.  I was asked what kind of decaf?  I replied decaf coffee.  The Brewster served my coffee outside and asked for $4.50.   I responded the coffee should be $2.50.  He explained, ""we don't have decaf so I had to make you an Americana, but I will charge $3.75 for a medium"".  I pointed out he did not communicate this to me and did not ask me to change my order and by the way the coffee is in a small sized cup.  ""Well this seemed like the best thing to do, I don't know why you are upset"".  I left, advising him to learn the importance of communicating, esp. with somebody who was once a good customer.    The place is empty used to be busy, wonder why?????.This place is pretty good. I love that they are socially conscious as witnessed by the Black Lives Matter sign posted on the window. I got the hot chocolate. Was very ... chocalaty. Not too much, not too little, just right. Kind of a bummer that you have to wait outside for your order (because of COVID) but I get it. This should correct itself soon (yay, vaccine!). The table and chairs setup outside makes up for the inability to be able to hang out inside. Nice place to people-watch if you have an hour to spare and if the weather's great. Can't wait to try the Jalapeno Lemonade. Sound good in concept. Let's hope it translate well to my taste buds."
"Hidden Gem Alert!Excellent Italian fare at decent price points.Had the Spanish carbonara and wife had baked ziti. Great portions and good flavor..My cousin & I stumbled upon Julie's on door dash. The food listings captured our eyes & we could not resist to order. We ordered the fried ravioli, penne Àlla Vodka, chicken parmigiana, spaghetti carbonara. We were satisfied with how all the food tasted & was able to travel well..Delicious food, all is very savory.. Had a variety of things to pick from n enjoyed every last bit. Highly recommend.A very pleasant surprise.  I was looking for a new local pizza place to try.  I found Julie's on a pizza website for Ridgewood.  I was especially impressed by the fact that their price for a pie was $2 cheaper than pretty much everybody else in the area.  I was willing to give them a try.  I ordered from their website and was given a 60 minute delivery time.I got a phone call from the delivery guy 50 minutes later.  Early delivery is always a good sign.  The pie was still hot and I felt the heat on my hands as I came upstairs.The pizza is very good.  Lots of cheese and sauce, thickness which is very acceptable to me.  Absolutely worth the price and as good, if not better, than the better places in the area.  Julie's has found themselves a new customer..Absolutely ridiculous. The service was a complete joke. The delivery man took over an hour and a half past the delivery time to bring our food. The food was cold and gross by the time we got it. We waited 3 hours for 3 items. They were not busy and the staff was completely rude and didn't care in the slightest. I will never order from them again. Complete garbage in my opinion..I order from this restaurant a few times a month and the pasta is always amazing!Last night was my first time trying the fried raviolis and OMG they were so amazing I had to write this review. Mozzarella sticks who?? I don't know her haha. Please try the fried raviolis. You will NOT be disappointed. Also the pasta with vodka sauce and grilled chicken is my favorite. Thank you for not giving me fat chewy chicken. Seriously, that is a struggle lots of restaurants have but not this one. My food always arrives hot and I like how they wrap the pasta container in a plastic wrap so it's not a mess during delivery.We order from here all the time since it was Martinelo's.  The special Martinelo's pie with the peppers, onions, sausage and pepperoni is what I order when we have guests over and they love it! Food is always good.  Since Julie's arrived the food seems to be the same, same staff and delivery guy that I saw before.  I was in with my kids and for some reason they said they don't carry ice when I asked for a cup of ice.  That's weird if you serve soda? I didn't notice a fountain station but wasn't looking either.  Just weird...overall great local pizzaria, with NYC style crust.  After 5 years of going to this pizzeria I'm saddened by the change of management, and this is about a year after it changed from Martinelo's to Julie's.  I ordered a pickup for a half and half pizza. Cost is $15 for a specialty pizza and $11 for a cheese. Manager (or whoever the leader who made the finance decisions) wanted to charge me $19.  I didn't understand it and he didn't explain it.  When I came in to pick up the pizza the lighting was dark and they changed the layout and it wasn't as inviting as it had been in the past.  I hope as long as you stay on menu you should be getting the same pizza, but I'm saddened that they couldn't do a better job at communicating their why and having some customer service skills..We order from here all the time since it was Martinelo's.  The special Martinelo's pie with the peppers, onions, sausage and pepperoni is what I order when we have guests over and they love it! Food is always good.  Since Julie's arrived the food seems to be the same, same staff and delivery guy that I saw before.  Are in with my kids and for some reason they said they don't carry ice when I asked for a cup of ice.  That's weird if you serve soda? I didn't notice a fountain station but wasn't looking either.  Just weird...overall great local pizzaria, with NYC style crust..I tried the Caprese slice with the balsamic vinegar on the side and omg I love the salad and very excited to try this in a pizza version! I was not disappointed, I loved it! I will definitely be back to check out the other pizza options and the pastas!.I dont know why this place has so many negative reviews. This is my 3rd pr 4th time stopping in for a slice and I havent had a problem. There are a couple of people in here which is cool. I ordered a slice and it was warmed and came out quickly. The workers here are super polite and helpful. The pizza was good... especially for $1.50... what are you expecting with a pizza that cheap??  I also feel like this place did a great job remodeling..This place is great as is the pizza! I always walk the extra blocks to come here! Live in Ridgewood and there is a dearth of good pizza spots, this one does the trick!"
I don't even want to pick a star. This restaurant gave me a rude response when I called because their driver stole my dinner. The man who answered said this happens all the time with them. I guess they like to promote that they steal. The driver turned Off hah phone when I tried to contact him. Horrible horrible services.
"Order from here all the time. Love their quesadillas with extra cheese. Fresh and delicious..I'm giving this place no stars.. my niece went here to have a little dinner with her friends she turning 18.. the waitress was super nasty to them because one her friends found hair in her food the waitress told her that it's her hair it did not come from the staff.. they ask for the manager who was also nonchalant passive aggressive when they brought the situation to his attention I believe they seen a group of black young ladies and made them feel low, no one should feel this way at all.. not to mention they bill was over Price for some damn wings and french fries. If you wanna be disrespected by waitresses and pay for over price food come here to get ripped off fuck this place.the restaurant of el ambiente was bad, they was unprofessional & they was very disrespectful they was telling the security to watch us making sure we wouldn't leave like we was going to run out the place while we was trying to get our money together. one of the ladies was saying they saw us here before when this was our first & last time coming there. the food wasn't all that good, it was hair in the food & everything. when me & our friends asked to split the bill they was saying ""no you can't"" but the table next to us could split the bill that was really unnecessary..The music was great. The DJ was great. The food was great. Why 1. Simple, they over price you on simple items. I spent $400 on vip, yet when I asked for 2 cans of soda, they charged me $12. The abuse is crazy. I dont recommend this place..The presentation is nice but looking nice and tasting good sometimes doesnt correlate. Ordered skirt steak with mash and chicken quesadilla and the taste really wasn't all that, I wished they put grilled chicken instead of shredded and the mashed potatoes were kinda bland. Other than that they're a great place to vibe and have drink the workers there are 5/5 stars.The service is HORRIBLE. The waitress never stops by the tables to make sure they are ok. You can see the patrons looking out for her to flag her down. The ambiance is decent.Let's start with the positive. Waitress amazing. Really friendly. Food=OMG....made a song request two seconds later...bad bunny was playing. . Management on the other hand was horrible. This lady informed us that we had 2.5 hours for dinning. Which was fine. About 1 hour 45mins they alrdy started giving us a 10 minute warning...despite the table behind us was there for quite some time before us. This was brought to their attention and they stated that they had a big party coming in although all the tables behind us were completely empty. Unacceptable. We ended up leaving before the 2.5 hours either way, but being rushed wit our meals/drinks was completely unprofessional..Honestly, I'm not sure why this spot has such low reviews. I don't know what the ambiance was like prior to COVID but I must say that I was thoroughly impressed with everything about my experience here. First off, it's a little gem in the middle of the block. I went on a Wednesday afternoon and the place was mostly empty. They have a cute little Patio area so you're not dining in the street like at some of these other restaurants during this pandemic. As soon as we were seated a waitress came over and assisted us. We ordered tacos and quesadillas and they were delicious and extremely affordable. The drinks were also strong and delicious. They also have hookah available for $25 which is a huge plus because places are charging $35-$45 for hookah these days (Just make sure you have cash to pay for the hookah and the refills are $15). After a while it started raining and what seemed like the manager and some other guys put these huge lit tents over everyone and we were safe and sound enjoying the evening despite the rain. All in all, I'll give this place a 10 out of 10. The staff was extremely sweet and prompt! This is definitely my new go to for the summer ! Disclaimer: I am EXTREMELY picky when it comes to customer service and my experiences at places so definitely take heed to my review :).Decided to go to the lounge or club on second floor and the place looks good. The music is very loud for a small place, its makes your ears hurt. They constantly have ac on which could be a good or bad thing. Bottle girl weren't that friendly but did the job. But we did bottle service and they poured our drinks for us. It wasn't as packed but definitely had a good time. The music was good and the prices for bottles is decent. Small place but lots of table and booths. deff. a vibe if you go with good friends..Every time I go in here is usually empty. Food never fails is delicious. Great music can't forget that. Great strong drinks. I enjoy it and come here whenever I can. Good atmosphere the staff is super friendly. The empanadas are beyond delicious is a must!"
"1) I have the absolute best time saying the name of this restaurant with a weird inflection. It's just so...silly.2) This is paint-by-numbers Japanese food at affordable neighborhood prices. You're not going to find anything crazier than miso soup here, but sometimes, that's all you want.3) The Caroline maki is a great choice for scallop lovers (8 pieces). The Black Miso Cod isn't bad for the price, and the tempura udon is straight comfort food.4) Their house sake is only $11 for a large bottle. Get it.5) I really didn't think I'd have as good a time here as I did, but our sassy server made dinner uniquely fun. Never would've thought I'd get that kind of humor at a J-spot..Green bell pepper boiled in Udon? That's ridiculous.Beef in sukiyaki is Not chewable. Feels like it's from cows that are one thousand years old and then been cooked for another thousand years. Share the same name with Raku in east village which fouled me. Regret coming here..4.5Decided to stop by before heading to a show at the Beacon, so the location is really great! I made a reservation by calling just to be in the safe side because it was a Friday night. We walked in, asked for our vaccine cards & were seated right away. There was never more than 3-4 groups in the area, albeit it is also a small little restaurant but doesn't feel too claustrophobic or anything at all. I ordered a Caroline roll & a spicy salmon roll - also asked for a sake recommendation which was good! Overall the sushi was great, a very dependable spot for sushi honestly. No complaints; staff was also really nice and had timely service. Definitely recommend this spot!.First time here! Ordered salmon avocado rolls and tuna avocado rolls with brown rice. Perfectly sized, excellent quality, incredibly tasty, and moderately priced to boot. We just moved to the area and this will be the first trip of many..Raku is an absolutely great choice for food should you be 1) pretty hungry, 2) looking for a casual spot, 3) unwilling to spend a fortune. We were surprised by how inexpensive some of the items were, which might be a consequence of being used to being ripped off in this city...The dishes are solid -- Rozena really liked the spicy tuna roll. The bento box is a great choice, as it also comes with ice cream on top of sizeable portions. I thought the Udon was all right, but lacked some spices, and was given Sriracha sauce which improved it all. We were very surprised to note that we were charged for that ($1, but it was surprising, nonetheless), which shouldn't be a thing at all considering it improves a dish rather than complementing it..The portion size here is great for the price. Especially in Manhattan. I think the food was good and would definitely recommend getting multiple dishes, I really liked the jalepeño yellowtail from the sushi appetizers. They have a huge assortment of hot (kitchen) and cold (sushi bar) dishes. Service was really fast too. If you're in UWS near 75th and Central Park swing by!.Ordered delivery. Pro Came very fast. Con Very average based on the items we ordered. Shrimp avocado rollRainbow rollYellowtail scallion rollMackerel fusionIkura fusionSalmon fusionFish quality unremarkable, fusion items bland, sushi rice too much water?Tamago was good texture and sweetness. Normal.Gyoza and beef negimaki were fine. Came with broccoli.Yakitori looked like a thick chicken breast split in half, skewered and deep fried not grilled..Lunch specials are a great way to try new restaurants without spending a fortune. Raku II Japanese restaurant located on West 76th street offers decent sushi at competitive prices. This week I tried :1) 3 Sushi Rolls Combo Lunch Special. I ordered a salmon maki roll, spicy salmon hand roll and spicy scallop maki roll. Mini Maki! The fish was fresh but the maki rolls were half sized. The handroll was pretty standard. 3) Mix Tempura Lunch Special. Delicious and plenty of food. Came with a house green salad & sauce for dipping. Both items were under 14$ and delivery was free & on time. The salmon handroll was my favorite. The mini maki roll size not a fan of..Go-to lunch spot in UWS. Small, intimate setting with the most kind female server. I always forget to ask her name! Inside temp was perfect considering NYC weather has been so whacky recently. I ordered 2 sushi rolls, my friend ordered teriyaki steak. We split the Brussel sprouts and veggie tempura at the start. Brussels were so yummy we dug right in and I forgot to get a pic! The Big Mac roll is huge! I guess it's in the name but I couldn't finish it all. MN roll is a must- I liked it just a bit more than the Big Mac but they were a great combo (pun intended). Leftovers are in my fridge for when I get hungry this afternoon! Lastly, the green tea was great, nice earthy touches..Loved this sushi. We ordered some for takeout. The pick up was easy as it was Christmas Eve and they weren't busy. We enjoyed a Raku Sushi set, an eel maki, and a dragon roll. The flavors were all excellent! We will definitely be dining here again."
"Will always be one of my fav spots. Please don't change a thang!!!        The best drinks. Best music. Best vibe..Excellent cocktail bar! The other reviews are right this place fills fast and the drinks are excellent!  Tried the Leoness (which was my favorite) a lot of flavors, ginger beer, hibiscus, and more side note the garnish is edible!  The illegal was also excellent and a strong guava and smoke flavors mixed.  I saw other reviews about the bartender and frankly he was wonderful & made excellent cocktails; the server was really friendly.  If you are going for excellent cocktails with a friend  this is the place to go, drinks are creative and delicious!!.Cute spot Dark and ominousGood musicIndoor and outdoor seating available Prices are reasonable  No reservations taken and it gets packed quick The food is by far the best, we loved the mac and cheese and the chicken fingers. The truffle fries could've been less fried but had a nice taste The drinks are very good but the bartender comes across as unwelcoming and unapproachable. We were charged incorrectly for a spicy popcorn that I was offered by Yelp for a check in. The server told us that offer was unavailable yet when I see the bill we were charged for something we didn't have. Wack!I also wish the bar area was cleaner We would probably come back for the food and hopefully get better seating than the bar..Still the best.  I walked in with my guy and the owner was there. He was working but totally out it aside to chat.  I really just love their simple Kale Caesar!  It's truly one of the best I've had since it became popular!  Their Brussels are always one thing I order because they are flavored with balsamic and easy to share!  The max n cheese, with or without lobster is another long time favorite!  We are at a bar, so I'm not expecting anything but flavor! And it's delivered!  Depending on your bartender... Stick to basics or go often enough to know who can really throw down!!!  It's been a neighborhood gem forever, but if you live elsewhere or are visting... they have extra Covid tables with the outdoor street seating, bring your people and enjoy!  The service is on point!!!.The best bar uptown! This is how a bar should be!  The drinks and food are too notch!!!  And the atmospheres is a comfort ease for people that appreciate art and night life casually!  Great people, great mixologists and a must to start or end your night!.Super impressive and I can't believe I hadn't written a review for them yet! I love cocktails and mixology so I really appreciate the wide selection of craft cocktails they offer. I've only been twice but I loved every drink. Can't wait to go back!.Great hangout place if you want to relax with couple friends. I can definitely say that I wasn't too much of a fan of the outside patio.Space is small seemed bigger by the pictures shown. The host/waitress was fantastic, welcoming and very comfortable to speak with. I didn't catch her name but on a Wednesday evening she was handling the floor. There is outdoor & indoor seatings, proof of vacation is required for both. I do suggest to take a table indoor, outside seems to be surrounded by street garbage and you will feel uncomfortable with the street rats (family). I personally wanted to try the Santa drink which is served in a head skull mug and what better time then approaching the month of  October! The drink hit, I had two.. drink reminds me of a watered down piña colada due to hints of coconut flavor. Another drink on the table was Honey Deuce which was very refreshing, basically pink lemonade with grey goose. Our table tried the spicy popcorn, Buffalo jerk wings & the lobster Mac & cheese. They are very generous with the lobster in the Mac & cheese, that's rare. The spicy popcorn at the beginning was a little weird, I had other flavors in mind but once you continue to eat it you get use to it. The wings had great flavors the spicy hits you right on your first bite. Overall enjoyed the evening and would consider coming back..This place was truly wonderful. Everything I had was delicious. Lobster Mac was perfect, regular Mac was perfect, I didn't taste the tacos but my sister loved them. My steak was a bit dry on the inside. I asked for medium and I think the chef did medium well. Next time I'll ask for medium rare. Truffle fries were yummy and even had Parmesan sprinkled on top. My drink was my favorite thing. I ordered the pornstar martini! It came with a mini champagne bottle to refill as I drink. It was so tasty, visually pleasing, and really well done.The service was great. My server was kind, respectful, and timely. The menu was online so you just scan the barcode and it pops up. Payment is done right in front of you. These were some modern day touches I thought were interesting. Outdoor seating area has umbrellas covering most of the tables. I went right when it opened at 5 so I had no wait time. I absolutely will be coming back here..I'd give this place ZERO stars if I could! First of all, it's tiny and could use a bit of an update! Secondly, the bartender was not too friendly when I walked in and greeted him. Thirdly, the food was just okay [6/10] + my friend's drink was also just okay. The straw that broke the camels back-- there was a big bug crawling/flying around and when it was brought to the attention of the staff, they were VERY dismissive. Specifically, the bartender and some other chick [ who was not staff but knows the owner] said ""oh well, it's because the door is open"" as if that's a valid explanation for a bug flying near my drinks/over my head!! No one tried to get the bug, move my friend and I to a different table, offer us a replacement drink, offered to take something off the bill, nothing! I asked for the owner/manager's contact info and the response was ""check the website, I'm not giving you the manager/owner's info"" -- I basically had to tell them that they either get ahold of the manager/owner and deduct something off the bill or I was walking tf out. They finally called the owner [probably didn't even call but didn't want us to walk out] and said the best they could do was 50% off. The bartender was rude AF, this random chick who ""works closely with the owner"" was rude AF--literally the only pleasant part of my visit was the waitress, Nae, who was super friendly, attentive and helpful. If it wasn't for Nae, they wouldn't have gotten a PENNY out of me or my friend -- I just didn't wanna completely screw her out of the money/tip because she was great. This place has potential but they need a complete overhaul of their staff, a renovation AND some RAID/EXTERMINATION!!.First time here! Drinks are well crafted. Music is also very lively, a very nice vibe overall. But I'm a stickler for service and though the drinks were great the service was sub par. The attitude from the bartender towards my friend was just absurd. My friend asked for a few drinks and just got treated like he was a disturbance/annoyance to the bartender. Read my prior posts Im not a 'karen' by any means. For reference Leo. (Minus 2 stars)"
"The taro bread is addicting It's so delicious. We managed to eat the entire bread so quickly lol.We visited Red Lotus Bakery & Cafe after seeing its poster of various pastry selections since my husband is a super fan of Hong Kong style bakery. The decor is authentic, clean and narrow-spaced with only 2 indoor dining tables available. We got 2 Pineapple Buns, a Taro Bun and a box of Pork Floss cake with Mayonnaise. The price is overall reasonable with proper portion. The buns were overall delicious and filled with plenty of flavorful fillings. However, the cake wasn't as delicate as what we expected, so we won't recommend it..My visit was a rare but positive instance of a paper coupon bringing me in. Needing to bring a cake to a small get together, the coupon for 10% off a cake really spoke to me. Plus, I remember the days of fluffy fruit cakes at family gatherings, so this type of cake seemed perfect for the hot summer day upon us.There's a case of cakes directly to the right after you enter. Prices are nice and visible.Then you walk through an aisle of other baked goods. I've seen bigger selections, but I was very satisfied with my pork bun and corn dog (seemed more like a hot dog in a baked pastry).The cake really took the cake (ha). The presentation was lovely, and the fluffiness is still being raved about. We got the 8"" strawberry shortcake for $38; RLB also threw in a birthday sign, plastic cake cutter, and two candles. Nice touch!I'd definitely come back here for a cake! They have many other flavors to choose from, too..I needed Chinese Milk Bread and Red Lotus was the closest Chinese bakery by me according to Yelp. They are located on Northern Blvd, a few blocks over from Little Neck Pkwy. It's street parking only, and you will be really lucky if you can find a spot out front, but I usually park at the McDonald's and walk over. Red Lotus is your typical Chinese bakery but their selection is small and buns get sold out early. They also have large cakes and some individual desserts.There were only 2 packs of milk bread left at 2pm, the traditional milk bread felt a bit hard so I had to go with another type of milk bread, I mean I had no choice. I also couldn't pass up a bolo bao and grabbed one of those too. Not sure if it was too hot or if the bolo baos were old but there was no crispy, buttery, and sugary cracked crust on top. The texture was weird and like flaking off and sticking to the wrapper. Prices here are slightly higher than the Chinese bakeries in Flushing and quality is not as good. I would only come here for convenience..They make delicious breads and bread products.  The Asian sweet buns (with coconut, cream....), as well as their savory buns(pork) are excellent. It's soft and tasty.  Fresh, Even over night!  Each item is individually wrapped..Pretty good Asian Bakery right on Northern Blvd. You get a tray and tongs and you grab what you want. Similar to Fay Day if you have ever been there. I usually get the pork filled buns. They have the hot ones as well. There's drinks and other hot stuff behind the counter but I was kind of in a rush so I just wanted something quick to go. A little pricier than normal I thought but that might be because of the location. I'll be back when I'm in the area again..Some of the softest and freshest red bean mochi I've ever had! Delicious spot  @thatfoodood.Great variety of sweet and savory fresh baked goods! Something to satisfy everyone. I wish there were more of these Asian bakeries on Long Island.  There just aren't enough.  Prices are slightly high but this is the price to pay for the convenience of not having to schlep into Queens..First time visit.  Get your own tray and make your selection.  They sell cakes too.  I saw some seasonal items such as tree shaped cookies and a ginger bread house.  They are still selling mooncakes. Pro:  - bakery goods look fresh - add one star for individual sealed bread - friendly service -sandwiches ( $4.50 originally) on sale for 2 for $5 after certain time. ( I went at 5 pm).  We got fish and pork chop sandwich.   They are ok.  Nothing much to say.  - Day old bread sold for 3 for $5 Con:  - pricier than Flushings bakery but again, they have no competition in that area.  $2 egg tart.  $3.50 for bbq pork ( chai Siu bun).  $2.50 for dried shredded pork bun.   $1.75 for pineapple bun. On the other hand, size are overall little bigger than the Flushings ones.  - we reheat them in oven before eating.  Taste was so so.   It wasn't bad but can't compare to those in Chinatown.    Conclusion:  If I really crave for Chinese bakery and I don't want to go to Flushings and Chinatown, I will come here..Cute HAND MADE Moon cakes in a pretty box! Only $32 for the medium size. Worth the quick drive to Little neck on northern blvd & 255st. Authentic and fresh."
"I love empanadas! I have tried Mama's Empanadas before and really liked their corn and wheat ones. I'm not sure whether this place is associated with them, but this empanada spot is good. I was in the area and decided to take a short walk over to order some empanadas. I ordered my empanadas and was told that it would be ready in 8 minutes. 10 minutes later, my empanadas were packed up with some hot sauce and I was on my way back to Bklyn. This review is only based on the empanadas I tried here: chicken corn, beef and potatoes corn and Hawaiian wheat. My favorite was definitely the beef and potatoes corn one. It was hot and crispy with a good proportion of beef to potatoes. I wish we had a place like this closer to home..Cheap empanadas, what more could you ask for? And give me all the green sauceeeee! An order of 4-6 empanadas usually takes about 15minutes +..It is not what It's hyped up to be. I had 3 empanadas, 2 corn, 1 with beef the other with chicken, 1 wheat with beef and all 3 sauces. The empanadas are a reasonable size and stuffed well but the meats could've been seasoned better. They weren't bland but weren't the best. The sauces add a lot more flavor. I suggest to eat the empanadas with the sauces. I enjoyed the chicken empanada and I liked the green and pink sauce. Customer service was meh. The employees seem to have been conversing about some drama and not really concerned about customers. I wouldn't return here as they aren't the ""best"" empanadas I've had. I've had better empanadas from street carts..Nothing better than an empanada after thanksgiving feast!Wify gets her stuff here, and bunch of other indigenous sweets.Like the place for its authenticity and catering to native Latinos.disappointed.empanadas are not consistent.I came excited to try a new empanada restaurant I had not tried before. I am always in search for quality street eats- affordable cuisine that pays tribute to their ingredients without breaking the bank. While my meal did not break the bank, I had a disappointing experience. I ordered to go.The ambiance: The spot is located in the heart of a cultural Hispanic neighborhood! The area is busy and I was really hoping to taste the culture.The restaurant looks ok. The server is friendly. No bathrooms. Parking was easy- street parking available.The food: I ordered this sweet sangria looking drink. Please avoid unless you are in jr high school and really like cool aide mixed with pieces of watermelon and cantaloupe. I did not feel good drinking this at all...The arepas was burnt(see picture). Not edible :(The empanadas: i was hoping for crispy crusts and amazing warm and creamy fillings. Sadly- out of 11 empanadas I got this experience for 3 out of the 11. The Hawaiian, fig caramel and cheese, and guava and cheese were good and was why I give 2 stars- but the others had much left to be desired. I ordered a bunch of beef corn empanadas. They were ok. The Cuban was also ok. I ordered this seafood empanada-shrimp and crab meat. This was not a good experience. The crab meat is imitation crab meat and the shrimp did not taste like shrimp. Sauces: you get a choice of 3 sauces- Tabasco, mayo mixed with ketchup- and a Spivey green sauce.Love it or dump it:Overall- dump it- I will likely not return or recommend this restaurant..Wow these guys have so many empanadas!We went with a couple of the reggae town empanadas and was not disapointed. Very flavorful and the crust was nice and crispy. The green sauce I was a fan of. Super hot though so be warned! Prices are cheap so great for a snack in the afternoon. Also look at the menu on the wall on the right when you walk in. The pics help making your selection better then just the spelled out titles of each empanada on the menu behind the register..The food here is cheap and delicious! I have never entered the place, but frequently order it through UberEats. Love it, but they sold me a spoiled rice and beans empanada today. I took one bite and the smell hits me. THIS IS A HEALTH HAZARD. PLEASE DON'T GIVE OUT OLD BATCHES. I would appreciate a response from the establishment. Thanks..Empanadas are very cheap at this place. They are around $1.25 for beef and chicken. $1.5 for cheese. They taste really good for their cheap prices. Their green sauces are great to go with the empanadas. They only offer one sauce per two empanadas. Also, they are open 24 hours on Saturday and Sundays. Worth coming for this place if your are on budget..I loved it!! Each empanada is $2-3. The regular crust is nice and flaky, the corn crust is crispy on the outside and very hearty. I think 3 would be good for lunch. The owner is also nice and they take card. I will be going back so many more times!! The chicken fajita and the Greek was my fav.I didn't really like their empanadas. Ordered four wheat empanadas. Carne, spinach and cheese, Cuban, and something else I can't remember. I've had a lot of empanadas before and I just wasn't impressed by the dough or the taste. The green sauce is yummy but I was there for the empanadas. The carne was average, the rest has a freezer/refrigerator taste to them which makes me think that the ingredients used aren't great quality. The empanadas that are by the bakery stores in the neighborhood are way better."
"The store location is two blocks away from the intersection of Kissena Blvd and Horace Harding Expressway. So if you are taking the bus it's only a block and a half away North on Kissena Blvd.. Unfortunately it's away from Queens College so you are making an additional detour away from the campus if you are going or coming from school.The storefront is always clean and tidy.There is limited seating of 4-5 tables in the front of the store. Additional seating on the left along the wall as you enter for maybe 3-5 people which is like a counter.You head  straight to the back to get served as the line starts there.Service in this location is usually great. Servers are clean and and well kept. They wear gloves when handling food and usually only handle the register only unless they are switching off stations. They are polite and patient as I've seen some customers who are indecisive and make other wait along time. At those time one of the other servers will step in and handle the next customer.Usually most items are in stock. The only item that is not could be the Spinach. I've experienced that later in the day they may at times run out of Spinach.Their food station is usually clean and well stocked. All items look fresh. Preparation of food is fast and servers ask the basic questions of what you want with your particular sandwich and if you want it toasted and how which for some will be very important. Toasting bread with cheese before the meat in added or after it is added. Then what additional toppings you want and finally if you want a dressing on your sandwich. I would say that you get a good portion of toppings here at this location which will satisfy you and keep you coming again and again.ONE NEGATIVE:Let me preface that this something which has become such a problem for me I have chosen not to patronize their establishment any longer.For me the MySubwayCard has been an integral reason for patronizing Subway. It's a service perk that I've expected as part of their store since I've been going to them. However in hte last two years their redemption card system has been problematic to the point of total utter frustration. Unlike other vendors like Dunkin Donuts, Subway uses a third party company to handle this and their system is ery rigid. If you don't do what they stipulate then you can't recover any points which you have earned. Their process is for you to call them and submit a problem report. I've done that a few times, but let's be honest who has the time to do that? I've lost probably 200 plus points already and I'm sick of the system so I will boycott their establishment till they fix this. I don't expect it to be fixed. Their prices have also skyrocketed in my opinion as it varies from store to store on how high the increases are and which sandwiches are affected.Suffice to say that the Card Issue is sporadic and erratic . I patronize about three steady locations in the past. One by my house, work/campus and another by where I go for visits. No matter what location the issue with the card will pop up and at time will be permanent or resolve itself all of a sudden. I know there are those out there who like subways for the price and the perks of their card.  Take this review with a grain of salt as it has been a waste of time calling them and having to have kept the old receipts to redeem those points....The workers there are nice but they never participate in any on going deals nor do they take coupons that subway texts me. I no longer come here. I go to the one a couple blocks down where the original prices are cheaper and always participate in the deals that are going on.This subway is located on Kissena north of Horace Harding. That's a busy traffic area, i.e., with traffic coming from Downtown Flushing, so that may make it hard to get inside.But inside the restaurant was clean and responsive. The workers were not as reactive as I would have hoped -- I was sent with a list and shredded cheddar cheese was something I had to ask a couple of times about. That said, the meal was made quickly and well. The bread could be a little fresher, but the vegetables looked very fresh.Parking here is difficult. No other way to put it. You may have to circle the block or park in the surrounding neighborhood and walk..This is terrible subway bad service don't let people use coupon get little food for people I will not go again.Absolutely the worst in terms of wait on a busy day during 1/2 o clock. There's always a line of students waiting to order. How is there only 2 people working there? It's so under staffed. Service needs to be quicker & the worse thing is they take their sweet time."
"This place just made one of my favorite meals of 2020. The value at this place is insane, and I feel like their flavors speak to everyone. We got a dragon catch with the dragon Cajun sauce (1.5 lbs of seafood for $25) and chicken and broccoli. The broth is so flavorful and rich, the corn and potato included is delicious too. The chicken and broccoli is also Cajun seasoned, with fluffy yellow rice, all in all an amazing fusion of Chinese and Cajun flavors. They gave us a clam chowder too - my partner said it was some of the best they've had. Not a ton of clam meat but the flavor was bomb and they gave tons of clams in the boil bag so you can't complain. I can't wait to order more from here!After some more reading I'm seeing that this place used to be straight up Chinese takeout - gotta reiterate, give it a try for the seafood boil (and everything else). It's goooooooooood..Solid. Mix of Chinese takeout and Cajun food, kinda like NYC Tex Mex joints that are a fusion of Chinese and Mexican. Except it's Cajun style. Honestly I'd rather just have Chinese but that's just me. This place is still really good. People working there are polite..I have only had the chicken teriyaki here, but I LoVe it! It's so good I have cravings for it. Generous, shareable portions and nice people. When I've gone in and ordered from them, I see them cooking it fresh. I'm hooked!.I was looking forward to getting takeout tonight and decided to try this restaurant because it's closer than the other Chinese place. Boy, was that a mistake! I absolutely love the fried chicken wings from these fast food places but the ones here are disgusting. Sure, they're edible but... this is the first time in my life that I haven't finished all my wings. First. Time. In. My. Life!  They had an uneven coating, so the outside of the wings were bumpy and sort of looked like chipped paint on the walls.The fried rice was lumpy. Good fried rice when each kernel is separate and the consistency slightly chewier than regular rice. There was no flavor and the beef was hard and chewy. Their beef lo mein was ok, but compared to other restaurants, a little sub-par. Once again, the beef was chewy. The noodles don't have enough heat from the wok (google wok hay), so the taste is a little dull.I also had an egg drop wonton soup and it was pretty tasteless. Perhaps they forgot to add the salt? The wontons were comparable to other places.Now, I've explained how all the food is crap, onto the customer service. It's fast food - that's fine, I'm not expecting customer service but I am expecting some plastic utensils. So please don't ask me if I need a fork and a spoon because yes, why else am I ordering take-out? Seriously?Not to mention, later that night my husband found hair in his food. Whoever thought it was a good idea to mention the ""A"" rating fails to realize the grades mean little to nothing other than money into the city's pocket..This review is for the MEXICAN food that is now being offered. I was apprehensive since I saw Chinese food, so I wasn't sure about their Mexican food. Apparently, a Mexican guy has rented a small space inside this place. I got a chicken tamale burrito, with Guamole and Swiss pict sauce, and it was delicious. Only $2.50... Can't beat that. Also got a freshly squeezed pineapple and oj for only $3.50 for a small, which was big in size. I'm very particular w latin food since I'm a Latina, but this guy's food was really good.  Can't comment on Chinese food since I didn't order that, but it did smell good..When they first opened the food was tasty and fresh, now I'm not sure if it's the chef or what the chef has to work with, but the food has become mediocre and you can tell the food is cooked and reheated!  Plus the owner counts every pack of condiment he gives you, Annoying!.Its been here for at least over a year and the food still taste great. The price is just right and cheap. It also seems they overfill my takeout tray. I always purchase the everyday special (chicken teriyaki for $5.50) and on the side I pick up fried shrimp wontons 10 for $4.00 and boneless spare ribs..The only Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood with an ""A"" rating. Very good food here..best chinese takeout spot on the area. food is quick and delish!"
"We had a company organized meal here where they developed a special prix fixe menu for us. We had a table of 11 in the back of the restaurant. The entire restaurant has dimmed lights and almost kind of a lounge cellar vibe. Our room featured its own bar in the front and which has it's own feel different from the rest of the place. It was cozy and modern luxurious without feeling ostentatious.My end of the table actually wound up going to town on the appetizers and the pastas. So much so that we were too full to eat our mains and only got through half of those. This is because they were just so good! The appetizers that stood out where the Fritto Misto (battered and deep fried squid, prawns, and parsnip) and the octopus. The Portuguese octopus was actually the best octopus I've ever had. I'm not surprised since they are a self-described Italian seafood bar and a really good one that that! But really, I've never had such tender and flavorful octopus. There was no chewiness at all. I honestly did not know it could be cooked that well.The course after that was the pasta course. The Anglonotti Cacio E Pepe was a cheese filled ravioli with a light pepper cream sauce. I highly recommend this dish if you're okay with a vegetarian option. The owner actually dropped by during dinner and asked us how it was going. He mentioned that this dish was also one of his favorites.I recommend making a reservation if you can! It's not a big restaurant so I imagine it fills up fast..I recently had dinner at Alice Restaurant and found several of the menu items vaguely familiar.  I later realized that the restaurant was from the same team behind Osteria 57, another Italian seafood spot I had been to recently and both of which offered delicious experiences.What also seemed familiar was the enclosed patio entrance and multi-room dining area.  I realized I had been there previously when it used to be Gradisca.  The space had been revamped from a more generic Italian restaurant to one that had more of a modern, stylish vibe.  Funky lamps, dim lighting, and walls draped with garlands of leaves made for a seductive atmosphere.When it came to the beverages, I started with the Spirit Bird cocktail, which included basil-infused tequila, pineapple puree, lime, agave, and bitters.  While I enjoyed the drink, I think it could have used more of a kick, perhaps adding some chili flakes for spice or using mezcal for smoke; it just needed something more.  On the other hand, a glass of 2018 Vie Di Romans ""Dolee"" Friulano, DOC from Friuli Venezia Giulia was light and refreshing.  For the food, my companion and I shared a bunch of items from across the menu, starting with the Burrata and Octopus appetizers.  The burrata had the perfect hint of salt, a slightly thick rind, and a gooey center.  The melt-in-your-mouth cheese was served with roasted, red bell peppers and Sicilian anchovies for an added pop.  Thin, bland flatbreads were also included to act as vehicles for the cheese, though I preferred to use the soft, fluffy focaccia from the table's bread basket instead.  The lone octopus tentacle had been roasted until tender.  Leeks, radishes, and roasted onions added some zest and acted like a warm salad beneath the octopus.We then proceeded to the pasta section of the menu.  The Linguine came with a white clam sauce made from Manila clams, garlic, and chili pepper.  The handmade potato Gnocchi were tossed with fresh porcini mushrooms and 24 month-aged Parmigiano Reggiano in a creamy fungi broth.  Both noodle dishes were enveloping, homestyle, and really transported us to Italy.  Next came a single entrée - the Halibut, which was exquisite!  The fresh and perfectly cooked filet was served over a salad of celery root, apples, and radicchio.  It might have been considered less ""Italian"", but its light and comforting nature confirmed the dish belonged on the menu of such a cozy restaurant.Lastly, we managed to fit in a bit of dessert and opted for both the Plant-Based Chocolate Mousse and the Tiramisu.  The creamy mousse was served on an almond crust and was topped with a thing layer of raspberry gelee.  The fruit and chocolate combination was great.  The Tiramisu was a bit creamier than I would have liked, but was generally tasty.Throughout the meal, our service was stellar, and the chef even humored us by stopping by our table so that we could sing his praises.  From our gracious hosts to the romantic décor to the handcrafted cuisine, Alice provided an excellent dining adventure..If you're looking for a vibe, Alice is the place to go and I would suggest going in the back versus the front. Definitely more lively, especially better decor as well. It's more of a modern Italian spot, pretty good food, great ambiance, service was great but definitely too pricey for what it's worth. Tiramisu was REALLY good too. What I ordered:- BURRATA: Roasted bell peppers, Sicilian anchovies- TOMINO: Piedmont grilled cheese, roasted mushrooms, beets, fresh herbs- OCTOPUS: Portugese octopus, leeks, radishes, roasted onions- AGNOLOTTI CACIO E PEPE: Handmade ravioli with Grand Cru Pecorino, fresh black pepper (must get!!) - BRUSSELS SPROUTS: spicy honey vinegar dressing- TIRAMISU.Came here because it was recommended to us as a unique and cool dining experience, and it friggin blew my MIND. Probably one of the best meals I've had in my whole life.Although we came  later than our reservation time, they took us in and sat us inside. The vibe is super chill and very speakeasy-like(?) lol.The waiter was super friendly and helpful and went into great detail on the specials and what he would recommend we get.We got a couple drinks, the octopus appetizer, the burrata pasta, the sea bass, and some cake and sorbet for dessert.The octopus was phenomenal. Slightly charred, smoky, tender, nice chew/mouthfeel. It went so well with the sauce, radishes and greens in the dish, adding layers of texture and flavor to the dish. Absolutely delicious--I would have definitely licked the plate clean if no one was watching LMAO.The pasta was also amazing. The acidity of the tomatoes in the sauce complemented the creamy burrata and thick, tender chunks of lobster in the dish. The pasta was nice and thick and cooked perfectly.The sea bass was pretty good too, not the star of the show, but thick and nicely cooked and seasoned. I didn't particularly enjoy the kelp/seaweed that was on the dish though.. a little too bitter of a taste.We got the cake and sorbet combination as suggested by the waiter and it was honestly a great choice-the two complimented each other well. The cake was dense yet light, and the tart jelly blended nicely with the sweet and tangy  lemon sorbet.The drinks were also bomb, personally, my favorite was the viva amor. It tasted so refreshing and every sip came with a whiff of the blossoms. Truly a delight :)I would 1000% come back here..My friends and I came here for my friend's birthday. This place is definitely a gem. It's expensive, so for sure for a nice dinner/special event. The servers were super friendly and prompt. We got a few bottles of wine and champagne for the table, which were great!All the food was plated beautifully and looked very fancy. For my entree, I got the Octopus which had leeks, radishes, and roasted onions. It's a lighter meal, but was so delicious and fresh. The flavors worked so well. Overall, a great experience here :).Went here with my boyfriend for our Restaurant Week/Valentines Day dinner and EVERYTHING WAS SO GOOD. We started with oysters and calamari for appetizers, got the clam linguine vongole and king crab truffle pasta for entrees, and both got a white cake for dessert. Yum yum yum. The service was great, and we absolutely loved the decor. Definitely ask them to sit you in the back - just walking through the restaurant to get there is an experience!.3.5/5 or 6.5/10 scale but rounding up. Cool ambiance, good food, pretty good service, but expensive cost and very small portions. I love a good cocktail bar and I've been hearing about this place a lot for their drinks, ambiance, and food. The drinks were cute and well crafted. The burrata was super creamy but the tiniest sprinkle of green was an improper portion balance to the amount of burrata. Octopus with chickpea was pretty good. Lobster pappardelle dish with truffle sauce was good but the way our server sold us this was so misleading. There were no actual good size chunks of lobster, more like baby crawfish looking sizes and as if it wasn't small as is, it was super scarce in lobster amount in there. Pasta was very small serving size especially for the price In conclusion very pricey with very skimpy portion though food tasted pretty good but not amazing and not worth the visit back..Had a reservation for 7pm on a Friday. Decently busy but not crazy. The ambiance is dark, cool, quirky and comfortable. Drinks were great, menu is smaller but has a lot of interesting options. Service was great, the waiter was very helpful and I'm always impressed when a waiter rattled off a list of specials off the top of their head. Got the eggplant app and it was so yummy, complimentary bread was great, and decided to order a crab truffle pasta special for dinner.. SO good. Would recommend and planning on coming back to try more food!.Hands down the best new addition to Manhattan. The food is outstanding! The decor is so romantic and beautiful. This place will take your breath away. Perfect place to bring a date or anyone you want to impress. The food was so awesome. The burrata was the best I've ever had. And the cacio e pepe pasta was divine. From the beginning of our meal till the end of our meal we could not stop saying how amazing everything was. I can't wait to go back already!.It's way worse than pre-rebranding. I used to LOVE Gradisca. I recommended it to all my friends. However after they reopen (aka Alice), the food quality went straight down. Can you believe one strip of my pasta was not cooked? The salmon skin was burned? The food was so pedestrian. I gave them 3 stars only for the service and the ambiance.I also heard they are associated with Osteria 57? Honestly I am not a fan of that Italian place either."
"I've been here twice. I enjoyed the food the first time better. They seated us in the back corner which is fine but it was right next to the heating unit and it was super hot. I got the mushroom risotto and it was perfect. We were also given marinated olives and bread to start. Second time I went was about 7 months later. I ordered the same mushroom risotto but it was undercooked and runny this time. And we only got bread to start with, no olives. Not sure if that was just a one time thing?I would recommend this place but i was disappointed the risotto wasn't the same..We went to Gradisca when my father came to visit us in the city. The man loves good Italian food and as a member of the senior set, he appreciates a decently lit establishment that isn't too loud (and I appreciate nobody blinding me with their phone's flashlight while I'm looking at a menu). Gradisca was absolutely perfect for a relaxing, comfortable evening. All night long, the service was excellent without being intrusive. Unlike many other restaurants in the area, we never felt rushed or hurried, and we were allowed to linger even after our drinks and desserts had been cleared.The menu seems to change relatively seasonally, so you may find different food on the menu each time you go. We each ordered pasta, and the portions were modest but exquisite in flavor. One of the best parts of the menu was the tiramisu, which was insanely delicious. I'm still dreaming about it and have attempted to create it but to no avail. Thanks for a wonderful dinner, Gradisca!.I usually would never pick an Italian spot for dinner. I like Italian but I've become that snob that only likes Italian food when in Italy....LOL! I hate myself for it...but that's besides the point. I ended up here for a university alumni board dinner for about 15 people. When you walk in, someones nonna is making pasta... that's a lovely sight. It had a cozy feel...very good for a date night.Anywho, our waiter was very accommodating and a little bit of a know it all in the best way possible. He kept our wine and cocktail glasses full! He even picked out my meal... I got the special of the night, the short rib w/ bone marrow and purred parsnips. YUMMMY!!! I believe the rest of the patrons at the table enjoyed their food because there was a hush over the crowd and plates were left empty...so that's a good sign. Soooo maybe, I'll be a non snob every once and awhile and venture here for some Italian food once a quarter. ;-).What a great experience at Gradisca! At the end of the night all 4 of us were talking about how great the food was, service and experience.To start we shared...-Piadina pressed flatbread with mozzarella & prosciutto (4 pieces perfect for sharing)-polenta with beef ragu  I got the spaghetti carbonara which I personally thought was outstanding. My husband got the gnocchi with parmesan fondue sauce and black truffle which was also phenomenal. Food was reasonably priced and the portions were good.Yes, I would go back..First time visiting Gradisca, and we loved every minute of it. Not one bad dish, not one thing we said we wished we hadn't ordered.I was with two other people, and we ordered a bunch of dishes to share, which I really recommend at this place. You want to try all the different flavors. For appetizers, we had the polpette -- three small meatballs, which was perfect for our group. The meatballs were small, but extremely flavorful. Perfect balance of sauce -- again, flavorful, but not drowning in it.We had a polenta that was prepared with bolognese sauce -- light and delicious. Adding to that, we had the ruchetta salad. Wonderful combination, loved the dressing.Main courses: We shared two pastas and a veggie -- the tortellini alla panna was phenomenal. Like the meatballs, the tortellini were very small, but full of flavor. The sauce was decadently creamy, but not overwhelmingly so. We also shared the carbonara, which was probably the best carbonara I've ever had. Guanciale, not bacon. Lovely. Add to that a side of brussels sprouts, and we were satisfied, but not overwhelmed.This gave us room for dessert! There are several desserts to choose from; our server told us that they are known for their tiramisu -- so we shared that, as well as trying a few of the gelati. The tiramisu was the lightest I've ever had -- really enjoyed it. We tried the chocolate, hazelnut and strawberry gelati -- all excellent, especially the strawberry.Above all, we need to give a shout out to Luca, who was the person taking orders and managing the tables.  He was so friendly, charming and accommodating -- and he was that way with every table there. This is a real Italian place -- do not go here if you want to sit for 45 minutes and then head out. We had a three-hour meal, which, like in Italy, allowed us to truly enjoy our meal and our time together. Part of that enjoyment was the timing and attention we got from Luca and all the servers. If you're not sure what to have, ask him -- he knows his stuff.I cannot wait to return. What a find!.We were here for my sister's birthday celebration. none of us liked our main dish, but we did like the seafood appetizer. It had squid, shrimp with lettuce.  For my main dish, I've had lasagna. The pasta itself was made with spinach, so it was green. They didn't use any red or white sauce, but it had a lot of meat. This is definitely not one of your lasagna you would expect. I personally did not like it. My husband got half of tortellini. It was a size for a child, and the pasta was not cooked enough for him. My sister was excited to come here since apparently this is where Sarah Jessica Parker goes. But we were all disappointed with our food..The restaurant was lovely we hear ourselves talk and the food was oh so good!! I had the halibut which I recommend highly!! Every thing we ordered was basically fresh and well made!! It's a small intimate place with good food!! I loved it!.4  1/2 stars but I can't figure out how to do  1/2This was our 2nd choice of restaurants for last night. And I'm going to vent a bit about the first place, so sorry for that and skip right to the next paragraph for my official review of Gradisca. We were supposed to be a party of 4 at a Spanish West Village restaurant. We called in the afternoon to add a fifth person and were told 5 people would classify us as a ""large party"". That meant we would ""have to"" order the chef's tasting menu which is $85-95/head before drinks! WHAT?! We cancelled and went, instead, to...Gradisca. First impression was one of warmth, especially on a rainy chilly evening. They were ready to seat us right away and just past the reception desk was a large wooden table where a nonna was making fresh tortellini. That was a nice touch and her Italian was much better than mine. We were seated in the back room which has a couple of larger, communal tables. We weren't seated at one of those SINCE WE WEREN'T A LARGE PARTY. The music in the back room is a bit louder than in the front but by no means too loud, we were able to easily converse without raising our voices.Service was prompt and friendly. The artichoke appetizer (CARCIOFI FRITTI)was a big hit (prepared, I think, Judea style, if you've ever ordered it in Rome). We also ordered a lovely tho not great Montepulciano which was reasonably priced. My wife had a linguine w/shrimp special which was not only delicious, but smelled great as soon as it was placed in front of her. I had the lasagna. It was a very tasty baked dish, perfectly prepared, but I must say, it was different than the lasagna I've grown up eating in that it wasn't covered in red sauce. I must admit I don't remember what the other 3 people ordered but everyone's food was very good and they were all pasta dishes. We finished up with tiramisu which was delicious. We couldn't have coffee as (I think) their coffee machine was broken but they don't lose a star for that because, well, stuff happensAll in all it was a delightful evening and we will be back..A really lovely spot tucked away in the West Village.Showed up a bit early to a dinner with 2 friends, met one at the bar to pass some time. The bartender was super friendly and was more than helpful in getting scoop on the restaurant's best dishes.  She also made a very decent Manhattan and shared some advice on the local eat/foodie/shameless instagram scene.When our 3rd showed up, we were quickly seated.  Our waiter was very helpful and friendly...and appreciated my feeble attempts at testing my childhood Italian vocab.We started off with the complementary bread, service with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  For apps, we ordered the:Piadina Prosciutto e Mozzarella: piadina atbread, prosciutto di parma, mozzarella - essentially an Italian style quesadilla...so what's not to like?Polenta (special) - crispy, yummy, yay.Catalana di Polpo e Gamberi -  steamed octopus and shrimp, fennel, celery, taggia olives, orange citronette.  This is my choice, and it was a good choice. the best choice. a trump choice. light, delicious, ample fish. A great choice to balance out the carbo-blast to come.Mains:Tortellini Panna, Prosciutto e Piselli - mama caterina's meat-lled tortellini, parmigiano cream sauce, cotto ham, english peas: tiny little homemade tortellini stuff with delicious cream sauce. Not my main, but what I tasted was delicious and hearty.Cavatelli Scarola, Melanzane e Pomodoro - cavatelli, escarole, eggplant, tomato, basil, ricotta salata: tasty, but also somewhat the least adventurous of the mains. A solid safety dish.Pappardelle di Ceci con Ragù di Anatra - chickpea pappardelle, slow cooked duck ragout, candied orange.  This was my main...I was torn between this and the crab/lobster ragu, but the waiter's advice steered me towards the pappardelle. No Regerts (regerts? no milkways at dinner, dessert was still to come).  Great homemade pasta, nice hearty duck ragu...fantastic.Side of broccoli rabe also made it's way to balance the cacophony of starches. Nice amount of garlic...and that's about all I could ask for.And...dessert:Tiramisu - I am by no mean's a tarimusi guy. Never a first choice for me. But, as fellow yelpers have mentioned...Gradisca makes a damn fine one. Very nice balance of light vs. rich. Cannoli alla Nocciola - hazelnut cream filled cannoli.  This was very good, no doubt. Was the tiramisu the clear victor...yes. Did I enjoy this nonetheless? Yes.Gradisca is a friendly place with great food and great service.  Repped..Group of 5 of us went here for dinner on a Saturday night - made reservations earlier in the week.It looked cute when we entered, we were welcomed by our host, there was a lady making fresh pasta :)We got seated and ordered our food.Service was great - food was not.We ordered :artichoke appetizer - okPear salad - not goodthe gnocchi - was the only thing which was really good - thats why the 3 stars.Risotto - vegetarian - okTiramisu - didn't like this at allchocolate dessert - highly not recommended.Well all in all food wasn't great - but we friends were meeting after long so it was a great night - with the drinks :)"
"Walked in and asked for ceviche. Staff was careful to socially distance with mask but what I'm writing about was the food. OMG. Such delicious ceviche, perfect flavor, marinated to perfection ok! I'll be back. The food is FRESH and was ready in MINUTES!.I'd been meaning to try out Don Patron for awhile and finally stopped in when I saw they had a burria tacos special. The only thing I regret about trying them out was not doing it sooner. I've been there a few times since (about once a week) and they've yet to disappoint. If you've been dragging your feet on checking them out like I was, stop it..It's all right super over priced and I've had better Korean fried chicken but it gets the job done,.Ordered dinner delivery from here tonight and it was... not good. The mariscos didn't taste fresh in any way, which is an unsavory trait for seafood. The camarones was similarly unsavory and overcooked into a withered ball. The salsa had an unclean aftertaste, almost like it came from a dirty bowl. The guac was tasty but was essentially the only redeeming quality of our order. Will not be ordering from here again..I wish I could give them 6 stars! Don Patron offers a super authentic, extremely delicious, and totally home-style Mexican menu. In my 6 years in New York, I have always tried to find Mexican food as good as the restaurants in my hometown in San Diego or even Mexico, and I never had success until now! Don Patron is so much better than the rest of the options around the city. Here you will find perfectly balanced flavors and quality ingredients that is key to the traditional Mexican recipes. If you want to have REAL Mexican, go to Don Patron now..Never again. Called for status on a order incorrectly reporting delivered -- they told me its not their problem, call Uber Eat. Asked to speak to a manager -- they refused. Asked how they were going to fix the problem -- they hung up the phone.  Have to fight the charge with Uber directly -- very unhelpful. Avoid..The owners & their service was wonderful . Very cute hidden spot that you'll never forget about once you've found it . Thank you for serving my friends and I . Will be back soon ..This place is just so good. The food is so flavorful and delicious, and obviously made by a real person. Their mole sauce, salsa, pica de Gallo and especially their horchata are to die for. Great service too. Highly highly recommend..They processed my online order on their own website for pickup when the restaurant was closed. When I noticed that my credit card bill was still charged for the order, they refused to help or refund my money..i love this restaurant right around from where i live. Their taco salad its amazing. Everything was cooked right and the peppers were so delicious. Tacos!"
"Never a disappointment Pizza and Pita do a great job at the few things they do.  They have a pretty nice selection of halal stuff.  I ordered a combo over rice and it was good (but nothing compared to the corner carts).  Their pizzas are huge slices and you can basically add anything you want to it.  My favorite things from here though are the calzones and the rolls.  Sausage or chicken rolls are pretty damn good but the cheese calzone is awesome.  Made pretty much on the spot since they don't make those earlier and reheat - it is a molten ton of cheese and ricotta and if you want you can probably have anything else tossed inside it as well.  Also get extra marinara sauce because it's great with the calzone.  And if you only have a buck fifty...2 giant garlic knots with marinara sauce will basically be a meal replacement for a few hours..20 years later And they're still here doing what they do best. Came back for their chicken rolls. I missed this in CA. can't beat nyc pizzerias!!!.Pizza & Pita is a tiny place right near NYU Langone with only a few tables available. I assume that most of the business here is from take-out orders or delivery. I have ordered delivery from here three times, mostly because it's a bit cheaper than the other pizza places in the area. I prefer the pizza at Rocky's and Garlic New York Pizza, but they're also more expensive. Delivery is usually fast and the food is OK given the price. The pizza is edible and I actually liked the chicken roll the one time I had it.However, the last time I ate from here I tried the buffalo chicken roll and I got severe food poisoning a few hours later. I now have to question how clean and sanitary the restaurant and the workers there are. Just a cautionary tale for when you're feeling cheap and don't want to spend a few extra dollars somewhere else..Well after the shutdown everything has been really good. This my staple pizza goto. Plus it seems like they are open all the time. Ah... they close at 4:30amFood is good and management is very responsive..This place is shut down ... obviously unhealthy and unsafe. They have been closed, I am not sure by whom, but someone. This is the worse place in NYC and I am glad the authorities are finally on to them. They have made up various stories, one funny one being a ""gas leak"", but when you are ""closed for renovations"" it means only one thing.Danger.#eat24 has let these morons continue to scam everyone..Major improvements here. All past problems are now dealt with, leaving only mouth watering pizza and more. I order from here at least once a week. When ordering pizza a request ""Almost WELL DONE"" and that gets me just what I like.Eggplant is always perfect too!.There have been some improvements. Sometimes it is 100% and worth five stars and sometimes its worth one start, so that is why I am at three stars.I have just ordered pizza, which is pretty good considering these guys are not Italian. And considering the last delivery from here, the cheese ran and pooled on one side of the pie. And it was cold. But sometimes, it is great pizza. And my middle some will eat three slices no matter what. They still insist on giving BBQ Sauce with the falafel, which is disgusting as far as I am concerned. Good hot sauce would be appreciated as would good white sauce. 50% of the time delivery is very fast - 50% of the time it's very slow..It is NEVER going to improve. This place MUST be under new ownership - it has gone so far downhill. I just got the eggplant dinner ... what a joke ... a few smallish pieces of eggplant and a giant over-sized plate of overcooked spaghetti. I now have to order an actual Italian dinner from real Italians ... not these .... fools. Horrible experience..Zero stars would be too many.Basically my girlfriend likes the salad from here, so to meet the ridiculous minimum or $10.00 I will order something. So tonight I was actually hungry, very hungry, which is clearly a mistake when you are ordering from Pizza & Pita. So since they usually deliver within 20 minutes to us, I was alright, I'll order something. Mistake!Of course it figures when I am starving, it's going to take them 50 minutes to deliver. I was so f%#king hungry, after 30 minutes I broke into a bag a potato chips. Mistake! Pizza & Pita is just barely passable, but getting delivery from here and eating their food, is really not a civilized way to live. I am going to try and change my ways. Don't know how my girlfriend will be able to get her $6.50 salad from here, when it has a $10.00 minimum... but I can not keep sacrificing my digestion..I wish their falafel pita was served in an authentic way, it should have either a Tahiti or white sauce and a hot sauce. Unfortunately these guys are not too connected anymore to the origin of pita. I got delivery from there tonight and there was no white sauce but there was a red sauce, so I dumped the red sauce all over the pita sandwich, bit into it, expecting heat, but no, it wasn't hot sauce, it was yucky BBQ sauce. How disgusting....super sweet. Turned the meal into total garbage. I was so pissed. When I called them, the guy was very nice, and said next time I should write a message if I want it served the traditional way, with hot and white sauce. I made another dinner to try and get the horrible BBQ sauce taste out of my mouth. Didn't work, like garbage in my mouth still.Not sure if I can trust a pita place that automatically serves BBQ sauce instead of white and hot sauce..The food here is generally very good and delivery is good. Tonight delivery did not seem very long, but the food was cold when it got here. Consistency on delivery would get them a 4 or 5 star rating..Everything looks so good on display. I ended up choosing the buffalo chicken slice. It wasn't bad it was off. Like there was a missing ingredient or something..These are the nicest and most hard working guys. They make incredible food. Always fast and fresh. Great job!.These are the nicest and most had working guys. They make incredible italian and halal food. Always fast and fresh delivery. Great job!.Terrible experience, the guy walking was extremely unprofessional and ruin, uses foul language directly towards me when he couldn't understand what I said at first. I have to constantly remind him my order. This happened multiple times. The food is just ok. Never coming here again..Honestly  I don't  really write reviews about places,but these guys need to understand one thing If they want to run a business THE FIRST STEP IS  :  COSTUMER SERVICE .Being rude and disrespectful is not an option,you hate  your job it's  easy quit simple as that.I would really love to pay them a visit to see if the phone guy is as tough  as he speaks since I didn't  had the chance to meet him because  I ordered  my first and  last delivery  from this  place.FYI : Your food honestly sucks..Review: Pizza & Pita Halal Food is a typical tiny shop with big slices for low prices. I like the guys who own this place. 3.2 Stars.Dough: 4 Stars; Toppings: 3 Stars; Freshness: 2 Stars; Uniqueness: 2 Stars; Price: 5 Stars..After a long day at the Governors Ball music festival, we were starving on the walk back to our hotel from the ferry station.  Like an oasis in the desert, Pizza and Pita showed up in the distance.  There are not many things better than a slice of pepperoni pizza after a day full of dancing and jamming to the likes of De La Soul and The Killers.We walked in and the shop was mobbed, but the manager/owner moved things along quickly and efficiently.  Although the pizza is not even close to the best I ever tasted, it was still delicious and hit the spot.Very limited seating and they take credit cards over $5."
"Just rolled in from La Guardia and had time to kill before checking into BnBWe heard this spot was new and decided to check it outThe pizza was aight (Margherita was the best one) However, service was kinda unenthusiastic leaning towards rude and unwelcoming Not a great first impression.I have never had a better dining experience in my mortal life. These people are so extraordinarily amicable, I have never left a pizza shop so happy. Genuinely fucking incredible in every aspect thank you everyone.I've never had better NY pizza than this place to date. Friendly staff, reasonable prices for the slice, good ingredients, perfect crust. Recommend:Tartufo MargheritaFig and hamAverage:The New Yorker.I'industrie Pizzeria is probably one of the most trendy pizzerias I've seen in New York. During peak hours, lines can go out the door and down the block so make sure you arrive early! I got the New Yorker, margherita and the pepperoni. The prices are pretty pricey and the slices are smaller than your average New York pizza, but the ingredients are high quality. I really enjoyed the pepperoni and the bits of burrata on the New Yorker. I also noticed that they sell sandwiches, donuts and soft-serve. Next time I plan on picking up those along with a burrata slice!.L'Industrie is in the conversation for Best Pizza in New York. That's not an exaggeration. Noticeably good ingredients. Every slice gets topped with fresh basil, shaved parmigiano, and a drizzle of olive oil. The staff and music are markedly Brooklyn-cool.Pro tips:Go off peak to avoid the line,It's a few stools inside and a few tables outside& eat it while it's hot.Best pizza I've had! We got the New Yorker and L'Industrie slices.Update 2022:Over the 4 years, their dough never fails. No dry or off days - consistency and quality. Pepperoni and margherita are so good too. Their counter seating indoors is open, as is their covered outdoor with plenty of plants and a TV..Mmm, love their Burrata Pizza!Everything about it is just good. The crust has a nice chew and flavor, the tomato sauce is not too acid or sweet, the burrata is creamy and the olive oil drizzle adds a nice touch. And don't forget to ask for the hot honey! It's a little hard to use because the shape of the container doesn't make it easy to drizzle it, but it's so good!.The best thin crust pizza I had in NYC! If you're a big thin crust person, go here. It's absolutely crunchy and flavorful. The tomato sauce they use is really good and their white slice, the Tartufo blew my mind! Super great flavor and has a great outdoor space to hang out with friends..My boyfriend and I tried 6 slices at l'industrie and loved every bite!! I've ventured to pizza hot spots in NYC: Rubirosa, Joe's, Prince St., Bleecker St., 99 cent, etc, and this is the best pizza I've had in NYC so far. I think the best slices are the fig, burrata and spicy salami. FYI you only need 2 slices per person, but we like to try everything so we over-ordered. I've heard that the pizza is better if you order a whole pie since they make it fresh, but I honestly thought the by the slice was amazing too.I tried the white pizza, the margherita and the New Yorker as well, and I thought the white was just too plain for me. Margherita was solid- zesty sauce on perfect crust. The New Yorker was their version of a meat lovers. It was good, but maybe too heavy on the meat for my personal tastes.Come here when you're in Williamsburg... you won't regret it!.Hoooooooly crap this was prob the best pizza I've had in nyc and will prob be #1 for a while?? I almost skipped dessert and wanted to get a second slice instead. I got the fig and bacon pizza because I was wanting something sweet ($6 - most expensive one I think?). it was an absolute delight and treat. It felt like absolute luxury eating it. The pizza came out piping hot, the ingredients were top tier, the combination and ratio of toppings and sauces were sophisticated and unique, the bread was thin, delicious, and crispy, there was a lot of crust to enjoy, and the pizza looked like a frickin piece of art. It's only been 4 hours since I had a slice and I am dreaming about the next time I'm coming back. I almost don't wanna eat pizza anywhere else haha.Forget pizza tours. come here and try every single slice they've got (they've got a good menu)! That's what im doing next time I go out for pizza!They also offer chili oil to put on top of your pizza if you'd like!"
"First of all, super courteous to first responders!!Very clean and neat inside.Ok, so this is my fave pizza place in the area.  The ingredients are FRESH and it is just absolutely delicious.This slice has artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, mushrooms and olives. Perfect!My partner ordered the French fries with his lunch and shared with me....omg, perfectly sliced, fresh, delicious.Could not be more satisfied!!Thank you!.Nice vibe at the restaurant, the food is pretty good. I have been here at least 7 times in the past month. Their pizzas are mostly consistent, calzones amazing and the appetizer artichoke dish is to die for.Definitely recommend, the staff are also extremely friendly..After several months of Table 87-less life, we decided to order a large Margherita pizza for delivery ($30 + tip) via Seamless. When we ordered in the past, their pizzas have been inconsistent (too doughy, not enough cheese, etc), but this time around we were extremely satisfied! Wee! The gigantic pie came in hot and in less than 45 minutes. Fresh basil and mozzarella with a sweet tomato sauce. Crust was charred nicely with an excellent chew. Stick with the classic Margherita with no toppings and ask for a side of their roasted garlic!.Get their grilled octopus starter. You'll orgasm at least five times.Pizza is legit here. Can't go wrong with any of them. Portions are average sized, despite our server exclaiming, ""We like to do big portions here to satisfy our guests!"". Octopus starter (small), 12"" pizza ($21...too much), and two glasses of wine came out to about $70..Actually going to create an addendum to my reviews with a more recent order. I live in the neighborhood and was surprised at how fast they got my pizza delivered. It was still hot! Super impressive at how efficient they have been with the online orders. Pizza was great as usual, the sauce is so delicious and the ratios are perfect. The crust is thin but able to support the filling. This time we had the burrata margherita with pepperoni and the mushroom truffle pizza. Really enjoyed both, I think Table 87 is my favorite pizza spot in the area lately.I used to see one of my neighbors consistently order pizza from Table 87 so I figured it was worth a shot. With so many different pizza places in the area, I was intrigued by their loyalty. We were walking our dog and passed by, figured it was a great opportunity to try. I like to try a ""simple"" flavor when first trying a place, such as Margherita, so we got a couple of drinks and a 12"" pizza. I was pleasantly surprised by the thin crust! Love a thin crust with balanced amount of filling. The pizza feels light and it's overall very flavorful - would I add a bit more salt? Yes, but I feel that is my personal taste. I loved the sauce. I would definitely come back to try more stuff from their menu - which includes more items other than pizza by the way.Stopped by for a bite - finally trying out this place after seeing so many of their pizzas being delivered to our building. Decided to go with a simple flavor since it was our first time so we chose the burrata margherita. I had a sangria, which was ok - nothing special. They have Mexican soda so that is pretty cool! Pizza looked very nice, you can tell the cheese to crust to sauce ratio is good. Their tomato sauce is very good but could use some salt - however, I do agree that once you have other toppings they add extra salt so it really depends on what you're getting. Anyway, I was really happy with their pizza and so was my husband. Nicely done thin crust pizza if you're in the mood for that! Staff is super nice too and food comes out pretty fast.This place was okay for me. We had the watermelon salad- the watermelon wasn't that fresh or juicy in my opinion. It also wasn't exactly the greatest, most mind blowing dish, as it was literally just watermelon with cheese and balsamic vinegar on top which you can easily make at home. I had the personal Margherita pizza which wasn't bad. The cheese and sauce were tasty but the crust was kind of bland and plain. I only ate the parts with the sauce and cheese and tossed the crust because of this. Not the worst place nor the best. Prices are decent for pizza..Wow. Just wow. My friend bought two margherita pies for us to eat near the playground. I've not had pies from here before and was blown away. The pies were so nice and delicious especially when you add the peppers and garlic condiments on the pizza. The ratio of sauce/cheese/basil was just right. I ate two slices, could have gone for more but didn't want to be the only person who went for three slices... I am not sure how much he paid for them but I will be ordering from here in the future!.What a serious disappointment.Lori, I hope your other Shark Tank investments are making serious money, because this one did not work out for me. As somebody who has tried company products and investments from Shark Tank, I always go into them thinking, boy, if a billionaire is willing to invest a lot of money into them, they must be worthwhile. While that is true for some of them, it does not always hold true to others. Unfortunately, this is one of those clunkers.The coal oven pizza by the slice is a great idea as the pizza cooks faster, therefore, going from oven to box (or table) in a matter of minutes. It might work for a tourist, or the casual pizza eater, but as a New York pizza aficionado, I have higher expectations than that. Table 87 does not meet them.Table 87's pizza comes across as Patsy's meets Di Fara. Incredibly, their price is somewhere in between the two pizzerias as well ($4 a slice, as Patsy's is $2 and Di Fara is $5). Unfortunately for Table 87, both Patsy's and Di Fara slices are comparatively better than Table 87's slice. The crust is too chewy, the sauce is too sweet, and the cheese is highly inconsistent throughout the slice. Sometimes you get a great hit of it, other times, it is nonexistent. The Margherita slice overall tastes like cardboard with sauce and cheese. The sausage slice is not much better, as I barely taste the sausage, along with my other criticisms of the Margherita slice.Lest be forgotten, it is disappointing and unmemorable. They also sell frozen slices, but if the in-house product is not great, what makes me think the frozen pizza is better?Next please, because I am out..This BK based pizzeria is our go-to spot for pandemic driven indulgent eats.  We've enjoyed their signature margheritai pie:  plain; topped with mushrooms; with choice of hot or sweet sopressata; and loaded with their delicious house made sausage.  Some would say that would make us experts on all things pizza.  I did grow up on Long Island, after all.  ...and as an expert on all things good for you (soul, not body folks), Table-87 is the most underrated pizza spot in all of NYC and hands down our favorite place to grab pizza.  There, I said it.  Whew.Perhaps the pizza gods that be frown upon their growing DTC and CPG businesses.  It doesn't change the fact that these guys deliver a damn good slice and aren't dainty around the toppings like some of their competitors.If there is a bit of criticism to be had, it's this:  ask for your crust well-done, as some people find their pizza to be a bit too soggy upon delivery..My girlfriend and I used to be big fans. Today though we went in for pickup and there was barely any sauce on our pizza and it was super dry and burnt in a bunch of spots. It wasn't terrible but it definitely wasn't the pizza we usually get here. You could tell they used the last drops of a can of sauce on us and didn't bother opening a new one. I get it but hey we paid good money for that pie. I'm a bit disappointed. We'll be back but I hope this doesn't happen again..Nobody's talking about the best thing they have. Which is the Large Square Margarita. It's insanely good and nobody orders it because it's not thin crust pizza.  And because it's like over $30.  Worth it though."
"The BEST Omakase I've ever had -- even if it's $185/person (18-course). My boyfriend and I have been here for our birthdays for a couple of years now.. However, they have permanently closed :(Nonetheless, this place deserves 5-stars because it was definitely our favorite Omakase place in NYC..My girlfriend told me she wanted fancy Japanese for her birthday dinner. So I went looking up expensive izakayas in NYC. Wrong... She wanted extremely well done sushi. Thus, we ended up at O Ya and were very very happy.The food is fantastic, I think that goes without saying. If you had an concern, the food is amazing. Done. What I was expecting was the great service. Our server was very friendly, attentive and helpful. She helped me find some sake I'd never had before and was a constant source of information as we had lots of questions about our meal. Also, she was nice enough to put together a little to do for my girlfriend's birthday. Through in a very cool Ambience wiht a fantastic soundtrack and we had the perfect evening. (Seriously, it was one good song after another!) It was absolutely lovely.I don't think I can recommend O Ya enough. The food is great, the service is perfect and the sake selection is amazing. Just go already!.Came here for a birthday omakase dinner and had a fabulous experience. The waiter and waitresses took rotations to help clean up our dishes and replace our dirty utensils once it moved from sushi, to sashimi, to dessert. I loved how each bite sized dish had a enormous amount of various flavor. The staff and chef took their time to serve and make the food so I didn't feel rushed throughout my time there. Def worth the splurge to visit for a special occasion.It was alright. Probably not worth $185 in my opinion. Rice was def too soft and smooshy on the day I went which was a big disappointment. Memorable pieces -Kumamoto oysterFresh Water EelScallopMushroomHokkaido Miyakzaki A5Foie Gras.Located conveniently near Madison Square Park. It is situated next to the ParkSouth hotel (the hotel and restaurant are connected). If you live in NYC and live for omakase, this is definitely a great spot. Though I remove a star for the value. Not sure why NYC omakase charges almost twice of what it would charge in Tokyo and Kyoto or any other city for that matter but that appears to just be the reality of high quality Japanese food in the city. Interior is dimly lit but not to the point you need extra lighting to see the menu, the right amount at that perfect soft lighting. Design is typical modern Japanese minimalist. The ambiance quiet and calm. My friend and I sat at the tables, not watching the chefs (typically we do like observing but that night we decided on table). This is not traditional omakase, there is absolutely a modern spin and influence on each dish. Their presentation clearly reflects the chef's high attention to detail while still maintaining subtlety and simplicity. My friend and I chose the grande tasting ($285/person, ouch). See my photos and video for a few dishes that we were served. You can just tell by the glean on the prawns that they're quite fresh. I had no complaints for any of my dishes which is rare. Portions are basically singular bites for each ""course"" so be aware of that prior to dinner. Don't expect a large meal. I would always recommend not doing pairings as they're typically exorbitantly overpriced and you can find a great wine (or two for that matter with pairing at $185/person) that pairs well throughout the courses. The servers were all quite observant and well versed on the menu and wine. They offered additional background on food or chef's choices as my friend and I are always interested in learning more about our courses..My boyfriend and I decided to celebrate our anniversary at O ya, and we had the 21 grand tasting omakase. The food was exceptionally well done! Every piece was unique and well-presented. Easily one of the top 3 best omakase in NYC. The ambiance and service were also superb. They gave us rosé champagne on the house, knowing it was our anniversary. I highly recommend O ya for special occasions!Tip: Request for a bar seating near the chefs, which will definitely enhance your experience..food: 3/5atmosphere: 3/5service: 4/5price: 1/5 (based on what we were served - read my review)total- 2.75.. but I really can't give this restaurant 3 stars.. feels like 2 is just enough.We had extremely odd experiences from this restaurant.1. They serve sushi in the beginning, sashimi, vegetables,  dessert. We were impressed in the beginning because their sushi was so goood despite of tiny pieces/size (compare to other sushi places in nyc), but we were not happy at the end as they served food totally opposite way. They should serve vegetables (If they really need to serve vegetables in their course -_-), sashimi, sushi and dessert. We asked our waiter what the strategy was to serve in this way and he said it cleans our palates as we move along to the lighter dishes... hmmm. I dont know about that.2. I am not paying $185 to eat vegetables.. They have 3 different veggie courses in their tasting menu - mushroom, cauliflower and sweet potato with toasted bread. Even if they are organic, super fresh or whatnot, I was not expecting to have vegetables in our course, especially when they charge for $185 for tasting menu. I am here to eat sushi, not vegetables..3. menu clearly said we will be serving 18 courses, but we only got 17 food courses (6 sushi, 1 foie gras, 3 vegetables, 5 sashimi, 1 wagyu and 1 dessert - as you can see in my pictures). I wonder if they count 1 pairing sake drink we received as one of their tasting menu, then this place is totally a scam. sake doesnt count as food. also sake did not taste good at all. It smelled like soy sauce.. also missing shrimp in omakase? hmmm... 4. We ended up spending $600, 2 x 18 courses, 4 drinks, tax and tips.. but we weren't full at all.. We had to go to different restaurant because we were so hungry and spent more money there.5. They should definitely reduce their price based on what they serve here. I get that they serve A5 wagyu, etc.. but still.. $185 is way too high. maybe $100-125 is fair. What a disappointment we had on Friday night. I will email the restaurant manager/owner to see why we were only served 17 food courses. I have been to Sushi Nakazawa many many times (which also means I do not mind spending $$$ on expensive sushi), but I wouldn't come back to this restaurant!.Edited for mistakes: Okay so I've heard about this place for a bit and it has been on my bookmarks for quite some time. We finally decided to visit and I'm going to put it out there, this place is a solid 3.5. This place is part of a hotel so you'll get the benefit of space. It's roomy and is visually appealing. But if you're a traditional sushi guy, turn the other way now. This place is more about the sauces and modern techniques than traditional flavors and fresh fish. O-ya utilizes high end ingredients with modern flavors and taste. You'll get less wasabi and more truffle oil and foams. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's not traditional sushi. They also start you out on the hot fishes in the omakase which is almost always reserved until the end. In fact, the eel piece was so hot that it burned our tongue. Overall the flavors were great. The presentation was a bit awkward due to the distance between the bar and the work area. And your sushi chefs were Chinese, not Japanese. In fact, there were no Japanese staff at all. My favorite pieces were the mushroom, the foie gras, and the wagyu. The uni was from Maine so there was nothing special on that front. The aged sake was delicious. Overall the staff was very nice and the effort was great. But for $555 after tax and tip, which includes two 18 piece omakase, 2 beers, and 2 teas; I'd say save your money and go elsewhere. Sorry but O-ya is more like an O.Okay so I've heard about this place for a bit and it has been on my bookmarks for quite some time. We finally decided to visit and I'm going to put it out there, this place is a solid 3.5. But since that's not available, they'll get a 4 for effort.

Sorry but O-ya is more like an O-No..Over thanksgiving my sister talked about how much she loved O Ya, even going as far as saying this was probably the best meal she's had last year. We decided to stop by on a Friday and the whole place was packed. We had the 18 piece omakase and every piece was uniquely deliciously and lovely in presentation. The menu seemed well thought out and delicately executed. We really enjoyed our dinner and the exceptional service. I think everyone should experience a dinner at O Ya at least once - it'll be memorable to say the least!.Amazing service and the food was pretty food, but I found the sushi too dressed up with large pieces of truffle and other additions that took away from the fish. This is definitely not your traditional sushi place. For instance, I didn't like that our sushi pieces often came around the back through the kitchen rather than right from the sushi chef sitting in front of you. It was a little odd to be honest. But 5 stars for the amazing service from our awesome waiter who put together a fantastic birthday dessert as a surprise for my friend!"
"Every previous negative review about food and service is absolutely wrong.Our waiter and every single person who served us in this restaurant was attentive to everything we needed. Our water glasses were always full, new utensils were given after every meal, and even our table was cleaned post course.Nevertheless, the food was delicious and each course seemed carefully made with love. We went for the 4-course option each and had the beef tartare, salmon, truffle gnocchi, carbonara, duck, and branzino. To topit off we chose the chocolate torte and crème brûlée.The Pinot Noir was 5-stars and the Negroni was so smooth, I didn't even know I was drinking hard liquor. We were treated with an espresso martini split in half for my fiancé and I to drink, and complimentary pistachio ice cream to top it off!5/5 stars. This is fine dining and exquisite food at its best..Maybe I shouldn't compare American Michelin star to European. Maybe I should learn to expect less living in Houston and having lived in New Orleans. But very little about this food and nothing about this experience was worthy of a Michelin star. Service was very rushed and not exceptional. Our water was always full. And if the goal was to get in and out, as I suppose may be the case with locals, they succeed. But it's not enjoyable to feel rushed through a meal, which in the end was nearly $900 for 3 people. The food was good. But the only thing that was truly incredible was the cream cheese ice cream with dessert. The  branzino was good, but not even top 5 fish entrees I've had. My friends had the char and venison. Both good but not great dishes. The fondant potatoes outshined the stars of the dishes. I'm not upset that I chose Bâtard, but I would not go back or recommend it to anyone else..Had a really wonderful experience here. The first thing that stood out was the no-frills elegance of the space. The dining room is gorgeous, and it feels subtly luxurious with its gold wallpaper. Sort of a modern take on what it feels like to be in Bemelman's. The service followed suit. The food itself also didn't disappoint. Fairly straightforward renditions of French classics, done with a a tinge of flare. Enjoyed the salmon appetizer, and the beef entree -- though, neither wowed me. The sticky pudding, on the other hand, did. These all came off the Restaurant Week menu, and I'm interested to see how it compares to the full menu whenever I return..So we we tried out their restaurant week menu, and to be honest most of the items were a bit disappointing. Our favorites were highlighted in this video: the sticky toffee pudding and the salad lyonnaise. Their cured salmon just tasted like something from a grocery store and the dorade and braised beef were good but nothing exceptional. Cocktails were also fine. Maybe their regular dinner menu is more intriguing. Probably a 3.7/5, may return when I'm feeling particularly rich to try their regular menu.I will say that their service was impeccable and the rolls and butter that was provided was lovely.We do live in Las Vegas where fancy dining lives. HahaThis place was recommended by our concierge at the hotel.  We were probably too last-minute and can't get into most restaurants on my list. Anyways, the appetizer looks fancy and the liver mouse were nicely decorated.  The mouse however is super soft and I wasn't crazy about the crunchiness.   But I understand the needs to have a full balanced palette profile.  The main course pasta was disappointing for me.  The flavor is just off for me somehow.  The fish sole also had a interesting flavor that wasn't appetizing for me. Again, maybe I am being too picky for the price here.   Everything here are definitely not for people on diet haha. Lots of cheese and butter in every single dish..Came here for a dinner with two friends and really enjoyed the experience and food!Service was impeccable, but the highlight for me was the food. I got the cured salmon which was super fresh, the addition of the caper berries and pumpernickel made it even better.For the main, I got the branzino which was superb! The zaatar spice and chermoula panissr were absolutely perfect with the white dish.Finally, I got the seasonal dessert which was the pumpkin cheesecake. It was well made, and the addition of the vanilla orange ice cream on the side complimented the dish well.Also, for drinks, they have a nice mocktail selection if you don't drink alcohol which I really enjoyed.Only downside is that the place got super loud post 7:30 pm but otherwise, the experience was very lovely!.Bastard is back. I am thrilled to visit here after Covid. Place has mixed reviews due to their service. I think I know the reason. But I want to share my little insights on Batard. Food is exceptional. They are trying to accommodate all people where they offer 2 courses, 3 courses and 4 courses. We had 3 courses with beef tartar, curated salmon as appetizers, risotto and pasta as appetizer and entree of venison and strip brass. We skipped dessert but I bet it's good. We are amazed by each of the dish where you can visually see the textures. Service: service is actually good but they do try to expertise u to finish fast. Overall: it's a great experience for a one star Michelin star restaurant. Go take ur date and enjoy the night..If you have the chance to eat at Bátard, you are in luck. From the intimate setting, to the detailed designs of the walls, Bátard sets the table for a unique dining experience. Also a solid wine collection. From the start, the appetizers are all delicious. We ordered a great variety of them, and my favorite included the salmon and the soup. Likemost places, they also included complementary bread and butter as well.For entrees, I got the duck which was so tender. The best part though was the yogurt beet sauced mixed with it as the flavors complemented the sauce well. The chicken is also supposed to be classic staple!Of all the desserts, the chocolate candy bar one was by far my favorite. Very unique and had a nice crunch with every bite.Bátard is perfect for a fancy night out and hope to visit again soon!.Their old fashion is amazing. Great for the price point. The waiter was also amazing. Not sure if I made the right choice not having the duck. Looked amazing. Deserts were all good as well..Excellent food and service at a very reasonable price. I was very impressed by the beef tartare followed by the pork chop with eggplant ratatouille, both of which were exceptional. Service was top-notch, and was almost too good with our waiter constantly making sure that we were taken care of.Came here for a date night, and Bátard definitely provided the kind of atmosphere that we were looking for. The restaurant provided an intimate dining setting with creative and well-executed dishes."
"...what is this, this is gorgeous, I recognize only the perfect tiny radish, but what is this pale green disc, what, cucumber or gelee, and this fuzzed sphere, did he call it rabbit shoulder rolled in basil, but why then this silky texture, and this glistening cylinder surely is the cuttlefish, but no, it gives like sashimi but it hits like rabbit, it's the rabbit loin, but how, or is the rabbit note coming from this deeply flavored jus, but I thought it was supposed to be carrots, or was it lapsang souchong...I have never felt less well-equipped to review a restaurant than for Corton.I usually go course-by-course when describing a tasting menu, but I do not think I can even capture a *single* one of Corton's dishes in words. One menu description: ""Foie gras and peekytoe crab wrapped in red cabbage gelee, vinaigrette of opal basil scented with violet mustard, fresh elderberry salad."" It turns out the ingredient lists are not just unenlightening but misleading, since each dish had at least 3 additional unlisted elements.Besides, even if I told you that almond creme and ramp mayonnaise and lemon olive oil jam and white beer sorbet and nasturtium petal gelee and chartreuse all showed up... What would that say, really? That chef Paul Liebrandt is a drunk with a dartboard?Hardly. It is intensely cerebral food. Strange flavors materialize from nowhere, then dissipate like wisps of smoke. It was like hearing a work of difficult literature as an audiobook you aren't able to rewind: you sense the themes are there, the connections between disparate elements, but everything is passing so quickly, and you can't go back to appreciate the beauty of the sentences, or indeed even form a well-founded opinion on whether they're beautiful at all.That there is design behind the madness is never in doubt. But I spent the meal trying to figure out whether it was more like James Joyce's Ulysses -- dense with allusion and self-reference and complex pleasures -- or Finnegans Wake -- gratuituously impenetrable, willfully unknowable, and to many reasonable people ultimately pointless. I'm still not sure.One thing is certain: there are effects occurring on those plates that happen nowhere else around town. How can the heat of a wasabi sorbet take a full five seconds to arrive after it hits the tongue? Yet it does. How can that opening paragraph above represent not a cacophonous conglomerate of notes, but something more akin to an intensely curated orchestral tone poem? Yet it does.I've moved from literary to musical analogy, mixing metaphors in the process. (One hardly curates a musical piece.) No accident: I have to reach, imperfectly, towards the nonculinary arts to capture something of the Corton experience. Most of the tasting menus around town are putting novel twists on familiar flavor combinations or elevating ingredients past their usual breaking points to achieve something new yet grounded. Liebrandt is doing something different. Corton hews to none of the standard evolutionary rays: classical tradition, molecular gastronomy, pseudocounterculture hipsterification. It exists in a different dimension.Which is not to say a different level. Anyone who calls this meal their favorite in NY is one of two things, or possibly both: 1. a liar, 2. a pretentious git. Corton is not about elevation to transcendence. Do not come expecting that. It is about taking you to a different place altogether. That the ""fairy tale of Aubergine and Caviar"" was served on a plate reminiscent of an extraterrestrial landscape cannot be a coincidence. I arrived, explored, and left confused and dazzled and enervated. I wasn't even sure I enjoyed it.But I wanted to go back.Probability of return within 1 year: 5% (I didn't say I have the money to go back.).Meh..I've been to Corton twice, once when I knew the sommelier/beverage director and once when I did not. I think it's really telling that both experiences were equally great. So, you don't have to be an ""insider"" to get really great service and amazing food. Although, you probably do have to be willing to drop some cash, but I think that goes without saying.Chef Liebrandt runs an impressive show here, it was an amazing adventure with each course. The ""garden"" dish is particularly delicious; the truffle pasta was amazing. The food ""experiments"" are spot on in their unique flavor combinations. Really impressive wine list, but I'm definitely biased. ;)Totally recommended. Jean-Georges (main dining room) remains my favorite restaurant in the city, but new(ish)-comer Corton surely gives them a run for their money..Part 3 of a Series: The PMD Chronicles (How I Fell in Love with a Murderer)The mood: a stormy Wednesday evening, 9pm. TriBeCa streets are darkened and glistening. Abel Ferrara would definitely be shooting tonight. The setting: a white room without windows, with more empty tables than full ones. Those that are occupied seem to be filled with either the typical ""older man/younger woman"" combination that is so frequent when the man has money, or the ""older man/older woman"" combo that just naturally happens as time cruelly moves forward. The tables are covered in white cloths and bedecked with tiny glass vases housing fresh exotic flowers.The characters: a lovely young woman, covered in tattoos, and her handsome prince consort. He is not tattooed but he has the murderous madman gleam in his blue eyes. Did I mention that he's handsome? The food: select from one of two set menus - a five course ""Summer"" menu, or a nine course Tasting menu. The server suggests going with the former, and tacking on additional dishes from the latter. Nopey! Instead, the couple selects the nine course Tasting menu (155$ each), inquiring if the Wagyu beef course from the Summer menu could be added. The server blanches and says that due to the late hour, it might not be possible as the Tasting menu runs three hours.The drinks: A beer is poured for the handsome man, a rum cocktail is crafted for the lovely lady. Upon finishing them, they decide to share a half bottle of wine, not wanting to get too inebriated so they are able to enjoy the meal fully.The food (part 2): The amuse is charming, including a delicate little nugget of potato that needs to be eaten in one bite; if not, the molten cheese interior will dribble down your chin ungainly (she learns this the hard way and needs another napkin). The feast begins: it is fancy, each course plated intricately with tweezers and deft fingers. Gelees are rampant, broths and sauces are poured table side. Gold leaf flecks tiny squares of unidentifiable morsels. Additional plates house other components of the course. At one point, there are literally eight plates on the table between two people.The food (part 3): Despite the alleged time constraint, the kitchen sends out a complimentary tenth course, the Wagyu beef. It is delicious. It is appreciated.The food (part 4): Desserts are beautiful and complex. This is savaged, as you may view from the photograph uploaded. Details are hazy at this point, for it is late. The lady requests that the mignardises be packed to go.The service: Not particularly impressive, save for the food runners who are friendly. Explanations of each dish are rushed and superficial, a shame when there are nine courses of complex composition and components.The damage: two Tasting menu at 155$ each, cocktail at 16$, beer around 10$, wine somewhere in the 35$ region and you've got yourself a 500$ dinner after tax and tip. Is it worth it? That's for you to decide. Our lady and gentleman are not particularly impressed.The aftermath: our characters return to the W Hotel where a bottle of Veuve Clicquot awaits them in the room's mini refrigerator, and porn movies are at the ready to be watched. Clothing is doffed, blood is shed; thankfully, the W provides a gleaming silver bucket to capture the runoff. (What do you mean that's for ice?).Paul Liebrandt just might be one of the most brilliant and progressive chefs in NYC. Corton was one of those amazing surprises that we didn't see coming. Like many of the great two star Michelin places, which seems to be the most exciting categorizations of restaurants currently, it's an experience in non traditional flavor profiles, semi experimental techniques, and precision. Comparisons would be Momofuku Ko, Coi, Manresa, La Terraza Del Casino..I could go on and on.From the nondescript entry, to the stark shades of white of the dining room, it  proved to be much cozier and quaint than I expected. We were going to do the tasting menu but due to my friends dietary restrictions we had to create our own prixe-fixe instead. Dishes had:""From the Garden""Young Vegetables, Herbs of the SeasonSummer SeaKusshi Oyster | Pecan, Smoked Quail ToastPeekytoe Crab, Almond Ice Cream, Mirai Corn GazpachoAyu, Wild Spinach, Garlic FlowersCannon of LambSmoked Eggplant, Baby Leeks, Crab Apple GeléeRabbit Rabbit Loin/Liver, Diver Scallop, Artichoke, Sweet potato, and Albufera sauce""Gold Bar""Pedro Ximénez, Smoked Caramel Ice CreamSesameApricot, Yuzu | Buttermilk Granita, LycheeEverything was fantastic. This might have been one of the most eye opening and satisfying meals I've had recently. I'm very big on new experiences and the way the food was put together here, it definitely caught us. The servers are quite friendly and the service is comfortable. I felt no snobbishness here. Heading over to the restroom, I walked into the kitchen by mistake and almost ran into Chef Liebrandt himself, who directed me to the correct door. I think places like this are so progressive that most diners either come away completely excited or they just don't get it. If you're a fan of chefs who push the envelope and think of cuisine in a very different way, I'd highly recommend Corton to attain a very new culinary experience..A cold January night, nothing to do, money I don't have burning a hole in my pocket,  why not go to Corton... Last time I was there they treated me like a king, seems like a good idea, a good way to spend a couple hours... I was planning on getting the 3 course menu, but on the evening's tasting menu were listed some extremely appealing entries -- holy cow, holy hell, whoa, wow -- this is now my favorite restaurant, I want to eat every meal here.They start you out with an insanely good oyster, and bread with seaweed butter which gets better and better with each and every bite... The cassoulet (containing cocoa beans, pheasant leg, chorizo, black winter truffles, black trumpet mushrooms, black olives, and a poached quail egg, among other things) was jaw-droppingly heart-stoppingly delicious -- and it came as a side for a truly spectacular pheasant breast dish, both of these counted as one course, six more remained... The sweetbread was phenomenal, covered in burrata cheese, a perfectly prepared clove of black garlic, it was very beautifully presented... The sea urchin with white sturgeon caviar and konbu gelee and cauliflower foam literally took my breath away, this dish was served to me the last time I was here and it was stunning then, but this time it really knocked my socks off... The John Dory dish was very original, came with anjou pear and a scallop and lots of creative flourishes... The first dessert, sort of, Brilliat Savarin was terrific, the cheese itself was extraordinary, came with a chickpea chip and sour-cherry pate and a bit of delectable celery root paste...The orange cream dessert was a masterpiece of construction, dozens of layers of ingredients at varying temperatures and textures and densities, they all blended together magnificently... The gianduja palette was savory and luscious... For free, for some reason, they desided to bring me a duo of brioche -- which were absolutely smashing, one was white and the other was black, the dish itself was exquisitely presented and beautiful... Then came all kinds of complementary sweets, a delicious salty caramel macaroon, a phenomenal yuzu and juniper chocolate, a divine madras curry chocolate, truffles, ""effervescent crisps,"" and a little folded bag of cookies to take home with you... I tried an incredible tequila, a marvelous bourbon, and then the Sommelier (Elizabeth, who is extremely beautiful and almost unbelievably friendly) presents me with a very generous ""sample"" (which was, basically, a full glass) of a sublime Pinot Noir (I checked the menu, it was the most expensive by-the-glass wine) on the house!The service here is impeccable, the atmosphere is incredibly relaxed, the space itself is gorgeous -- this is the place for me -- I cannot wait to return..Walking by one quiet evening I looked into the window and said ""wait a minute, what happened to Montrachet?"" It turned into Corton, a much more beautiful space and a much more wonderful place...  I celebrated turning 28 here (HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME); they treated me like a celebrity... I love the design and decor, it's uber-comfortable, elegant yet casual, approachable but also appropriate for very special occasions. I find the place very warm, even romantic. There's no music, there's no pretense or fussiness, there's just a lot of nice people doing their best to show you a good time... As for the food, I don't think it's intended to send you to Nirvana (although I was and then some), I think it's meant to be really good ingredients prepared extremely well that you can (and really want to) eat frequently -- I honestly think they created Corton as somewhere people will want to visit again and again, where people who don't necessarily want ""a huge ordeal"" can find amazing food and be guaranteed a terrific experience.Perhaps my review is a bit premature, because I haven't had everything on the menu -- but thanks to the minimalism of the menu I've had at least half of everything. There is a 3 course pre-fixe and a 7 course tasting menu, I had the latter (and a little bit more)... Amuse-bouche: An oyster (perhaps the best I've had in at least a year, and I eat a lot of oysters quite often) in liquids, I was too excited to eat it to hear what exactly everything was -- super delicious... First course: Uni (perhaps the best I've had in years, and this is a favorite ingredient of mine which I eat as often as possible) with Konbu Gelée and Cauliflower Foam -- a perfect dish presented on a beautiful plate... Second course: Ocean Trout Ballotine with White Sturgeon Caviar and Sake Crème -- comes with some micro-thin shavings of something resembling seaweed and a single Concord grape that was an interesting touch making for a truly delectable dish... Third course: Turbot with a Spiced Almond Crust and Black Garlic (which I believe was braised in clove), and a side dish of the most perfect Gnocci I've ever had that came in an luscious sauce with perfectly crispy bokchoi and what I think was pancetta -- this was a home run, bordering on divine... Fourth course: Scottish Red-legged Partridge (PHENOMENAL) on a red cabbage Gelee and Quince, with a side dish of Leg 'Royale,' (SPECTACULAR) on a bed of mouth-watering perfectly crispy and soft polenta -- it was sublime, at this point details get fuzzy for me because I was in absolute awe/ecstasy... Fifth course: Brillat-Savarin with Sour Cherry Pâte de Fruit and a Chickpea crisp -- an exquisite cheese and a great concept to bring you back down to earth from the preceeding dish... Sixth course: Crème' Cake with Amaretto, Orange, and Vanilla-Tamarind -- this was the only dish that was this elaborate, but everything worked very well, it was very gratifying... Seventh course: Gianduja Palette with Yuzu and Coconut  -- at this point I was a little bit overwhelmed, but it was extremely scrumptious... And then they brought out a complimentary dessert, a truly titillating and fantastic Bitter Chocolate Fondant with Hazelnut and Warm slightly-salty Milk, I'm not really a chocolate person and by this point I'd had my fill of desserts, but with this dish I was in heaven... The wines, I don't really remember -- I was too focused on the food, and I gave the Sommelier (Elizabeth, who is impossibly friendly and helpful) carte-blanche -- but everything was outstanding, in particular a 1988 Sauternes... One reason I chose this place, beyond the look of the outside which completely made my heart melt, was because of the extremely simple yet thoughtful and well-chosen beer and cocktail list  -- Orval, Hitachino White, Rogue Dead Guy, Schneider Edel-Weisse (four of my absolute favorite beers), and two brilliant gin drinks (Plymouth with Q Tonic, and Hendricks with St. Germain Liqueur and Japanese Cucumber -- the latter, The Vert, is my new favorite drink, I will head all the way down to Corton especially for it, it's stupendous)... Corton is a remarkably excecuted and thoroughly-thoughtout restaurant, from the carpets to the walls to the lighting to the exposed kitchen to the plates and wine-glasses and bar-area and coat-check and bathroom to the service to the host to the fabulous cooking techniques and the astoundingly amiable chef to the superb location... I'm very glad I chose Corton for my ""special day"" and I cannot wait to return -- I have my heart set on the 3-course tasting menu..Rant first: People need to research where they are eating before they go and to say a place is ""bad"" because you are not the upscale dining type and or you didn't expect it to be full tasting menu is like saying ""I hate this club because I don't want to dress up and i like dive bars"" Well if you don't like upscale dining or full tasting menus then don't go to them. It is not as crazy fancy as Eleven Madison but this tribeca gem's decor is similar to a midtown upscale restaurant with spacious couch seating, minimum decor and light neutral color/lighting.  Last night's dinner was very nice (I think just one notch away from amazing).  Only complaint of the place was AC was pretty high so initially it felt a bit colder than comfortable. Note that menu is seasonal and subject to change:There are three amuse bouches courses, pardon me for not remembering the long descriptions but basically there are some interesting toasted ravioli, some cream ball of potato which was delightful and a seaweed based puff.  The Black bean with corn soup was ok, a bit messy because the bean paste can get on your hands pretty easily.  then there was some kind of tar tar with peppered lime drizzle which was very nice. We opted for the Autumn shorter tasting due to a late start.  First course was heirloom tomatoes with a wonderful plum sauce, baby radishes and a side dish of some amazing sheep's milk ice cream, pepper and ajo blanco.  The first dish was a good start, seemingly simple but they used a lot of different techniques to create the texture and flavor which I appreciated. (reminds me of eleven Madison and recette type of amazing dishes)Second monkfish course was very good.  The fish was nicely seared with some artichoke sauce and amazingly soft artichoke with onion crisp. which is pretty awesome.  Side dish is a thin brown crepe with some steamed baby veggies and some pretty tasty sauce. We had the choice between beef or hen and i choose beef.  The plate presentation makes it almost looks like a serving of chocolates.  All the items lined up from the Wagu beef topped by a truffle blackened spongy bread, then the brunt eggplant, onion, some interesting foam held by another veggy little dish and a piece of the short rib. with vingerete garnish. it was a lovely and thoughtful combination of texture. side dish is i think pineapple crisp on top and some kind of puree belowThe mellon dish was a bit ridiculous with a LOT of foam on top.. i mean you can practically have a bubble bath in it.  but tasted very crisp and was interesting with the Riesling ice cream. The sesame ice cream dish was another wonderful focus on one thing but different flavor and texture from ice cream to pudding type to cream.And of course to end with the all you can eat macaroons and chocolate petti fours were pretty awesome.. Pimms macaroons?? AMAZING!!! rootbeer truffle is also very good.  Dark chocolates are always my fav.  By the end of the night we drank 6 bottles of wine, three white and three red, as they have a very nice wine list for the wine lovers.  I had a good experience, the tasting is reasonably priced and is more impressive than other restaurants' tasting of the same price range ~100 per head without beverage..Brought here by my high school amigo, Cliff, who has much more fine dining experience than me, frequenting places such as French Laundry. The restaurant itself is quite bleak, with is barren white walls. But I guess that focuses your attention to company and your edible canvas.My palate relishes the chef's palette. The first course Goghes straight to my heart instead of dilly-Dali-ing with uncertainty. My core Screamed with excitement while I Munched on my main course. Finally, a dessert I Will not Rafuse.Overall impressionalism:Decor is minimalistTextures are abstract.Overall good value for your Monet comparative to other fine dining options in the city..The atmosphere and vibe are inviting but the real draw at Corton is its inventive and intricate food. The tasting menu is just that - the chef provides a big enough portion to get a good flavor and look at what is a magnificent plate but not enough so that you have too much of it. In fact, as each course is cleared, the diner is left wanting a bit more but the taste on the palate remains. The staff is attentive and helpful and serves to enhance the meal. Great, although pricey, wine list but the sommelier is helpful and knowledgeable. Either tasting menu is a good choice!.Came here for Valentine's Day this year. Had reservations for one of the first seatings of the night. I was really anxious to try this place. Having watched the documentary about Corton and Paul Liebrandt's A Matter of Taste, I had a feeling this place was going to be good. We had the tasting menu. Let's face it, if you're going to eat at a Michelin that you haven't tried before, you're going to want to try it all. A couple of months down the road I can still remember some notable dishes, like the amuse bouche OYSTER BERNAISE STUFFED CRACKER and the POTATO CROQUETTE. The APPLE WASABI W/ GOLD LEAF was really refreshing. The SWEETBREAD SANDWICH changed my negative past experiences of sweetbread dishes. And the PETIT FOURS? There was so much given to us, it was more like petit twenty-eight!Our overall dinner was pleasant. Definitely worth the cost, but to be honest, there's a reason why this place remains a two and not a three star Michelin. That 'wow' factor was definitely not there.3.5 stars."
"the first moment you walk in, you can't help but notice the funky setup of the dining room and the strange sense that you've just walked in on a conversation: it's a quiet place with lots of nooks and crannies for a couple on a date. as for the food, it's nothing short of fantastic--i had a superb amuse bouche of grilled scallop with red wine glaze, a great plate of foie gras three ways, and an entree of lobster steamed with wild mushrooms. the chef also sent out a random extra course of fresh pappardelle with shaved truffles--so be nice to your waiter and he'll be nice to you. as for the wine list: i've never seen its equal. there's an absolutely stunning selection of burgundies, both horizontal and vertical (i counted fourteen vintages of one particular producer's chassagne-montrachet), coupled with a good mix of other french regions. the sommelier is also quite helpful--if he helps you out, don't forget to tip him! one warning: the bill, the waiter's tip (admittedly generous) and the sommelier's tip added up to $500 for two of us, and it just as easily could've been $5000 with that wine list.....You've killed the rabbit; now do something w/ its fur already!I went to this very pricey, deniro owned french restaurant.  The food was spectacular, the five course meal included very traditional french paired with exceptional wines.  This is the place to go to for fine, french cusine but only if you have cataracts above a fine pallet. The decor was hidious and at the price range, unforgiving.    It may be less expensive to hop on a jet and go to the countryside btwn switz/france and eat at the domaine de chateauvieu."
"Food is terrific. Order in advance..Best Glatt kosher takeout food in the Bronx. If you're in the area, definitely check them out!!.I had their catered foods for the Pesach seders this year. The gefilte fish and chopped liver were both very good, although the liver seemed to not be so fresh. The best thing they made for us was the matzah farfel kugel. This was delicious, slightly sweet, and had mushrooms, celery, and red peppers. The cole slaw was also very good, and was creamy and sweet, just how I like it. The brisket was okay, although a little on the tough side, not very tender. All under the Vaad of Riverdale supervision. The potato kugel was also good..The name should be changed to ""Feed It To the Dog.""  The food's not only lousy and strangely much too sweet, but, yup, it's also ridiculously expensive..Take out food shop that seems to have greatly increased its offerings since the last time I browsed through. Got two chicken legs that were delish. Tasted just like mom's. Bought some hamantaschen too (just to try and help me check out this place even though it's been here for a long time) and it's pretty good, for store-bought..We had a great Shabbat by purchasing their frozen chulent. They gave us a discount for Friday, and they seem to have a broad range of fresh kosher fare at reasonable prices. We're definitely going back... also look for their specials on Challah and Challah rolls, which were a steal..Great take out food, fresh daily, out of a small place. I love the sugar free coleslaw and rotisserie chicken, and the cauliflower souffle and broccoli souffle are gluten free and delish! Best service, always with a smile."
"If you are looking for fresh Caribbean style bread in the Bronx, Cholo is the place to go.  They have them in small and large, and white bread and wheat bread, which is good. The best part of the bread is the end (nipple).  They also make their sweets on premises which is a plus.  The coconut rolls are a must try, and do run out quick, as well as their currant rolls.The only CON is that they are closed on Sundays, so the best advice is if you want bread for the following work week, go on Saturday afternoons..The wait was long even though there were only 3 customers and 1 left. The young man who served us took his time. 20 minutes later we left with our items. I drove an hour to get there"
"Visited this strip club with another couple. We enjoyed the music and the ladies were gorgeous. Most of them had augmented bodies, but really nice and were all over us since we had table service. It was a chill Saturday. And it was really empty when we arrived after 1:00am. But, overall we had a nice time..This had to be the worst club I have ever been to. The cover was $40 after 12. Their is no place to sit down. Took about 30 mins before a bartender even asked if I wanted a drink. All the girls are full of plastic and are sitting around and having hooka. Never was offered a dance. Would give zero stars if possible..This was a great night with friends in celebration of a birthday. When we arrived the bouncers were cool and joking around. There was an entrance fee and I believe it was $40. As you walk in there was food for sale. We sat in the VIP area and had hookah and bottles. We came prepared with our own dollars after reading some of the reviews to prevent any mishandling during a cash exchange. The dancers stay dressed and do not show any nudity. They will make their way to your section  and ask to puff on your hookah and sometimes for a drink. They were extremely friendly. The exchanges were different depending on the dancer. One dancer was extremely thankful for the cash, another ogled like she wanted you to pick her but all of them were friendly. Some bodies, I think 2, were a-la-natural. The rest had butt, boobs, or face jobs. The in house bouncer was a bit much but didn't cause us to have a bad night. It was a good night with good company and entertainment..Nasty M.... f... bouncers at this place! Just to try to get in you are treated like garbage like if the hate you for coming to expend your money!To make matters worse they scan you ID with a device that can storage all of your personal information. The very next day I was at that place my name and information was use to open 11 credit cards!!! That's identity theft! Guys don't let these criminal still your life at these clubs.The manager at this club is racist he's Spanish and will only hire Spanish girls..People have said this before but now I have experienced this myself don't understand why people still support this club oh because it's not on a big platform yet...This place is a hot mess! Yes, if you're a woman of color the bartenders will treat you how they looked pre-surgery, UGLY. Usually strippers who literally have to create bodies black women naturally have are alot more entertaining, not these women. Nothing entertaining, bland, and simply tired. I was bored to death on a Saturday night. One bartender in particular was so disgustingly rude, she basically refused to serve my friends and I and asked us to move so she could ""serve."" The funny thing was she screwed herself because we wanted bottle service and had more money to spend than I'm sure she made that night. Checa? The strippers on the floor were aggressive but sweet. Sadly I noticed that same bartender barely had any clients in the area she was ""serving"" and it's obviously because of her nasty attitude. We took our raks to the girl down the bar from her who was much more pleasant. The security takes pictures of your ID.... Incredibly suspect. I've been to strip clubs all over the US and have NEVER had security pat me the way theirs did. I'm big on the safety myself but damn it's boarder line violating. Absolutely not worth the $40 cover. Save yourself a trip and go some place more diverse, fun and upscale. This place clearly has a type, and it's poorly executed..First time visiting because of the glamorous ""Starlets"" that's promoted via social media. This place is a HOT ASS MESS. Definitely a whole in the Wall. Admission was 40.Valet was 50 dollars. (No one parked the car either, we did so ourselves) This place needs renovation badly. It looks like a smoke shack and the VIP sections look disgusting. Bottles were about 350. The bartenders are very pretty but have a ""boujie"" attitude. Mind you they have no reason to because their customer service sucks ass. They're all on their phone, snap chatting and also setting their own prices for drinks. 15 dollars I was charged for a drink and it was watered down like shit. Mind you these girls are drinking behind the bar and asking us to ""repeat ourselves"" while taking drink requests. The dancers were 6/10. Their asses look disgraceful and many of them can't even dance. They just walk around grabbing the pole and laying on the floor. I also saw the bartenders picking up money that the strippers were getting. They threw most of the 1's on the floor for them to pick up and threw a few on stage for the dancers. That's whack as fuck! Words of advice and improvement: TRAIN YOUR STAFF TO BE POLITE AND OUTGOING NOT STUCK UP LIKE THEY RUN THE DAMN PLACE. Pretty ladies can't be cute with an ugly personality! I would suggest everyone visit to have their experience but I will not visit again until they do some re evaluations..Not sure why there are sooo many bad reviews...I had an awesome time at this club, but it was my first ""strip club"" experience, so I guess I have nothing to compare it to...Entrance is $30 regardless of if you are a guy or girl which was annoying but whatever I paid it. We got there around 1AM so not sure if it's free/cheaper before that. When you walk in, there is a big circle bar with the stage in the middle. Some of the dancers sucked and looked bored out of their minds, but most were good. Pretty good looking dancers too...but of course there were a few who were beat. The bartenders were hot and were actually really friendly. I never had to wait too long for a drink, but be prepared if you're not spending a ton of money on a bottle, they will ask you to move from the bar to make room for those who are. Apparently only people who buy bottles get chairs too, otherwise you will be standing all night. Drinks were pretty weak though for $15.The dancers here don't ever take their clothes off...just dancing in skimpy outfits. Theres three poles on the stage and they rotate out the dancers every so often. Music is really good. The dancers are pretty aggressive and have no problems coming up to you and dancing on you for money. Watching them all scramble for dollar bills reminded me of a bunch of birds when you throw bread crumbs in the park. They literally drop to their knees on the floor trying to pick up as many as they can from eachother. That aside, they were friendly and polite and always said thank you after giving them money. ATM fee was $10 for a withdraw. Bartenders will only give you singles in exchange for $100. I should have read the other reviews first to see if i really did get 100 singles or 90 like others have said. If they give fake dollar bills, who cares...you're spending them on the dancers and drinks anyway lol. I had a really fun time and would return in the future. It's worth a try..I felt super uncomfortable, there were no seats!!! Also the strippers were super awkward and didn't dance. They sat and did hookah..So if your looking for something upscale this isn't it. However the dances are really good. If your not going to tip then don't go. We went kind of early around 10pm for my birthday. We were there until 1, all my money was gone. There was a group of guys watching and not tipping, losers. My girlfriends and I were defiantly tipping and taking care of the girls. Some were actually very nice. I think at least two would jiggle their booty on me. I didn't want a lap dance, So I kindly tipped by putting singles in their thong & said thank you. Not sure if that's weird, but yeah! One let me slap her booty. It was a lot of fun. If your a judge mental person or uptight, then don't go to any strip club. I do have to say all the guys in their were very weird. The bartenders were ALL on their phones, taking selfies and texting. I didn't care, but if that was my business best believe that wouldn't go down. There was one bar tender who had platinum blonde short hair. She took care of us the whole night. Kept asking if we wanted more drinks. Kept giving us singles when we paid (sneaky sneaky). Of course we spent them! I might come back. It was a $10 cover charge. Cost check was mandatory, but I refused. There was hot food, which I would never eat- but I mean it is an option. Overall girls were great, dances had talent."
"What a great find! We were craving comforting Italian and, with so many options in Manhattan, didn't know where to land, but Il Melograno was perfect. It's cozy (only seats about 20 inside) but separated between tables so we felt safe. The service was fantastic: accommodating a late addition to our party AND helping us navigate or create vegan fare. And the pasta was just excellent. We loved the veal ravioli in sage butter the best, but the pesto and veggie was great too. The carpaccio was a generous portion, served exactly right with just oil, cheese, and arugula.The sun dried tomato olive oil with bread service was the secret cherry on top. A surprising delight in Hell's Kitchen, right near where we were staying..Great customer service and even more amazing foods! Highly recommend!I will be going back..Went for dinner with the SO on a Friday night. Their outdoor seating is well constructed and covered but the unseasonably cold weather decided we sit inside. The decor is very cute with lots of well polished wood seating and little fake plants and votives everywhere. Our server was very attentive and helpful with menu recommendations. We started with the beef carpaccio which was delicious, topped with arugula and Parmesan. We also started with some summer cocktails (their whole drink menu is very reasonably priced). For mains we had lasagna and pollo ala Milanese. The lasagna was amazing, the beef and bechamel combo was like ""mom food"" in the best way. We finished the night with a delightfully creamy and coffee-forward tiramisu dessert. Overall this place has good drinks, good food, cute atmosphere and good service. It's a 5/5 in all categories for me. I highly recommend going on your next date or happy hour here, it's a great value and adorable authentic taste of Italy in Midtown!.A great little neighborhood Italian restaurantDon't miss the octopus appetizer!!! The octopus is sooo tender and flavorful. The mandarin salad underneath is also very fresh. One of the best octopus dishes in the cityWine list is great! Lots of great affordable Italian wine choices  The salmon entree I got is good. I do like the fact that the entree comes with cauliflower mash. Service is also attentive and friendly - our server came check on us every few minutes.I will definitely be back to try their pasta.Never thought I'd walk all the way to 10th avenue for dinner, but this one is a gem. Went with my family. We had the angus beef steak, salmon, pasta with ragu sauce and a couple salads. Everything was cooked perfectly and excellent. In particular, we really liked one of the sides that came with the salmon. It was a cauliflower / potato purée, and it had an amazing consistency and taste. We'd definitely make the walk to 10th avenue again next time we are in the city..I'm not usually in this area and that's a shame because if I was, I could eat here so much more! Quintessential Italian. I wasn't able to spend Thanksgiving with family and didn't even make a single Thanksgiving food dish, so my fiancé and I saved our appetites for dinner here the next night. 5/5 stars for service alone. Attentive, friendly and helpful staff. I had reservations for two at 5:30 on a Friday and we were seated at the cutest little table. The inside of the restaurant is intimate and cozy. Smaller than I pictured and honestly that made the experience even better! I would definitely recommend making reservations so you don't have any issues waiting for a table. We stayed for about an hour and a half and never felt rushed. I got the Hugu cocktail which was delicious. We started with the bruschetta and olives. OLIVES ARE SO GOOD. Huge!!! Jumbo green olives. Oh also there was complimentary bread with sun dried tomato olive oil! My fiancé got the veal ravioli for his main and I got the spaghetti. IF THERE IS A SINGLE TAKEAWAY FROM MY REVIEW: THE AMOUNT OF PASTA IS...WOW. I had seen pictures of the spaghetti and thought it might be a fistful of pasta. It's about 4 fistfuls of pasta. Not complaining one bit but I probably wouldn't have ordered the bruschetta had I known. ;)  It was piping hot and very flavorful. Waiters offered us pepper or Parmesan as well. We finished with the lemon sorbet which was simply delicious. Light and refreshing. Lastly, they have a very CLEAN bathroom. I loved this place and will have to make an excuse to visit this part of the city again if only to try a salad next time and maybe some dessert coffee! Thank you!!.Dined here recently and it was great.  Delicious salads and soups to start.  Hearty lasagna and ravioli for our main.  Nice wine selection as well.  Friendly staff and cute indoor decor and outdoor tables..From the same owners as Il Baretto.  Great date spot.  Love their cavatelli with shrimp and pesto, I order it every single time why deviate.   Enjoyed their calamaru, tiramisu and of course a bottle of rose as it was 80 degrees outside..This is, without question, the best Italian food that I have ever had! Gregory and Lino, the owners, were so warm and welcoming and you can tell that they put their heart and soul into this restaurant and its food. Lino told me that the recipes that he uses are his grandmother's recipes from when he was younger in Sicily. He must have been one lucky grandson because the flavor and quality of this food is absolutely superb!We got the Polpo Alla Grigia for the Antipasi and it was absolutely superb. The octopus was soft and perfect. Ot was not fishy and it melted in my mouth. I have no idea how they cook it in such a way that it does not get chewy but I was amazed. The greens and orange fruit mix below are the absolute perfect flavoring combination with the octopus and of optimum freshness.I ordered the Ravioli Di Vitello Al Burro E Salvia and my wife got the Pappardelle Al Ragout Di Salsiccia. I am usually not that impressed with restaurant ravioli for the price but this was the best dish I have ever had in any Italian restaurant. The handmade ravioli melted in my mouth and the cream sauce was the makings of a food magician. My wife's Pappardelle was also one of those dishes that doesn't tend to stand out from restaurant to restaurant but oh boy was that not the case here! The sauce was so fresh and brilliant in flavor and the noodles perfectly cooked down to the second! I have no idea how they made Pappardelle taste like a magical experience like this but my wife stuffed herself until she could not eat another bite.Then came the dessert! The Cannoli Siciliani was also a tastebud party of the finest kind. The perfectly crisp canoli paired with the perfectly balanced and vibrant filling flavor was... perfect! The finishing touch was the candied carmelized orange strip on top that was something straight out of Willy Wonka's magical flavor factory. It was amaaaazing! I was stuffed, my wife was stuffed, and yet we devouered this dessert!The ambiance is absolutely perfect as well. They have these clear window booths decorated with real live potted plants so guests can easily hear their own conversations but have nothing taken from the peaceful decor and ambiance of the restaurant as a whole. You can tell that every last decorative item in this restaurant was hand selected and placed with care.The service was unbeatable. Gregory and Lino were never far off, ensuring that guests received the best. The wait staff was on top of everything: not overly intrusive yet magically knowing when to check in and top off drinks. They were all well groomed and professional.The neighborhood is also pleasant with the restaurant being snuggled within a trendy and upscale part of the edge Hell's Kitchen. It couldn't be placed in a better area of Manhattan.My wife and I will stop here EVERY time that we visit NYC in the future..Dining here was very disappointing. Very. I have no clue why the rating here is so high... I am only giving two stars for service, the food was not good whatsoever. I stopped by with a friend recently for dinner. We shared the burrata and we both got the vegetarian ravioli and lasagna. The burrata was just okay - nothing to write home about. The ravioli was pretty bad - it tasted almost as if the dough wasn't fully cooked. Ravioli from TJ's taste way better! My friend's lasagna looked pretty badly and was barely touched. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this place and won't be back..The food is amazing. If you truly want home made pasta this is the place to come. The service by Leo was awesome. We took our friend for his birthday and truly loved the food and atmosphere. Definitely recommend this place who wants great Italian food."
"This might be my new favorite bar.The space is huge. The bar itself doesn't have a ton of seating, but it's in a cavernous room that has an impressive mishmash of seating options. Couches, tables, booths. There's the fountain, which is large and has two sides to it. The decor is eclectic in a basement storage area way, not in the faux-eclectic way of Applebees. There's a wooden tub, pig statues, fake plants. I get why Jesse said it looks like a Midwestern bowling alley. It's kind of got that vibe. The biggest bonus is that it doesn't feel at all like you're in Midtown.Drafts were $5, which feel like a great deal in Midtown. Plus, there was tons of space. No one bumping into me. No struggle to make it to the bar to get a drink. The bartenders were friendly, as were the guys sitting at a bar, who seemed like regulars. It was very dark in most of the room, but there are big windows and the tables in the back are well lit. And you have access to anything you can buy in a NYC deli. The bathrooms were cleaner than I expected.I used to have a client in the building, so I was here all the time and could have used a drink all the time, but even though there are signs everywhere saying there's seating upstairs, I never checked it out. It's now a regret I have in life..If the concept of a speakeasy and a dive bar had a child, and this is interesting to you, then check up Upstairs Pub. This divey style pub is hidden up the stairs above Everyday Gourmet, right behind the Korean hot food section and completely unexpected.And when I say divey, its like an old bar someone found in a basement and matched it with furniture bought from a mall closing in 1972. The main room is filled with bunch of booths and tables that are supposed to be used for lunch diners, but somehow never are. What is this place good for? Well, do you work in midtown? Need a drink? Don't care about the decor or sometimes lack of service? And do you like a cheap happy hour? Then totally check it out..This place is like a hidden gem. It took me and my friends a few minutes to find and when we finally went upstairs, we had to do a double take to make sure that we were at the right place. The bartender assured us we were and that there was a happy hour (2.25 for blue moons). Honestly, the ambiance is kinda sketchy. It was close to empty and really dark like a club, but instead filled with tables. There were tv's everywhere playing different sporting events/ fights. We got our beers and settled down into a booth. The bartender was great, very attentive. She even gave us a pack of pretzels since we weren't sitting at the bar. The place is a little quiet which makes it perfect for having a conversation with someone over a drink or two. You can bring food up from downstairs, and my friend got a pizza... it was decent. Honestly, once you get over the shadiness of this place, it becomes the perfect place to hang out. It only loses that one star cause of the ambiance and lack of food. I was really craving some fries after all those blue moons, but besides that there's nothing else wrong with this place..Just found my new after work/avoid the crowd spot!Happy hour ends at 7, which is a shame because that's when I get out of work... but I sure wish I could! aA few beers on tap, a bunch more by the bottle, house wines, well drinks, and a small top shelf selection. But who cares? It's cheap.You can bring food from downstairs (by the pound hot buffet food) and come watch the game..This place is so weird but I love it.It's above a deli, first of all. My boyfriend and I found this place a while ago on google or something weird and it took us a long time to figure out where it was. It was a hilarious surprise that it's essentially just the upstairs seating area of a deli. It's HUGE. There are a bunch of booths and a massive set-up of tables and chairs, like a banquet hall. The best part is the one area of benches and chairs around a table that seats a group of like 8. That is the only place you really ever see people sitting, there's barely anyone in this bar ever. Anyway, all the furniture in that area is made of like, polished driftwood. And it's by a waterfall pond thing. I'm not making this up.We always arrive when there's no one in the bar but a group taking that table (damn) and some sketchy people drinking way in the back. Sometimes there's karaoke kind of? People sitting at the bar can sing? You also have a view into what is either an office or a separate karaoke room, my boyfriend and I disagree on what it actually is. The happy hour deal seems incredible but we're never there for happy hour. I guess we just like that this place is weird and hidden and it's never crowded. You could throw a party here for like 50 people, it'd be like a banquet with deli food and possibly karaoke. I'd say go for the happy hour for sure or if you really just want to drink basically anywhere and you think you and your friends would also find this place hilarious. Get the table with the waterfall..This place looks like a Midwestern bowling alley, and I used to love it. But last night, the bartenders told me they ""didn't need my business"" because I asked for a skunked drink to be replaced with something drinkable. And when I pointed out that I'd brought a large crowd to the bar and was a regular, the bartender said ""So you think you deserve a free drink?"" SMH..So yes...this definitely is a weird place.  I came here on a weekday after work with a friend and it was almost entirely empty. There were a couple regulars and thats it.  The bartender seemed to agree the place was ""interesting"" and said it was more crowded on weekends.  One reason I am bumping up my review is because the bartender was really cool and fun to talk to. Their happy hour specials were good- but the selection was average.  Perhaps this is not a fair review as I came at a ""non peak"" time.  But given the location and the general vibe I was getting, I do think there are many better options out there.  It would be cool if they did a makeover - for one, they need more light during their happy hour as I do not think they are getting much demand during the work week at this time.  Right now, it is basically a night club that is waiting for the weekend happen - perhaps if they had a different vibe during the week they would improve their numbers.  Just a thought...This place is somewhat of a hidden area. It is above the Everyday Gourmet Deli. Happy hour specials consist of buying 2 pints or pitchers and getting the third free. Thus, it would be best to go in a small group. The bar is dimly lit  with neon accents and loud music in the background. Beers on tap include Hite, Blue Moon and Sam Adams. Thus, with the pint deal, each pint costs about $2.5-$3.5 (this is an approximation). All right deal, but not great. there are places where you can get $3 bottles. They also serve cocktails and wine. There's plenty of lounge area type seating and booths that can seat about 4 people. There is also a bar area, long tables, and LCD TV's throughout. On this Friday, they offered an open mic karaoke so feel free to ask the DJ to play your favorite song. Overall, good place to enjoy a drink with friends and some food. You can buy food from the deli downstairs and eat it upstars, but there's also a bar menu. Wings are Korean style (double fried) and served with a side of daikon radish. A little pricey-one dozen for $16- but they are a decent size. Flavor is not quite there though. Would come back if I don't feel like dealing with crowds..$2 Draft Beers, $3 Bottle Beers, $5 Wines and $6 CocktailsYummy Wings, and Sandwiches!It can't get any better. Best kept secret  in Midtown NY. Best Deal in NY!.I've got to add this place to my very short list of great New York bars. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is I'm afraid that'll bring the crowds! It's rarely crowded (yo! That's a good thing!) Teddy, the bartender and Sammy the manager make you feel part of the family. The beer is cheap and the pitcher & wings special the best deal. Just finding the place makes you seem like part of a secret club! It has odd hours, based on the weather and the whims of whosever working that night. So if you're coming from aways, you have to take your chances. I'm there at least once a week, so say hi if you show up!"
"I came back for a ham, turkey and american cheese on a hero.Limited amount of steamed table food.not crowed at all..The price keep going up.It is now $7.99 a pound.From the hot and cold buffet, I usually get half a slice of meatloaf, a slice of roast turkey, 5 pieces of pea pod, a small piece of soy sauce tofu, 2 small pieces of whole marinated mushrooms,  a piece of  canned artichoke heart, a piece of canned heart of  palm and a small pile of cold  glass noodles. This is about a pound of food.They have a special for breakfast for $1.25:a butter roll or bagel with a small coffee or tea.the coffee is not bad.They also make sandwiches or burgers to order.There is also sushi, juice, noodle  and a  pizza bar.Tip: if you are on a budget, skip the heavy items( rice, noodle,tomato,potato salad, cole slaw,mashed potato,etc).You don't want to pay $8 a pound for the above.Go for the following items:salmon                                                beef briskit                                                 oxtail                                                 fried chicken                                                 baked shrimp                                                 fried shrimp                                                  meatballs in gravy                                                  baked virginia ham                                                 baked chicken                                                 baked fish.This weekend, my Scrabble club met at this location.   I ordered bacon cheeseburger and waffle fries.   The food was subpar.  I wish the burger had more flavor. The upstairs seating area was interesting.   As another Yelper's review stated it is a combination of  ""abandoned strip mall, the Titanic about to sink, and also a bar with waterfall.""  There was no heat.  The club organizer assumed it was the owner's strategy to have us buy hot drinks.  I would not come back here..Wide spread of food! Convenient as they have a little of everything. The prices are on par as it is getting close to Upper East Side. I got a small seafood gumbo for around $3.99. The upstairs seating area is so interesting. Reminds me of a cross between an abandoned strip mall, the Titantic about to sink, and also a bar with waterfall. Very interesting decor and lots of seating. The service was as usual. Efficient, brisk, yet uninterested. I would come back if in the area and really needed food..If I could give zero stars I would: multiple times I've stood at the sandwich counter for 5 to 10 minutes with no one to even acknowledge me let alone take an order. My last straw, the roaches I saw in the dinning area and near the buffet. Glad I saw them. Officially would never return. Delmonicos is across the street with better food, clean, and ppl to take your order within with first few minutes.Food is delicious, anything from the asian section is. The guys at the deli meats are also very nice and super quick. Before covid they have a nice selection from the hot buffet table but now its very limited due to food safety of course. The coffee here is self serve and you have to make it yourself. The girls at the register however arent so friendly and whenever you call to order for delivery its a hit or miss. You get someone who knows what theyre talking about or you get someone who has no idea what their own menu is and I once had a lady who didnt know what a scallion was.. completely dumbfounded to be honest lol..my friend you need a new job if you work at a food spot and not know what a scallion is. Another thing that Ive always wondered was.. i thought food wasnt taxable but even if there is a rule there was idk how a $12.99 meal gets boosted up to $14 something, like really?! That much tax for food? 3 stars only for the mysterious calculation of $ to the food and the service from cashiers and whomever picks up the phone..Bad customer service.  Rude and not polite.   I was never fond of their credit card minimum charge and used to enjoy the food in the food buffet.  I was not impressed with the rude cashier recently and I will not be back..I work nearby, and about once a month I give this place a chance. The food is okay, and the guys behind the sandwich counter are always nice, but the cashiers are invariably rude and I always leave there with an unpleasant feeling..Straightforward bagels, quick enough if you just want 'em toasted with cream cheese.They get a bit slow if people want fancier items, and honestly the rest of the selection is best described as ample but ordinary..My mother brought her lunch from there on Wednesday at  4:45pm. She works around the area. She ordered a hamburger with onions, lots of lettuce, ketchup, Mayo & pepper. Around 4:30am she begin to feel very SICK. She was weak, dizzy, sweaty,had upset stomach and could barley walk. I took her to the E.R IMMEDIATELY. She was admitted and stayed in the hospital for three days with SEVERE food poisoning. She threw up 7 times! couldn't go to the bathroom on her own, and couldn't walk on her own. My whole family called out of work for three days to care for her. (Money LOST) It's probably gonna take her a week( She's still sick) to eat, walk, and function on her own ALL  BECAUSE OF THIS PLACE!!!!!!! I've never seen my mom so sick! Please BEWARE before deciding to eat here! She is older in age so it hit her hard!.This place is great and their breakfast selection is even better but from what I got today, I was quite disappointed. I ordered an bagel with butter and iced coffee. My coffee tasted sour so that was a disappointment and my bagel was burnt. There was also a piece of lettuce in my bagel. Since when did piece of lettuce come on ""bagel with butter""?"
"I order my coffee and sandwiches from this location very often. I usually get the chocolate chip muffin or the chicken bacon sandwich. They're very quick in preparing your order and the staff and manager are friendly. They arent stingy if you ask for more flavor or sugar or milk in your coffee. I always come in after work which is late and they still welcome you with a smile. I recommend coming here if you want your food or coffee quickly. If they make a mistake or if you make a mistake in your order they dont get upset. They redo the order and the last couple of times they didnt ask for the difference. I love coming here. The service and food is 10/10.Horrible customer service. I was in line for about 10minutes just for ice cream mind you when she was taking my order she didn't let me finish and assumed I was with another family that was in line  as well and left me hanging there.  The manager is useless as well super slow..This is the worse dunkin i have ever been. Staff don't know how to treat customers. I order begal and a coffee from my free beverage from DD perks. But they charge me for my drinks and they said nothing is free. They don't know nothing about the DD perks and coupons, how it works..Place was decorated beautifully. Customer service experience could have been a tad more inviting and attentive. Maybe it's just because the crew is very young. Hope to visit again."
"We came here for lunch and enjoyed a slice a pizza, salmon filet and a Greek salad. The pizza was very good and very large. The salmon filet was very good and seasoned well with sesame and teriyaki. The Greek salad was good but was missing dressing which would have been good to have. Everything was fresh and cooked warmed up in order. Lots of seating upstairs and outdoors..They're accessible if you're walking/shopping on 5th av or hanging in Bryant Park. The End. Yelp said I had to write more so...For the plainest of slices the tag is $6.00. Because it's in the city I knew it was gonna be a bit more than usual but what rock have I been under for this long that slices are now $6.00!?! Now if it was yummy I wouldn't have been on about the price but I really didn't like it. I don't want to say it's the worst I've had but ....The End..Randomly ran into Bravo pizza place and it was so good. I was so tempted to eat all and I had to go gym. Ill come back again before going to gym. Margherita pizza is crunch warm and soft melting when I had a bite. You must try it, cant describe the texture and taste. Best pizza in NY for now! Happy to find this hidden spot!.Okay so this is definitely a tad too expensive for NY pizza ($16.50 for 2 slices and garlic knots) but it's really good at least. If you love cheesy pizza this is a good bet..I don't know what it is about this place. I'm sure there's better and it's not all that easy on the eyes but we always end up back here. It's good pizza and consistent every time we come it's the same..So. Bad. Decided to give this place a try, but boy was I wrong. I ordered two margherita slices and they were just plain awful. The sauce tasted sweet which I found extremely odd and it had what appeared to be little wooden sticks scattered throughout. Not sure what they were trying to accomplish with that, but I never desire to eat wooden sticks on my pizza. Don't go here. I told my co-workers where I went and they said that place is no good. Now I understand..Great Sicilian slice here.  Nice crispy crust on the outside and fluffy on top.  Good sauce as well.  If you are in the mood for a slice it's a good choice..I used to be a huge fan of this place. They had a few locations across the city. Unfortunately, it's been several years since I've been here. I wanted to grab a quick slice before heading back home--the quality of the pizza seems to have deteriorated over the years, but it's still a quality place for some pizza on NYCFYI--it's an $8 minimum to use your card here..I had only been here when absolutely drunk off my ass and thought it was delicious. I've since been here sober and am ranking slightly lower than I would normally (probably more of a 3 star) because I feel lied to lol.I was in the city with my kids looking for a pizza place and happened to have found this place. The line to get food went to the outside of the door so I figured it would be a good find, and I was right.  We got two cheese slices and one onions and pepperoni (yes I know weird lol).  It was delicious!!! Although my cousin would debate that's not NY pizza haha. It was great either way.This is a hole-in-the-wall place. It's jam-packed and there's barely any place to sit. Although we got lucky is that two couples left and we were able to sit in the small table next to the wall. The attendant serving the pizza was super nice and helpful.  The cashier was a little less nice and serious.  He was not smiling and put my sodas on top of the soda machine for me to grab.  I thought that was a little rude because it was too high for me to get them.  For those of you that don't know me, I am petite in stature. I literally had to ask him to grab them for me hahaha. Other than that when join the food and had a good time.  There's plenty of pizza to choose from with all kinds of toppings. They have other food that's not pasta as well. It's worth it for the food. P.S. There is no bathroom so pee before you come here. Haha"
"Pizza so good!Friendly staffOutdoor seating Truffle oil!I literally eat here every single day!.Awesome pizza! Super cute little shop! The pizza was premade and they had it in the case then went and warmed it up. Tasted awesome! Dude working there was nice too. Awesome lunch or drunk food spot :).Friday is pizza night and wanted to order from someplace I haven't been to in awhile. Baker's Pizza is a neighborhood slice shop, but they make great pizzas.I ordered a meatball parm pizza, which was a good change up from the usual margherita or pepperoni. It's a classic New York style pizza topped with pieces of meatballs, smoked mozzarella, marinara, fresh ricotta, and parmesan. It was just the right amount of saucy and cheesy, with a nice chewy crust. Definitely one of my favorite pizza toppings combinations now. I'll be ordering it again soon!.Yelp currently says they're closed, but they are in fact open! Was there tonight. The plain is my favorite in the city for a New York slice, but I'm a huge white pizza fan and I love the white slice at Baker's..Good for people who: like chessBad for people who: are not intellectualsCame here for some pizza after I spontaneously decided to drive to NYC from Philly on a Friday evening to see my friend S. When we walked in we saw 2 people playing chess and I was like oh so am I in Queen's Gambit right now? Apparently if you beat the one guy playing then you could get a free slice of pizza but I haven't played chess since my brother got a Lord of the Rings chess set for one Christmas when we were in elementary school so I passed on the offer. I expected Anya Taylor Joy to show up any minute but I think she was busy or something cuz she didn't come. Pizza was really good and I'm excited to go visit my friend again so I can get some more pizza from here..WHAT PERSON DOESN'T LIKE PIZZA?A weirdough. Grab yours at @bakerspizzanyc for some over the top flavor  Worth the drive from Queens!.Baker's Pizza offers interesting variations of traditional slices. I was very impressed with the toppings and oils they use in their slices. Both of these greatly increased the quality and flavor of the slices. It made them unique and memorable in a city filled with typical and unextraordinary pizza slices. Brussels and Bacon Slice (5/5): This was a delicious slice that was different from anything I have had at a sliceria before. Their Brussels sprouts were average but the bacon was exceptional. They also add a truffle oil that greatly enhanced the flavor and smell of the slice. It made it feel more refined even though it came from an unassuming slice shop! If you are looking for an option that is different but still delicious, this is a great choice. Baker's Slice (5/5): This was my favorite slice. I love White Pizza and they did this variation incredibly well. It comes with sausage and caramelized onions, two things I love. It also had plenty of ricotta, a defining feature of a great white slice. Tartufo (5/5): Much like the last slice, this was a great variation of a typical white slice. It comes with cremini mushrooms which were great. It also had the truffle oil that was on the Brussels and Bacon Slice. All of these options were great. Baker's was fast and their ingredients and flavors set them apart. This is a hidden gem in the East Village. I would come back here, even in an area filled with so many quality pizza options!.great pizza spot in the nerigborhood! super casual and fun employees and great ambiance insideboth of my pizzas had a beautiful crispy crust, great, simple toppings, and were simply delicious. perfect amount of oil and grease on them toothe pesto bites were pretty good too, i would recommend getting those as welli would def recommend this spot for any late night pizza expeditions, you won't be disappointed.Good but food was not rememberable.Dropped in to check out this highly rated spot. It's a couple of blocks from village square pizza and Tompkins square. Run by a nice guy.Ended up getting the pesto knots, an Italian sausage white slice and a meatball parm slice. The Italian sausage slice was the winner but neither slice was something I would go out of my way to get again. The pesto knots were decent but would have used more cheese..Really delicious tomato sauce and friendly staff. My favorite is the simple cheese slice."
"Pros- person who served me was very friendly- slice of pizza was very big and delicious!- service was very fastCons- pizza was a little oily..I could see small pools of oil on the pizza slice- the place could've been a little cleaner.You should have never closed down and sold out to this place that's in there now...... the pizza it's worse than those $0.99 a slice pizza places the whole pie we ordered was not even worth $0.99.... NONNAS  = YUKK.ny got chicken cutlet parm, this vegetarian thought it looked and smelled AMAZING!!!!! I got a salad... It was delicious...!!!.Always get pizza delivery from here.....Never ever been disappointed. ...Love the pizza and super fast delivery ....And nicest delivery guys in NYC. .... Kudos Fat Sals.Very rude service for a regular like me. Unacceptable..Best Cheesy Garlic bread ever. It is a MUST. Pizza looks OK..Decent slice and decent garlic knots.  While sitting eating my slice I couldn't help but notice the artwork on the wall.  It was a photo of a pizzeria from the 50's.  The sign said 15 cents for a slice.  Somehow times have changed, at roughly 20x the price.Still it hits the spot in a pinch..$5.50 for two plain slices. Tasted fine, like NY pizza should. Was open late on a Thursday. Not sure why others had such a bad experience..This is the worst pizza I've ever had not only in NYC but in my life.I ordered online and waited an hour for the pizza to arrive. When I opened the box, the pizza looked like a curled up piece of bread rather than an actual pizza. The grease was overwhelming for such a thin pizza, making my meal a greasy swarm of bread rather than an actual pizza.There are so many great pizza options here in the city; do not be a sucker and buy ""pizza"" from this place..I passed by a 99 cent pizza place and told myself no, there's no reason eat at one of those places when there's a *real* pizza joint so close. I regret not giving the 99 cent pizza a shot. Massive, doughy, limp, un-tasty slice..My super quick slice of $3 Sicilian was a smidgen too crusty (tough tasting) and the cheese had that ""just eat it it's drunk food"" allure of also being tough/dry. Despite having achieved any level of intoxication, I'm going to say this piece was kind of lacking. The line went fast and I managed to grab the 2nd to last slice of Sicilian when Sal's was literally 4 slices of pizza (of anything) away from being out. I don't doubt during waking hours the experience is a little better..Am I so wrong to think that a slice of re-heated cheese pizza should not cost over $4? The fifth location of Fat Sal's replaced the recently closed Apizza which I'd been only a desperate late-night patron of on occasion before they closed. I'd actually hoped for an improvement but instead received more of the same. The same disinterested and distracted service, same overpriced mediocre slices and same oddly chairless open space. The outside sign and ventilation system of the restaurant seem to be the only really progress they've made. Additionally, I have a strong feeling that the staff marks up the slices after 11pm once they lure in the bar crowd since according the the website whole plain pies are only $15..Food may be okay, but delivery is a disaster. They quickly delivered half my order, but the speed was probably because they didn't deliver the other half. It took two phone calls and another HOUR before the entire meal was delivered. With no apology by anyone. Never again."
"this review is for their egg tartsflaky outside, creamy and sweet egg custard on the inside. paid a little over a dollar for one of these bad boys. can't go wrong.their iced teas/coffees w milk look rather popular here. will be back to try other things! the pastries didn't seem self serve like how it is at fayda/taipan.Great place for fresh bao and lemon/milk tea. Their bao is wrapped in protective sealed practice and they are in enclosed containers instead of out in the open which I like just in case flies get inside. They are also usually well stocked and don't run out of bao and if they do they usually have another batch being made. They now have a machine that puts a seal over your drinks which is so helpful if you're getting one on the go rather than sitting down inside. It is air conditioned but quite dirty inside. However, there is a lot of seating so you don't have to worry about grabbing a chair. The menu on the wall is in large print and shows all the prices both in Chinese and English. One of my go to bakeries in Chinatown..A franchise chain with multiple Chinatown Manhattan locations.  Golden Manna Bakery carries all the staples of traditional Cantonese baked goodies.  After a immediate disappoint departure from nearby Audrey Bakery, my party of two came here.  Yes, they carry my childhood favorite-- egg custard tart 蛋 撻 (daan6 taat3/1).  My egg custard tart instantly fallen apart as I bite into it.  It did not withstand when holding up to my bite.  I requested one small hot Green tea without milk but only sugar.  My family member ordered one pineapple bun and one small coffee without milk but only sugar, as like most Asians, she is lactose intolerance.  Two pastries, two drinks totals a reasonable $3.90.  The server attributed at least four packets of sugar as my hot Green Tea was immeasurably too sweet, which I dislike!!Service is average and fluent in Cantonese.  Seating is insufficient to fulfill this heavy populated customer traffic.  Noise volume level is extremely loud, amid no background music, but the constant chatter in rapid-fire Chinese and gossip from elderly is extremely deafening loud as a restaurant level.  However, this is just a simple bakery and the noise volume from patrons' chatter is tone deafening loud on a Friday afternoon!!.OMG delicious !!! Ordered some Fresh and Hot Roast Pork Buns. Had some Ham and Egg on the Bun ! Even Better than the Roast Pork. Sweet Tasting Buns. Even ordered some Red Bean Sesame Balls to go !!! Definitely Recommend this Authentic Chinese Bakery.I always looking for those sponge cake slice things.  A lot of chinese bakeries do them but they taste like nothing.  Got the coffee one it was really good. Will be back to try some other things! (I think Manna 2 on Forsyth and ? is the same people - fyi.  Anyway yay for finding more great chinese bakeries :).I heard this was the best egg tart place in Chinatown so a friend and I decided to stop in after dim sum. Place was clean and full of old Asian people so you know their bakery is very authentic to the traditional egg tart. The egg tarts were $1.25 so a little on the pricey side but so worth it. The egg was the perfect level of sweet and the crispy crust balanced it very well. YUM!.Stopped in with my wife and tried our first Boba Tea.   Place was very clean and staff was friendly.  The cases were filled with amazing looking treats and breads.  I'll be back to try some on and empty stomach next time!.It's a Chinese bakery. What do you expect? Me, it better be full of old people. That's basically the stamp of authenticity when it comes to Chinese places. It means they're affordable, as they turn up probably 6/7 days of the week, and also good enough to frequent constantly. If you're not used to what Chinese bakeries have to offer, skip straight to their egg custard tarts. Most people think that they need to be burnt a very flaky, but if categorically speaking, that would be referred to as a ""Portuguese Egg Tart"" in Chinese. An egg custard tart should be smooth, consistent and a fair color, but not overcooked (look burnt). And for $1.25 apiece? What else could you ask for?.One of my most favorite bakeries in Chinatown. All their buns are delicious. I always get the sponge cakes, egg tarts, ham&egg and hotdog buns. Packaging of the bread is nice - has the nutrition and ingredient facts on it. Interior is clean and everything looks hygienic - whereas their counterparts in Chinatown lack..Egg Tarts are $1 each.A bit pricier than some of the other Chinese bakeries around. Their tarts are also better tasting. Fresh, light, flaky and buttery crust. The custard was a bit bland and watery. The eggy flavor isn't as noticeable but it's light, smooth and slightly sweet. They have a nice selection of baked goods. Seating is available, the bakery is quite spacious.It can get packed and disorganized at times. Most baked goods are within reach. If you're interested in a mini or regular sized cake, do your best to get someones attention. On busy days, there really isn't an organized line. Everyone stands around the cashiers and does their best to get noticed.Though their Egg Tarts are a bit pricey, their other baked goods are reasonably priced."
"newyork.grubstreet.com/2…Another realty casualty. Luckily, there are still plenty of Chinese bakeries around, but still....The baked goods are good here...I love the ham and scallion bun.  The milk tea, and ovaltine I've had here pretty much tasted like hot water...no flavor.  A scallion bun plus drink costs about $1.60...cheap and pretty yum. The stupid thing about these bakeries is there is no such thing as a line.  You will just have to somehow get the server's attention and order your shit...and if you're too slow in saying what  you want, and the customer next to you blurts it out before you, TOO BAD..they will get served instead..This is not as bustling with business than the Manna House on Mott street. I feel that the bakers here are not as skilled as the ones on Mott either. That makes it a plus because this means that each Manna House bakes (or steams, yes some baked goods are steamed,) their own from fresh. It is still worth the visit if I can't make it to the Mott street one."
"BEST CHICKEN PARM!!!!!!!!!!!!Wow, Wow!!!!  I am new to the area and have been trying many restaurants.  This has to the best.  Love the ambiance.  The cannoli are awesome.  Can't wait to go back to their Bolognese.  Definitely worth the trip!  My guest had the veal and she loved it..First time dining here.  It was just OK.  Got the breaded artichoke appetizer.  Didn't appear to be fresh artichoke, complete with the long stem (like one might get at an Italian restaurant).  Seemed more like artichoke out of a jar, smothered in bread crumbs.  Tasted good but...nothing high-end.Bread was good.  Clearly authentic, classic, fresh Italian bread.  Came with a flavored olive oil for dipping.  Tasty.Got a glass of Montepulciano.   Good.For entree, got the manicotti.  Very average.  Not delicate.  Not 'sublime' (like   a good manicotti would often be).  Almost a bit dry, so all the more reason for me to need more sauce than was provided me.Also, while most of the staff I saw there were wearing masks, at least one was not.  A bit surprising to see in a restaurant.  Typically, all staff are (currently) wearing masks..So cozy inside! The Food was amazing. Chicken parm was so tender you can cut it with a fork. The eggplant parm the best I've ever had. And we got 2 mini cannoli as a Christmas treat from the staff. Will definitely go back! Great service too.Great Italian restaurant that has legitimate Italian family heritage in the area.  The food tastes like home cooked food from mom which is I'm sure what they're going for. I highly recommend a visit.This place is been a staple for me in this neighborhood I bring anyone that wants what I qualify as a real Italian meal. No need to get all dressed up.My favorite dish is a tri-colored Tortollini bolognese. I've been coming here since 2005. The place is quaint, not so much to look at even though they recently did a little upgrade. This is a place you do not come for the view to see or to be seen or for a beautiful breathtaking view.  You come to for the food..We loved this place. The service was very pleasant.  The food was amazing. We ordered veal and eggplant and a side of broccoli. Our granddaughter ordered spaghetti with a meatball.  Everything was excellent and delicious.  The sauce especially was great! It was the perfect lunch.  Thank you Ann & Tony's!!.I was so disappointed with the quality of food.  It used to be a good restaurant but I don't know what happened.  It's like they pre-made the dishes and then threw them in the microwave because it was not fresh!  Never again..I used to frequent this place when I attended college. It is definitely not the same. I came with my family. Food was very bad. Mussels were cold and they took them back only to have them nuked in a microwave. Spaghetti carbonara was runny. The only good thing was the wine and bread. Never coming back..I'm very much satisfied with Ann & Tony's Restaurant. The value is exceptional. Very yummy and also healthy. The staff was extremely courteous and service is terrific. Can not wait to come back to Ann & Tony's Restaurant. Definitely recommending to others..We were the only diners in the restaurant, but they still seated us next to the bathrooms which I felt was beyond rude.  They have old school exposed brick walls, charming. The Chianti and the bread were excellent, the appetizers very good: stuffed artichoke hearts and clams casino.  My friend had Veal Marsala which she liked.  I ordered a dish called Shrimp Capri, however, the waiter did not apparently hear me properly and he brought me out Shrimp Scampi which was disappointing as I was looking forward to what I ordered.  I did not send it back because I didn't want to wait for the correct dish to be cooked as I would have gotten it when my friend was finished with her meal.  So I just ate the Shrimp Scampi which doesn't thrill me and was just average.  We had Tirimisu for dessert which was outstanding. No one ever refilled my water glass although one of the waiters did come over to the table to ask if we needed anything else before my water was gone.  They also came and started to remove food before I was totally finished. There were two waiters and I told one of them what happened with the Shrimp Capri so it wouldn't happen with someone else, and he rudely replied ""I'm not the one who took your order.""  He did not convey anything to the other waiter.  I would have given five stars except for the service which was not totally up to par, being seated by the bathrooms-- that really upset me, and just an average entree."
"We had the pizza delivered to our hotel. My only issue is that they wanted cash and I wasn't told prior to delivery. Outside of that, the vegan pizza was great! Lots of great veggies. The crust was thick and crisp- different but very good!.Tiny shop, no tables. Our slice,Tasteless thin crust. Tasteless thin pepperoni. Tasteless shredded sausage (who does that?!).Tasteless cheese. ...all for $4.57!  No thank you!.Working in the office so I thought a treat for me and my coworker. Ordered a medium pie with sausage on one half and anchovies on the other. Got? A large pie with Sausage and spinach on one side and extra cheese on the other. Ordered a Diet Coke and got a Pepsi. Emailed to let them know? No reply. Easy to reach when you're ordering but not there once they have your cash. If you order? Make sure you get a small cheese cuz they'll send a large with a whole lotta crap that was not asked.Go elsewhere. You'll thank me later..Not good at all. The only reason I am giving two stars is because someone needs to come save these guys working here. The owner has zero prices listed and the workers are getting yelled at for this. Not to mention the whole time you are in there it's basically a chance to get asked multiple times for spare change or if you want some weed. The pizza is meh at best..Do not judge a book by its cover!My family and I were looking to try out vegan NYC style pizzas and we found Kiss My Slice. I got the vegan margarita pizza (unfortunately they only had that option) and my family tried the vegetarian ones. Though my family was very skeptical about trying this place, they changed their mind as soon as they tasted the pizza. They claim that this was one of the best pizzas they've ever had! I liked my margarita pizza too - they use Numu cheese (so dang good!) And the crust was so light and delicious. I definitely recommend this place for all fellow vegans. I hope to visit them again to try their vegan option with Beyond meat..Came back today, wife was craving pesto pizza, asked if they had pesto...employee looked around and said we're out...What pizza establishment doesn't have pesto???Disappointing....!!!.Really good  ""thin"" crust pizza. Wifey and I had a few slices in the area and this place in our opinion is the best, hands down. Good, fast service..This place was right down the street from my hotel. Cool place everyone's very friendly. The food is a 4 star. Solid. Giving it 5 because the sweet lady that checked me out and the friendly cooks. Are here twice and didn't regret it..Going back to hotel after a show and hadn't had any pizza yet. They had a special for two slices and a drink for 5.50. Expectations weren't too high, but I have to say they were exceeded. Pizza was warmed to perfection. It had a great taste and still had a crispness to the crust. Service was also amazing..We got a slice of pizza every single night while in NYC because... you've got to! There's nothing like ending a cold day of adventuring through the concrete jungle than with a slice of piping-hot pizza in your hotel room.This spot is located on a busy corner, just steps from the main drag near Times Square. It was the pizza place with the highest reviews in the area, so we stopped in. It's a small store and was crammed with people, but we quickly ordered and took our 'za to go. You have to be ready to order quickly because the line moves fast and it's full of tourists. The pizza itself is delicious, NY, thin-style and comes by the slcie. Enjoy!.What can I say....another NY pizza shop which to me personally is on the same level flavor-wise as dominos or Pizza Hut. Still don't get the hype over NY pizza. That being said the prices we're a little more reasonable than other stops like Joe's at about $26 for a whole specialty pie vs $33 at Joe's. Still not great (or reasonable) in my mind but much easier to swallow. They also do a nice deal where you can get two cheese slices and a can of soda for $5.50.I still give it four stars because the staff is super friendly and helpful and was nice enough to pack up utensils, napkins, and plates without me even asking. If you want to try out what NY pizza is about this was a better deal in my opinion."
"We had the pizza delivered to our hotel. My only issue is that they wanted cash and I wasn't told prior to delivery. Outside of that, the vegan pizza was great! Lots of great veggies.

"I ordered from Doordash and the picture looks nothing like the food that was delivered. No fruits, no whipped cream, no fluffy pancakes. Pancakes are burnt and disgusting. This is the worst breakfast I ever had. I don't know why this store is still open. Horrible. I should've checked yelp first before ordering. *Eye roll*.The worst. I ordered and then after 90 minutes they just cancelled my order without explanation. Horrible service. Don't order from here."

"I love this so place so much I am posting this twice The hummus and falafel is amazing.Perfect place for a hungry vegetarian.If you are a hungry vegetarian and looking for good food, look no further and come here. I have a big appetite and I love coming here because the servings are decent in the food is delicious in fresh. I love their falafel and hummus. It's all delicious!!.***5 STAR RESTAURANT***I come here on a regular basis and I just love the Sabich Sandwich it melts in your mouth and the customer service is very professional thanks to the manager Naemah This is the place you want to check out if your visiting New York City. Thank me later.A good casual place for Mediterranean. It has lots of pitas. Nish Nush has a couple locations with this one being in FiDi. Has a very casual atmosphere. The prices are typically kind of high but nothing that seems out of the ordinary for around here. It has the classic stuff here such as falafel. Just being clear, they actually have three different flavors of falafel. They have the Classic, which is the regular kind everyone knows whoever has been to a Mediterranean restaurant. It also has the Roasted Red Pepper. The final one is the Spinach And Mushroom, which sounds weird. But I'm curious. Maybe soon I will get this. I picked up a Classic Forever. It's $8, kind of a lot for only a sandwich. This comes with Classic flavored falafel, hummus, Israeli salad, and tahini. Has lots of good things and they give you a lot. It makes up for the kind of high prices. There's also a location in Tribeca..Ordered a falafel Trio platter.It was some of the best falafel I've ever had.  Even better than one of the cart's in zucotti park.Falafel Trioall three falafel flavors, hummus, Israeli salad, white & red cabbage, romaine lettuce, olives, pickles, tahini & schugIt came with a generous sized salad, and really good pita.I had wanted to try the flavored falafel, so the platter was the best way.  I thought the chili falafel was the best of the three.I hadn't been over this way before, but I will go back again for sure, with out without the 15% off they kept texting my phone with, lol..Really good food! Their hummus is better than the regular store-bought ones - noticeably creamier and smoother. The pita bread is the thick and fluffy kind, which is what I prefer. Out of the trio, I think the red falafel has the best flavor..What a find in FiDi! I don't know if they have one of these in California but if there is one, you need to try this out. Daughter and I shared the falafel trio which came with a huge pita, three different salads, hummus, pickles, tahini and a green spicy sauce (don't know the name) for $14.  Also got a side of the cauliflower for $6.Loved trying out the different falafels - one was particularly spicy. The salads were fresh and consisted of a purple cabbage, a tomato/cucumber mix and a type of coleslaw. The deep fried cauliflower came topped with drizzled tahini and lightly spiced. So delicious! We unfortunately couldn't finish it but as I'm sitting in JFK now, would pay anything to have this again. What a find! Highly recommend..Stopped here to pick up lunch to go on a Sunday afternoon. Pretty empty and the food came out quick. Has a nice ambiance for those who wish to dine in! I got the falafel trio platter which was delicious and cauliflower on the side. The chili one was very spicy! Loved everything and will definitely be back to try more items. Unfortunately the container wasn't closed properly so there was some spilling and my bag got ruined, hopefully it was just a faulty container and not a regular thing..Delicious middle eastern food with many vegan options. Some of the best whole wheat pita over ever had! Fresh, warm, fluffy, soft interior, crisp exterior. Very flavorful food! The shawarma platter was the big star. I also loved the green bell pepper dressing that came with the hummus was silky smooth. Kale salad was too filling!.Used the Too Goo To Go app for the first time here. $5 per meal for 5 falafel each, tub of hummus each, a salad each, pita each and sauces. Great value! I've been to Nish Nush a few times and the food is always great..Always been a regular at the Reade St's. First time visiting the one here, superb! Same awesome top notch flavors. Never get to disappoint my tounge and mood. Love every inch of it."
"I ordered using UberEats. After my order came missing items I left my house and went to the restaurant to give them an opportunity to correct the order prior to reporting back to Uber eats. The female in the restaurant let me know that she was more concerned about the chance that we would receive a refund from uber eats, than righting their wrong and providing us with the food we paid for. Terrible customer service, it was clear she has no business at the front of anyone's restaurant. As for the food, the Rasta pasta was fine, yams were nice and sweet but slightly tough, Asian wings were good. The salt fish fritter was large and good. The salmon, string beans, and mashed potatoes were tasty. The grilled shrimp had nice flavor. Unfortunately, all of my food was cold so I needed to zap it in the microwave before I could eat it.Customer service is everything to me, so this feels like a 1 star restaurant, still since some of the food tasted good I give this restaurant 2 stars and hope they invest in customer service training for the people that are posted in the front of their restaurant..Disgusting Service! The food doesn't even taste good enough to even have so much pride working there. One specific short bleach out female that works in there that just needs to be fired ALREADY!.I try to support local businesses. But some of these places just need to disappear. Waited over an hour for the $40 Surf and Turf which was supposed to be steak, shrimp, lobster and pasta only to receive no shrimp. Honestly, I advised my boyfriend that Uber Surf and Turf from Flava II would most likely disappoint,but he chose not to heed my warnings. Being the positive person that I am, I DID remind him that 2 out of 3 ain't bad. Eat the overdone steak, poorly seasoned lobster and bland pasta and be happy you could afford to waste money on this travesty of a meal. Next time I choose the restaurant.Food don't taste the same anymore. My fried chicken taste like it was cooked in oil that was already used for frying fish. You order something and the waiters never give you what you ask for. They are rude and nasty..Food was good but I ordered a Large Curry Goat with a side of Macaroni Pie & Plantains. But received a Large order of Macaroni Pie with a side of Curry Goat which was mostly big bones mixed in curry sauce..Don't waste ur time the drinks are no good the food ok and their service sucks ( the servers be on their phone) b4 they attend to the customers.This place needs a health inspection. The food here smelled and tasted like it had been sitting out. This place needs a new everything starting with the staff.I am here now. Service is terrible. Ordering a drink? You got to wait at least 45 minutes. Ordering bottle service? Sure we'll serve you before everyone else, even if you just got here. Priority! There is 1-3 waiters here that try their best to make sure you are taken care of but, they are taking orders from a different section. Great music and atmosphere but the service is terrible. We sat their for 45 minutes for one drink. What is the point?? We didn't even order food...our first time and our last!.I bought coconut water from this place yesterday. It was acidic. Obviously spoiled or previously opened. I tried to call this restaurant to simply alert them and try to get a new one and the number does not even work..I went there after a long morning, my man and I chose the oxtail rice n peas cabbage N plantain...Cow foot soup n we tried their beef patty...Well Well Well opened the container was soiled The ride n peas was sour sour sour...  the entire container in the garbage Nasty Nasty food. A waste of money no thanks every again"
"With Cafe R and the hotel having a deal for us to get free breakfast was a great idea we thought we should try out their 10.99$ buffet deal. Their breakfast deal with Hotel Pennsylvania was very grim and didn't have a whole lot of options but that's what you get for free. With the complimentary breakfast it included fresh fruit, your choice of either bread, or types of danishes and or muffins, choice of juice or coffee. The highlight of the meal was the muffins. The muffins was were always so moist and flakey. The fruit didn't always taste fresh and were really soggy by the time you got to them. The reason behind the 3 stars is their buffet. We wanted to eat cheaper on our last night in NYC and we decided to eat here. Huge issue here with the buffet is that nothing is named, no hot lamps and all the food were almost as cold as the outside temperature. The chicken tenders were the only thing worth eating even though it was cold. I highly recommend coming early when they first put it out so you're not getting older colder food..They sell overpriced buffet food that's been left out for hours. I got a stomach ache and abnormally bloated after eating a freshly overcooked steak (the cook was multitasking and left it cooking for longer) and vegetables that were slimy, mushy and not fresh. I went right back to tell the owner or manager and he said he was going to check with another manager and told me to come back tomorrow. Bad customer service. The staff aren't approachable or nice. I was waiting to place my order and the cook washing pots and pans in the back got upset when I politely asked if the kitchen was open and who I could place an order with (it was still open and not around closing time.) He said it was obvious that he was busy and then begrudgingly prepared my order. Every time I've come here, they've been understaffed (bad management.) There weren't nearly as many food options as there used to be because of the pandemic. On multiple occasions, the bathrooms weren't clean and barely had any water to wash your hands or to flush the toilets (I've unfortunately seen piles of disgusting things inside of them.) It seems this business is getting worse over the years. I wish the food tasted as good as it looks in the picture that I took of it. I'll add it to this review..Went here because we had a food coupon we didn't want to waste. Went around 11 in the morning so their breakfast counter was shut. The place is okay with a buffet area and made to order counters that are open at different times. They seem to have little bit of every cuisine. The food counters are okay price wise but the buffet and on the go items are a total rip off ($3 for a cup of yogurt? , no thank you!). Ordered the scrambled eggs with toast, instead got an omelette (too lazy to scramble 'em eggs bro?). The buffet items were heated with steam from the bottom so basically they were barely warm. Some tables weren't clean and the floor definitely needed some cleaning. I'd say breakfast is the only worthwhile time to go here. Avoid otherwise..I am a little disappointed that the wait staff in this restaurant lack customer service. I wanted to order food, but was never waited on. I asked one staff member if they served sushi and he rudely responded NO. Maybe I caught them on the wrong day or at a bad time..As you guys are aware majority of places are closed to COVID-19 but the R cafe isn't but I'm writing this review for the lack of humanity displayed by the owner of this establishment. I'm currently 6 months pregnant and I needed to use the bathroom badly( which I explained to the owner) and he said No! I couldn't. My condition is uncontrollable but your action were. I was so disappointed that I almost cried. Just wow. Unbelievable.Went here fo continental breakfast and this place is a glorified highschool cafeteria. The food is like a ""greatest hits"" compilation of everything you can grab and go in the frozen foods aisle of your food store. They have 200 bagels on the line EVERY ONE OF THEM PRE MADE WITH CREAM CHEESE.....Why would you pre-make every bagel with the same spread? Even if you don't offer any other spread at least give people the option to take the bagel plain.You proceed to ask this question to the person working the line and they look at you like you have 12 heads growing out of your shoulders...... There's a Starbucks 35 yards down the road and 50 real delis that have people who can engage with you working there. I bet they even make bagels without smear already lathered on them..Excellent, clean place. Large multiple areas for seating. Entered on West 31 Street, but I think you also have an entrance on W.32strert. Huge space, nicely done. Freshly made at lunch time 12:45pm. Enjoyed an under $4!!!! Fabulous & so delicious lunch/snack. Wanted to just try a little to decide if things were as good as they looked, and yesssss, they are!I had the freshly made, lightly egg battered, White Fish, & a bit of lobster with melted cheese. Both really good. Where on earth can you get this for $.Nicely made food items. Lovely looking fresh fruit salads, too bad a woman was tasting it!! NO TASTING!! Minus ONE STAR because, I feel they should have a self serve water put her, or huge covered water container with a spout, like Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken has--it's even filtered water at Blue Ribbon.I asked for a cup for water, figuring they'd at least have self-serve pitchers, but she said to ask the Juice Bar station....so I walked the 1/4 mile lol, place is huge & nice, juice bar pointed to their sink behind counter. I said never mind. I got the feeling he would have let me go behind counter & use sink to fill my styrofoam cup. Just a feeling.So MY SUGGESTION is to have a self serve COLD Water area. Good eats are here. So I actually ate here for under $4, which is also under $5!  Lol.Great cafe located in a busy section of Chelsea. This is one of those giant deli/cafe places that has a bunch of different sections of hot food, grab and go, fresh made sandwiches and salads and what not. I've only been in for MealPal and haven't had a bad experience. When I went, there was a jazz band playing? Cool ambiance, nice touch as I was trying to find the back of the cafe where MealPal was. The sandwiches here are pretty good, definitely feel standard but portion is very good and you get some chips as well. The wait on line, even during the busiest times are easy to get through. Solid place, would recommend for a lunch on the go or a nice open place to sit in the middle of shopping or sight seeing..One of my colleagues Brad B. mentioned about Cafe R and I just had it bookmarked for a week or so. I came here for my lunch hour. Its so convenient on the same block as Jack's. Woah baby what a spacious food court with stations on both sides of different varieties of food from Pizza, Burgers, Chinese, Mexican, Sushi, and so many more of which I took a quick glance. I went for the Hot & Cold Buffet and I remember to take a plastic container than styrofoam. Definitely a lot of more choices for the Hot Buffet than I have seen at as the cashier agrees with me as it was her 4th day hehe. I showed her my Yelp check-in 10% off for Cooked Food but wouldn't it be everything since they have to cook the raw ingredients...am I right? lol There's more seating upstairs as well some tables by the cashwrap area. I noticed a live band going to perform as I was leaving Cafe R. If you are around the neighborhood and starving, come here since its open 24/7!.Terrible service.  This is where I could have used my complementary voucher for breakfast from the Pennsylvania Hotel.  The girl who was standing at the line to guide the hotel guests were very rude.  She had a nasty, stinky attitude.  She clearly was, young, damn, and ignorant?  Or perhaps gotten up on the wrong side of the bed.  Nevertheless, she had no idea what the customer service was all about.  I didn't say anything because I didn't want to start out my day with an unpleasant event but she was a total bitch.  Not just that either you can have juice or hot beverages not both, what a cheap scape."
"PERFECTI know everyone and their brother has ""the"" pizza place you gotta go in NYC.  Whatever, this place is fucking perfect, thin, delicious crispy crust and toppings.  We always get a new flavors between the four of us and I always wish I just got the plain cheese.  It's just perfect pizza.If you're in manhattan looking for a great slice on the go, this is a guaranteed win..If you are looking for authentic New York style pizza this is it. Sure some might complain that it's been too commercialized and it's not cool anymore. I don't care what they say. The reason this place always has a line is because it's good and simple. You can't visit NY and not have this great pizza.There are no tables to sit on. Like most places in NY you have to eat standing up or on the go. There may be a huge line but it moves quickly..Great tasting pizza. Visited here two times in two weekends and they kept up with their amazing taste. Can't wait to come back and enjoy a few slices of their pizza. The crust was a little burnt, but still fantastic!.I saw Bobby Flay post about this location and make a recommendation.. So when I realized they opened a location in the Broadway/Times Square area I was so excited! This is the perfect place for a classic, thin crust, greasy, cheesy New York slice. I went on a Wednesday evening after I got out of an 8 PM show and there was a line out the door. It still moved fairly quickly. I got a plain slice for $4, so good. Exactly what I expected. There were plenty of people though that came out with whole pies! The place is pretty small, only a few small high top tables and counter areas to stand at but it's perfect for grab and go. And they're open late! While this location isn't on the main road, not near the bright lights of Times Square and the Broadway theaters, it is not far at all. I would recommend passing the other knock-off type chains and visiting this established location for an authentic slice..We went on recommendation to this place. There are many neat photos of celebrities eating Joe's pizza on the walls. Looks like they were taken at a different Joe's location. I had a slice of pepperoni. The sauce was bland compared to other pizza we have had on this trip. The margarita pizza, the tomatoes and mozzarella were still somewhat cold. The serving model is order your slices, they toss them in the oven to warm and hand them back when you pay. So they are in the oven for 1-2 minutes. Not enough time to heat back through. It was ok..wowowowowow. my first slice of new york pizza was at Joe's and I'm STILL blown away. I ordered a cheese ""plain"" pizza (just one) for dinner. I came on a Thursday night around 6pm. It was a gloomy/foggy day so I was expecting a short line - but the line was out the door and spilling into the sidewalk as usual. Don't let the line fool you, it moves quick! My cheese pizza was $3.75 and it was a big slice! They heat up the pizza perfectly and my crust was not burned at all. The pizza itself is salty, fragrant, crispy, hot, and just plain delicious. Worth every penny and worth the wait in line. Highly highly recommend that everyone comes to Joes. They have condiments (cheese, red pepper flakes, pepper, oregano) on the tables. Payments under $5 must be made in cash - but they accept credit card for orders over $5. Workers here are pretty friendly. There's no seats really, but plenty of space to stand around and eat!.Honestly the best pizza I've ever had. The line is always long, which shows how great it is. Delicious. Quick service. Good price. What else can you ask for???.It's a little tough to find great pizza in southeast Virginia. A lot of places talk about having NY style, but they have no idea what they're song with the ingredients. So when in Manhattan, we got our much needed pizza fix. And Joe's is about the best place to get it. Perfect large slice. Thin, crispy and chewy crust, good quality sauce and cheese, fresh toppings. And the staff is awesome. They have such a small space, but they are so fast and organized with taking the order and slamming those slices in the oven. 27 bucks for 4 slices and 2 bottles drinks isn't cheap, but hey, welcome to Times Square!.Typical but very good NY pizza. Always a favorite quick bite while walking around Times Square. Line is always long but worth the wait. I recommend getting a whole pie if more than 2 people because a whole pie somehow looks and tastes better than a slice...  yes, therés a hint of implication there that it's by design(?)!!!!.When in New York, ya gotta have New York-style pizza, so I heard Joe's Pizza was a good spot for it.  And it certainly was.  It's the kind of pizza slice that's reliable, affordable and solid, so I can see why people are fans. We visited Joe's Pizza on a Sunday night, and the place had a short line; but it went by swiftly.  Although the shop itself is on the smaller side, many people were getting takeout, and there was also a heated, covered outdoor dining area that many people were eating their slice at, so we didn't have an issue finding a countertop to eat at.  I saw many takeout orders of whole pies going out.  It was a popular spot, especially since it's located in Times Square.I ordered a slice of the supreme pizza, which the staff warmed up.  It was a good slice of pizza, with sausage, pepperoni, mushroom and red onions.  Not much to this pizza; but I say, simple, classic pizzas hardly ever get it wrong.  Was it the best pizza I've ever had?  Well, no.  But it was good - and it was floppy enough for me to fold, which gives it the signature NY-style pizza flair.  I dig it."
"Been wanting to stop in here for quite a while. What I had:- A cup of soup, great balance of flavor. Really enjoyed it, they included with crackers on side. - chicken souvlaki plate, a solid choice if you want a bit of everything: salad, meat, potato side, dolma, and some olives. - Spankopita spinach pie was pretty fresh and delightful. Flakey and really hit the spot. Service was a little lacking. We sat before another party - ready to order but they took their order and brought them water first, thought that was odd. I'd come back again for the food..Updated review as I come here several times a month. With the COVID-19 mandate in affect for indoor dining on NYC it was good to see they were checking vaccine cards and enforcing the mandate.They are very  bud for take out, indoor was slower this week than past and the service is always good. The food is consistently good, prices have not really changed unlike Nature's Grill about 2 blocks away who raised prices by at least 30-40% over the last 2-3 years. The portions at Something Greek at sizable and the quality and freshness is tops. They have some of the best burgers which is a surprise. Not just great chicken and lamb. There is a nice outside garden and all around one of the best values for food, service, and dining in Bay Ridge.I highly recommend them if you have not tried them..Shout out to Something Greek, their staff and owners. All through the COVID-19 pandemic they were open for delivery and take out as they established a loyal following of customers and most likely have a new following. Even though I reviewed the restaurant in the past they deserve this as they have only got better. For the past few years before COVID I found myself eating out here 2 or 3 times a month.  Always consistent, the food is high quality, fresh, the cooks take pride in their job, and the place is always clean.As we start to come out of the pandemic and they opened for indoor dining I can see even more attention taken by the staff to constantly cleaning the restaurant. All of the staff are wearing their masks properly. Not once did I ever walk in where an employee had it down below their noses like other restaurants. They have plexiglass up at the counter, are taking precautions for indoor dining, and constantly disinfect the restaurant from front to back. What I like most is that Something Greek  has kept their pricing the same!! That's great as many of their customers were either out of work, did not receive raises, or had more expenses like child care. I was so upset when I saw the menu for another restaurant 2 blocks away called ""Natures Grill"" that raised their prices 20% without saying a word to anyone. They also added online order charges for pick up or take out.  I checked my receipts from 2018 and calculated that ""Natures Grill"" raised their prices about 60% in the last 3 years.Hats off to Something Greek and other restaurants that consider their customers more than profits. Please try Something Greek! You won't be disappointed!! Great salads, sandwiches, soups, burgers, gyro platters, entrees and deserts. I highly recommend them..Haven't dined in for a while here, just been doing take out, every one to two weeks. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic the entire staff has been there for the customers, not skipped a beat and kept the food and service to the highest standard.I wanted to acknowledge how well they are doing. When I stopped in today I observed one of the workers wiping down and disinfecting everything from the front door handles, to the plexiglass, tables, walls, etc.They really show care and they have been doing this all the years I've been coming here.  Indoor seating is back with limited seating indoor and outside in their back yard. I highly recommend them as their food and service is always excellent..Hit or miss, sometimes a good meal and experience, sometimes not. It's that sort of thing that'll stop a regular from coming back when it happens too often.Liked this place a lot for a year or so, but even pre-covid things were starting to getting sloppy. From randomly uncooked chunks of chicken souvlaki to missing items in takeout orders, or rude service when dining in... you never knew what you'd get. Total grab bag.The food was generally good, but then other times... it was just bad. Dry rice, stale greasy gyro meat, dried out grape leaves, separated and rancid smelling tzaziki. I'm not sure what to say, honestly.One tip if you go, DON'T order the chicken gyro, it's absolutely awful. Old dried out scraps of shredded chicken that are entirely inedible..Definitely one of my favorite fast casual Greek food places in Bay Ridge! I found their Bay Ridge location after visiting their sister location, Kuzina in Staten Island. After falling in love with the food at Kuzina, I knew I had to pay their Brooklyn location a visit. They have an extensive menu of different options to choose from. From sandwiches, to salads, to platters, and sides, there's no way you wouldn't find something you'd like! They offer lunch specials if you come on weekdays. They also have different dinner specials available throughout the week so be sure to call to see what's cooking!My favorite things to order are their dinner special salmon platter, spinach pies, hummus spreads, their chicken souvlaki pita sandwiches, and their grilled chicken breast over Greek salad (w/ extra dolmades). They are very generous with their servings. You can also change the sides and upgrade for an extra charge if you do not want want the classic rice or french fries that come with your platter. Just be sure to let the servers know and they'll be happy to substitute or help you customize your meal to your needs. Their staff is super friendly, kind, and knowledgeable about their menu. The cooks work very hard and so do the other employees. The employees treat the customers like family. I've never had a bad experience with them here or at their other locations throughout the many times I've ordered with them. Great service, amazing food; a worthy spot to check out!.The location in Dyker Heights is more for take out but service was quick and friendly and food was fresh and flavorful!  Definitely a good addition to the neighborhood!.It's a great experience. The ambiance is very welcoming and charming. Amazing wine, food and service. Staff are extremely knowledgeable and make great recommendations.The best chicken lemon I ve ever had. Worth to try!.One of my favorite Greek places in bayridge. Their shrimp souvlaki platter with lemon potatoes is something I could eat every day..Never order takeout from this restaurant. They always deliver your food very late. When you call, they lie and tell you the order is on the way but that's not true. I'll never order from here ever again. An order should take almost two hours to be delivered when you live less than 4 blocks away. Ridiculous..Delicious food and cute atmosphere, great for take out too. Love the outdoor garden in warmer weather..Love this little gem in Bay Ridge. Consistently good food and charming decor. Great value for the fresh quality. Cute outside eating area when it's nice outside..We have ordered here countless times, and every single time that we order from this place, they leave something out. Even though they have been reminded numerous times over the phone not to forget certain items, they leave them out to the point where it looks like they are doing it on purpose, and then don't answer the phone when you try to call back to get it. If you can order from somewhere else, .....do it."
"Carvel, how sweet it is, for a milkshake , or an ice cream cake, but it's my stop for me, in this wonderful heat wave, to cool down the 101 degrees inside of me.As you sit in this nice frozen area, it just hold you down to enjoy every lick you give to your cone.So how many licks do it take to get to the end, the world  will never know. LoL..Like store to hang and kick back with friend and enjoy some ice-cream abs best time to pass are on Tuesday , buy one get one free.Best time to stop by, Tuesday  night  buy one get one free ice-cream cups.If the store is open until 10pm and I'm standing inside at 9:52 and wait in line for 5 minutes. I want whatever I'm about to order when I get to the front of the line.  A young female employee said that she's not making any milkshakes because she's about to close. 1 star for being lazy and horrible customer service..I wish I could give even lower rating. Will contact health department. My wife bought my 2 year 5 month old daughter strawberry soft serve ice cream and after she had about half tried it. The icecream tasted bad so my wife threw it out and went and told the employee. The manager tasted it and said it's not bad. Well no more than a few hours later, not having eaten anything else my daughter was vomiting non stop. She still has not recovered on her 3rd day after having been to doctor that confirmed the icecream was the culprit.  If you leave your milk out of the fridge don't use it so you don't lose money. Makes me want to go grab everyone of them and make them eat their product. Stay away if I don't put them out of business..Seriously should contact health department. Employees wear no gloves, they speak over people's shakes and the toppings on display, the cones and products people consume are handled WITHOUT  gloves, it's absolutely horrifying ...it was a totally unsanitary situation. Will never come back here again. Beyond disgusting..6.50 for a small shake. And then the guy says whipped cream is 50 cents extra. I've never been charged for whipped cream. Rude owner. Crap quality ice cream. Baskin Robbins is cheaper. Better yet, go to the diner around the corner for a  cheaper and better shake..Would love to rate this place higher but they make it too easy to rate it bad. The ice cream is definitely a five star rating, it's just the service you receive. When you walk in be prepared to wait, and wait, and wait. If no one is at the counter it will take forever to get service. The whole place could be robbed of all ice cream before they noticed. They make you feel as if you're troubling them with your order and I'm yet to see anyone ever smile. Lighten up folks!! How hard is it to sell something most people love?.I absolutely love this Carvel! The service is great especially the service I received from the girls behind the counter. The ice cream is served with a smile and the shop is always clean..If I could give 0 stars I would. I ordered a cake for my daughters 3rd Birthday via email with a picture I wanted on the cake as well as what I wanted the cake to read. I sent my husband in to pay for the cake which cost about $65. While there he called me to speak to the employee to discuss the color trim I wanted as well as the color I wanted the writing to be. I asked if the picture would cover the whole cake and I was told no that there would be plenty of room for the writing I requested. On 8/20 I go to pick up the cake and there in absolutely no writing. Instead there is a happy birthday sign stuck into the cake. I spoke to Etta and explained that I was unhappy with the cake and it wasn't what I ordered. I was told I would get a call from the owners by that Friday. On 8/26 still no call from the owners, I decided to call and again spoke to Etta who basically told me she can give me $3 off another cake order and the owners stated the email was followed. Terrible customer service is all I can say. Very disappointed!.This carvel has horrible customer service. My daughter and I went there and ordered ice cream in a cup with marshmallows. The lady serving us was putting in marshmallow sauce. My daughter asked what was that and the lady was very nasty and replied ""this is ridiculous."" I explained to her that my daughter was looking for the actual marshmallows. I asked for the manager and she came out. I explained to her how unprofessional the server was. She listened and said it was a misunderstanding while me daughter cried about the commotion.The manager did giver her free ice cream but the original service was horrible. Not a kid friendly environment! If I could rate this establishment a zero I would..Don't bother going to this place for ice cream cake. They charge $10.00 more than the regular price. Thieves!!!!"
"They have renovated the place. The Menu board is now electronic. You can pay with credit/debit cards and Apple/Andriod pay. The layout has been changed as well. Even the food items are more. I like the jerk chicken. I would recommend the shrimps. The patties are always spot on. New staff and they are all amazing, two have been there for a long time. The bbq chicken is so yummy. Also, they have more side dishes now..Great place to eat. I love the curry goat (my most favorite). Fhabian is a great person... always respectful and serves you want you've requested. There is pretty lady that works there, although I don't know her name, but she is amazing. You have to try the beef patties. The next time I go there, I plan on getting the fish stew..It's been over a year since I've been here, because of a person whom use to work there... however, now that he is no longer working there, the portions are back to what it use to be. The tall guy (his name is Fhabian, I think I spelled it correctly) is great. He serves you with respect and give the customer what the ask for. He is also very friendly and nice. He interacts with everyone, while at the same time understanding that everyone is on a timed schedule. As for the food, everything is back to what it was, great... oh and the curry goat is just so damn good. I like that they put some potatoes in it. Also, the jerked chicken is spicy good. I hope to try their rotti one day. And by the way, if they could make more sides, that would be awesome. Just some requests.But the service is wonderful, I would recommend this place to everyone. I rather eat here than most places around this neighborhood. It's clean and fresh. The oxtails are good too. Here are favorites: jerked chicken, curry goat, oxtail.... I'll trying the beef patties soon, and I'll update this review once I have the beef patties. Exceptional customer service to Fhabian (the tall guy in the front)!The new lady in the front is so sweet!!!! Kudos to her..I'll be straight forward: whomever cooks the food now, puts too much salt. I ordered curry goat, and the salt was so much, my tongue was numb. The rice and peas is always dry, hence the reason why I ask for too much gravy, but they are stingy with the gravy. Especially that guy in the front, the shorter one. Same person whom acts like that place is a dating spot. People would be in line and he is flirting, I know, you're a guy, but people are in line waiting to make an order. Some of us are on lunch break, and time is running. The taller guy is very respectful and nice, if I was rating this and writing this review only based on the tall guy, then I would have given it 4 stars. The parties are like paste... No chunks of meat. Also when you ask for jerk sauce it's like the end of the world.... They don't give you anything. The short guy needs to realize it's a work place, don't profile your customers and give the customer want they ask for. The owner is nice too. That short guy is so not good. Also they should bring back the previous cook, because these foods are too salty nowadays or the cabbages are undercooked..The place is big and clean, the food is superb..Great.This place is very clean and the food is cooked to perfection. It's so good that the food finishes really quick. Sometimes I need to call an hour prior to my arrival to pickup. I love the curry goat, so good and customer service is astounding. I will recommend this place to everyone!!!.Man I had a large chicken soup today and got 4 damn potatoes, 3 pieces of chicken carcasses and 2 small dumplings. It's my fault I keep going to this damn place for some soup. One thing I did realize though is if you not Jamaican or don't have a vagina you not getting shit. Like the lady below said the cashier keeps flirting around and when he sees a dude his smile turns into a frown. No more, today was the last day. Avoid this place people, except the ladies...y'all can get whatever you desire in this place. Please take advantage..This location is awful! I was overcharged for a small Jerk Chicken and mac and cheese. I barely got jerk chicken, it was ALL bones. The cashier kept flirting with the girl in front of me, you can tell she was uncomfortable. She even tried to tell the guy to take my order to divert his attention, luckily my husband popped up on me before this guy can even start his I'll attempt at flirting. Golden Krust should really train their staff on harassment and work place etiquette before they get sued..I haven't lived in the Caribbean in a few years, but having a place that sells Tropical Rhythms and Bigga, near work, fills me with nostalgia..This place is dirty filthy with two old fan dirty the food is not all that and it's pricey.ATTITUDE, ATTITUDE, is the only thing you get at this place.  The food is horrible. Rice is dry and hard, like it has barely been cooked. The chicken patties made me sick on two occasions. I don't know what is the difference between this location's ingredients and that of the Original  Golden Krust on Gun Hill Road.  Only those who don't know real Jamaican food go to Golden Krust..Golden Krust makes decent Jamaican Beef Patties.  My favorite from them is their spicy patty, which although it isn't too hot, it has decent flavor. They also have more exotic filings (ox tail), but I'm not that adventurous to try those.If you want to try Golden Krust, but don't want to travel to the Bronx, try their stand in the Lower Level of Grand Central Terminal, right next to track 105."
"If you're having a party and need a crowd pleasing food, look no further! This is your spot! This is the ultimate comfort food that will satisfy everyone! From the tastiest bbq wings to the cheesiest mac and cheese to the most delicious collard greens, I couldn't recommend Cea-Lo enough! This wasn't my first time catering from here and it won't be my last! Thank you so much for always coming through with the easiest ordering, most delicious food and look forward to the next time!.Food was delicious! Mac and cheese was just right . I ordered fried chicken it was tasty but fried too hard. I also ordered the banana pudding ... you can tell it was sitting in the fridge for some time as the bananas inside  were too dark. My son enjoyed the cornbread though..Terrible customer service. I literally waited 40 minutes for a fried catfish dinner, and the lady at the desk literally ignored me when I asked how much longer. This is a joke! Food is usually good, but certainly not worth the experience when there are tons of new restaurants options. I highly recommend trying another option, unless service doesn't not matter to you. simple interpersonal skills should be mandated to be the face of the operation, also if you don't like your job quit..Called to place an order and terrible customer service ! Rude , wanted to support a black owned business while on vacation and received nothing but attitude ! Barely options unless they didn't want to make it . Also the gentle men was very aggressive and rude over the phone ! They literally lost business my family and I were about to spend at least 200 to 300 dollars on food !  Drove to Harlem instead ! Don't bother calling if you want food you are probably better off going in they may less attitude in front of your face.The food at cea-lo is pretty decent. The hype this restaurant get is definitely overrated. They're good but they're not great..The food is great! I normally get their fried shrimp, mac and cheese, and candy yams. I even had some dishes catered from them for my baby shower a few years back..OMG, Cea-Lo Cafe was simply excellent. The location is unbeatable. Every thing that I have tried has been really delicious. All of the staff are incredibly polite - you truly feel welcome and looked after. Amazing! Will return and recommend this spot always..Not even a star but I did eat some of it. I order family seafood combo 3 PCs whiting and 8 PCs shrimp fried with two sides Mac and cheese and rice and beans. The Mac was wack and the rice and beans made with tomatoe sauce was horrible. The fist and shrimp so bland no seasoning. Never again..Waste of Money the server was rude the Grilled shrimps were tiny an Salty!!!!!!!!The Mac salad was nothing but mayo and noodlesAnd tasted OLD and the Crab cake was so old it smelled terrible....Wasted 30 dollars and threw away the food..Cea-Lo Cafe is a fantastic spot for Comfort Food and Soul Food. It's soooo hard to find a place that has authentic Soul Food nowadays, that isn't soaked in grease and salted to Hell. Cea-Lo's is in its on league.Cea-Lo Cafe was introduced to me by my parents. They were driving by one day and decided to give it a shot. I'm so glad they did because Cea-Lo's dinner specials will leave you feeling like Thanksgiving came early.I would definitely recommend calling your order in advance for pick-up--I don't think they deliver, unfortunately--(especially on a weekend) because everyone knows Cea-Lo Cafe is the place to get some mouth-watering Comfort Food and Soul Food.Place an order; I'm 99.70% you'll love it! (I say 99.70% because you can't please everybody. But only the weak hate Cea-Lo Cafe.)"
"The business is now taking credit cards.Waiting line is still long amid current pandemic situation.I think the management has been changed but still making good bagles..Best bagel in Baysid3.They have all different types of bagel as well as flavored creamcheese.Also have coffee, tea, and other cold drinks.However a line could get really long in the morning, especially on weekends.They do not take credit card.No parking lot and you have to find a street parking or taking a risk and double park..Um, figured I'd give this spot another try. It's been a long time since I've been back here.When I buy bagels I almost always get my favorite thing which is... Scooped out everything bagel scallion cream cheese and lox. Cost about $10 here...So I got home and they gave a ton of cream cheese... Some people like that. I thought it was a bit over kill. I could of made a 2nd bagel sandwich using it. Honestly, I just didn't like any of it. The cream cheese tasted kind of strange. I remember their bagel tasting much better before this one taste kind of stale. Omg their lox, was not good. I usually eat this sandwich in quarters...so I open up half then divide the lox and chow down. Sadly I ate 1 quarter and was disappointed threw out the rest. Had to make myself cereal instead :(Guy helping me was nice and did the best he could. The place was pretty busy. From the last time I was here their setup inside the store changed. Maybe due to covid... I went on a Saturday or Sunday... Service was a bit slow and still there was a line leading outside.While waiting outside I noticed the health dept gave them a ""B"" rating. Not a good sign... On a positive note... I didn't see the old guy who used to be grumpy and try to help people lol...Guess the only reason the place is open is due to the location. Schools near by, access to the parkway,... So convenience... If they put in some actual effort it could of been an amazing place.So ive been coming here over the years. Usually pretty happy with the bagels and coffee. Today while i was trying to pay for my stuff they had such a hard time with their new credit card machine. I always put my cards through as credit. This time after all these years they didnt know how to put it through. They kept asking for my pin number. I actually had to walk down the block to visit an atm.Behind the counter there is this older guy. He is almost always grumpy. He was helping me today. He was just so negative about the whole thing. He blamed the issue on management saying ""they"" decided to upgrade the card machine, he just kept rolling his eyes... ""they"" says its more secure for your benefit. Now in the morning the last thing i wanna deal with is someone who does not seem to like their job.Im gonna have to look for a new bagel spot. Originally, i gave this spot 4 stars but customer service mainly made me bring it down. Also, the staff should of been trained how to use their new credit card system..There are several bagel spots near here and by far this is my favorite. Besides the food... its the people that work here. They are AWESOME, friendly...the bagels are great too. I also like their different cream cheese spreads. The flavors always seem to be right on point..Sometimes when you're driving to work early in the morning, you go on auto-pilot and then your stomach does the rumblies and you're hankering for some breakfast.  So if you're going up the Clearview Expressway, you can see this light off the overpass, and you quickly take the 35th Ave exit because  you want a freshly baked bagel at 6AM.A warm onion bagel with a generous schmear of cream cheese is just what you need. $2.89?  Eh, it's aight.  Take a quick bite of the chewy, bready, creamy, crunchy texture and I turn around to get right back on the highway.  I'll finish the rest off later, otherwise the cream cheese is gonna squish out all over the car. Mmmm....BEWARE!!!  Workers NOT wearing masks!  ALSO, THEY CHARGE A 4% FEE FOR USING A CREDIT CARD!  My bill was over $16, before the fee was added!  I was was not expecting a 4% ""service fee"" for paying with a credit card.  Sign is NOT visible; it is BEHIND the counter.  When I questioned the fee on my receipt, the worker turned all the way around behind her to point to the sign....it is NOT  near the register!   Whitefish salad has bits of gray fish scales all throughout!  (UGH!!!!).  Bagels are ok, nothing special,  for $1.50.  This is not my regular bagel place; the only reason I went there today is because it was on my way home, so it was convenient, since it had already started to flurry.  My go-to bagel place has MUCH better bagels and whitefish salad, without fish scales (ugh!), and my go-to place does not charge for using a credit card!.No membership required at Bagel Club! They've got a respectable selection of bagels and spread/salads so it took me a minute to mull over my options. It would've been helpful if the bagels were labeled, but I only get everything bagels anyway. They were all out of bialys when I visited but had a sole raisin (?!?!) one left.If you're getting a smoked fish sandwich, you'll have to pay a tiny bit extra for tomato, onion, and capers though capers ended up not being available. The base price for a nova with any cream cheese bagel sandwich is $9.50. There's also a surcharge for using a credit card--bring cash like the regulars do. The regulars also seem to order lots of coffee.My nova with garlic and cream cheese on an untoasted everything bagel was terrific and was just what I needed. The bagels were a decent size, had the right amount of chew, and were absolutely coated in everything seasoning (could use a pinch of salt) both on the top and the bottom. There was a reasonable amount of salmon in the sandwich too. The garlic and herb cream cheese was a delight: not too garlicky and there was a pronounced dill flavor. Yum!.Very upsetting incident today. A tall young man came out of the kitchen to assist the front counter. He was thin, wore a red hat and had his mask on below his chin. Since he was going to wait on customers, he thought it best to pull up his mask but stopped short so that his entire nose was exposed. With the Omicron variant running rampant and every employee and customer wearing a mask, it's inconceivable that this guy didn't want to do his part. I hope the owner reads this and makes sure this guy wears his mask..This used to be my favorite bagel club.  Best flavored coffee and tofu spreads. Everything was wonderful.  I have recommended this to countless people all over the city, since it is right off the highway and there is a small parking lot in the back (if you can't easily get street parking).But, sadly, I have not been in about 2 years.  They have a B rating from the NYC DOH.  Why, oh, why?  I really hope they work to get that corrected.  Whenever I am in the area and decide to drive by, I look to see if it changed to an A....but it has not.I really hope the get re-inspected and they can earn that A rating.  I will then be happy to try it again..This is one of the best bagel spots this side of Queens. If you asked me what my favorite food is it's a bagel with cream cheese. East coast to west I have to have bagels everywhere I go.  Bagel Club has a pretty big variety compared to most bagel shops though they do stay on the traditional path and I really wish they'd make some other types like cheese bagels (and not those flat things they sell). The bagels here are dense just the way a bagel should be and the variety of cream cheese is great they have many different options but again I do wish they'd do more types of tofu but they do have 4 which is more than most. This place is always packed and I've never had a bad bagel here so I don't understand the bad reviews I've read. It's a bagel shop not a breakfast spot but they do have a few lunch items like tuna and egg salad and such but I've personally only had their bagels though this morning I saw they had some big fresh muffins and a fresh baked cheese danish that I almost ordered but I already had 2 bagels so I had to cut myself off. Next time. They also have Kombucha and their coffee is pretty good also. This is a must try if you haven't already..Good selection of cream cheese spread, bagel selection is the same as any other bagel store- not that good. I'm used to the large gourmet array of bagels from California  but nonetheless the sesame bagel with garlic and herb cream cheese hit the spot. Will be back!.SUMMARY:  Small bagel shop in Bayside that seems to have a loyal following and makes some pretty tasty bagels. Most impressive was their selection of unique cream cheeses.  Parking is definitely an issue though with only a few spots in the back.  Prepare to double park or drive down the side street for parking.BACKGROUNDEast bay (CA- SF) bagels are so ridiculously bad, we stopped eating bagels. If you've eaten real NY bagels anywhere in NY, you know what I'm saying here.  We wanted to get our fix before our flight home :)BAGELSWe got a few, but my fave definitely was their onion bagel.  Someone in the back there knows their ingredients and made a very tasty onion bagel w/ some additions of some nice spices.  We also got plain for the ride home.  Wife had an everything bagel, but it was a bit difficult to differentiate the taste between it and the onion.  Typically when we've had the everything bagel, the seeds, spices, etc are very distinct, but not so much here.  Despite that, it was still a great bagel.We got two cream cheeses to go too:  a lox and the 3 cheese with bacon.  We were less impressed with the cheese/bacon cream cheese, but the lox was spot on delicious.  Next time I'm gonna go double and get real lox plus lox spread.  I just can't get enough of the taste :)RETURN VISIT?Yes, definitely.  It's pretty close to where my wife's mother lives so it'll be a convenient walk there.  We're down to go to other places, but for now this will be our go to bagel spot."
"Ordered the salmon with a vegetable salad type thing. The salmon was cooked very well with some type of sauce on it.  It was flaky and tasted fresh.The salad was a refreshing side dish and worked well. A little pricey but thats what you expect from a kosher restaurant..Love this place. Best fish around. Staff are warm and friendly. They have a new fish special every day. I'm a huge seafood lover, so I check their website frequently to see what they have to offer. Thank you Freuds..Extremely fast delivery They are known in town for faster delivery then the ambulance! Seriously now I buy there sandwiches every day for lunch!.Just had a terrible experience with this place. Placed an order for lunch @ 11:22 PM and my order still hasn't arrived. It was scheduled to be delivered at 12:34, but when I called Yelp to check the status they advised me that the restaurant wasn't picking up the phone. This was my first time ordering from this restaurant, and they have just lost a customer. Thanks Freund's..It's not at the location Google maps shows it to be. The written address is 15th Ave but for some reason Google maps puts the location marker on 16th Ave. So read the address!"
"Very 'New York' style pizza. I go there almost every week and they never disappoint. Pizza is always fresh and tasty. I would highly recommend this place..We love pizza and will always have it on our dinner rotation!  ""Growing Up Brooklyn"" - it's a rite of passage for any true Brooklynite to have pizza as part of their diet. (Imagine the horror in the 2000s... with that Atkin's thing?!! lol) Still discovering this area and its offerings and somehow we landed with Wood Fire Oven Pizza for dinner this past weekend.  Major cravings for a good   square pizza... and we decided on a pepperoni Sicilian pie and got a small cheese one to try. Can't be a good pizzeria if their ""slice"" ain't good.   Threw in garlic knots as well. Love the Sicilian pie, garlic knots... delicious! Hits the spot.  But the cheese... left me asking ""where's the sauce?!?""   Might have to try the actual large pie... Delivery was good - the pizza was still hot. Overall - it's a hit and we will add to our dinner rotation.  Eat a pizza! #yelplife.Wow. I didn't know i'd be able to find more gems in my local area. I'm glad I tried this place and definitely recommend it to others as well. I ordered the personal sized NY pizza and Italian fries. I'm use to getting a four slice pizza pie when it's personal sized, but this place really packed it in. There was 6 slices and I couldn't even finish half of the pie. The crust wasn't as thin as normal NY pizza but it still tasted really good. It was bit bready but NOT in a bad way. The texture and flavors made me feel like I was sitting by the fire place on Christmas day. The Italian fries were a fun delight. They were topped with Parmesan and oregano. It comes with sweet chili sauce. I would say if you're not a fan of herbs then don't get it. The taste really sticks out. I was so-so about it, but it was fine when I dipped it in the chili sauce. the flavors were perfectly balanced and not overwhelming with herbs. Like the pizza, Wood Fire Oven Pizza gives a lot. I got a whole box of fries. I would definitely come back again. I really want to try the nutella calzone. It sounds really interesting. I'm not sure how the restaraunt's interior looks like but I think this place is perfect for a takeout pizza date night. The dishes just have a slightly fancier feel to it than your local pizzeria..Omg. SO good! Normally I'm a superrr thin crust kind of girl, but my stomach and eyes also agreed with this one. Meat Lover's Pie $14: 10/10 would order this again - I could've eaten the whole pie myself in one sitting for sure. It's not that big, but filling enough (I ended up eating 3 out of 6 slices) due to the meat-dough-cheese-sauce ratio. And that ratio is perfect. Every bite was a delicious blend of cheese, meat, and carbs. It's not too sauce heavy, which is perfect for my tastes. Besides the toppings (pepperoni, sausage, and ham), the other best is actually the dough. It's crispy, fluffy, sturdy enough for all the heavy toppings, and just tastes delicious. Such a good mouth chew/bite. Ordered the buffalo wings ($10) as well, but didn't try. The smell was soooo strong though, my nose almost couldn't handle it. Friend who ate this was coughing consistently so it's definitely wings that has a kick!.The best wood fired pizza and the garlic knots are so good . The pizza (in all it's variations) is spot on. Got the heart shaped for valentines.My sister and I ordered a Chicken Caesar Wrap, Truffle Fries, Garlic Knots, and Pepperoni Minis for delivery via Uber Eats* and by golly, the portions are huge! Despite sharing everything, we only made it through the wrap and the fries and even then I'm left feeling like a stuffed pig. Saving the Garlic Knots and the Pepperoni Minis for later.The Chicken Caesar Wrap was filled with fried chicken strips, romaine lettuce, fresh mozzarella cheese, and caesar sauce, and it's fucking scrumdiddlyumptious! So fresh, so tasty. It's my first time trying truffle fries and I have to say I'm not a huge fan of the truffley flavor, but my sister absolutely adores these fries. I can definitely see the two of us becoming return customers!*Listed as Father and Sons Pizzeria Inc on Uber Eats. The restaurant partners with Uber Eats but uses its own delivery staff. Delivery is crazy fast!**[ UPDATE ]Just tried the Garlic Knots and it's so oily. Too oily imo. I feel as if the garlic knots were not only brushed with oil but SOAKED and DRENCHED in oil. It's a no from me..Take-out review only: Yummy pizza! I'm happy to see an another wood fire oven pizza in this neighborhood. I got the meat lover and margherita pizza. Service was prompt and fast..Overall good local spot. We ordered the round pizza #2. I really enjoyed the char on the crust. The hot peppers were sour and spicy, they were addicting! The dough is a little chewy and doughy like the others has commented. I wish they used the good salami/pepperoni that curls up when heated instead of the pepperoni that's salty and thin. I'm not sure if a lot of people notice the difference, but you can definitely taste it. I feel like that's the major difference between fancy pizza and a dollar slice place. There's a difference I swear!Would I order again? Yeah, it's definitely one of the better pizzerias in the area..Idk what happened. This was such a gem. We told 100 ppl from our familys business about this place. It was true gourmet brick oven pizza . Now its so so bad. Idk if they switched owners or what. The best in bklyn quickly turned to poor quality and missing half the order whats happening?.By far a better pizzeria than all the oldies here. Im here since childbirth and recently took over my home from my parents and this establishment is higher quality and more respectful then any of the old timers here. Unfortunately many pizza places in bensonhurst are run by racist rude people who never found their happiness and it shows. This plays shows a respect for clients and for food and for food prep. Incredible tasting pizza go with the peporoni sicilian or the extra cheese round. Brick oven fancy looking pizza with a good ny slice taste that ny is known for. The caesar wrap is gigantic as its not made in a wrap bread or typical tortilla but a giant heavy piece of flatbread for each half. Taste similar to a big naan bread for each half . Its fried chicken like the chicken roll ,not grilled per usual but very tasty. The fries are to die for!!!! You would think they were a famous fry place. Rustic , served in a box , tasty and something youd find in a special fry house. The italian style is incredible with winning seasoning and sauce for dipping, easily worth 10 bucks but only 5. The only reason its not a 5 is because the notes were ignored and the calzones and baked items dont look anything like the picture but still i would say this new place is much better tasting much better quality and much better run than any other pizzeria we have within 10 miles of here. Thanks all!.I ordered the speciale pizza medium. Arrived a few minutes later that the one and half hour estimated delivery (the end of the estimated range). I tried the pizza. It was okay, but the dough was chewy. I like my pizza crispy with a nice crust. Order here if you like chewy pizza dough."
"Try the spring rolls. Softer than egg rolls and lighter-less oilyWe usu. get delivery and they are always on time.The prices are average for this neighborhood..Both phone numbers are not working tonight..try online orders.Plenty Of Chinese restaurants here to keep us happy,.I usually like this place but today I don't know what was happening, but they were just really crummy and at their worst. First I tried to call and place an order, only to be rushed and put on hold. Then when I get there to get the food, the lady at the counter goes and starts rushing me to do something else (also not paying attention and leaves a $5 I was paying with on the counter.) then when I get home the food is pretty meh as well. The general tso chicken was rubbery and dry, the rice was dry, and they forgot duck sauce. Extremely rushy today and it did not look like there was a lot of people..ITS CLOSED!!!!! NEW OWNERS!! Not opened yet! As of 8/30/19We have a little bit of authentic Asian cuisine right in Pelham Bay and it's called China Palace! Where the plates you order actually look and taste what they are advertised as. The food is always fresh and delicious. Delivery is fast and on time. You gotta.We have a little bit of authentic Asian cuisine right in Pelham Bay and it's called China Palace! Where the plates you order actually look and taste what they are advertised as. The food is always fresh and delicious. Delivery is fast and on time. You gotta try them!.Really good chinese food. beef with broccoli, sesame chicken and boneless spare ribs are my favorite. they also make great Appetizers like spring roll. Delivery is fast. Food is still fresh and hot like it just came out. I would highly recommend this place.It's an okay place yo grab food. Cash only unless you're on public assistance, then you can use that card. Food fine. Food is fine and the service is fast as can be. A couple tables but most food is take away..It's A local cash only Chinese food spot in the Bronx. Like most others. There's an ATM inside. I really wish reviews would be about the food and not about what a business can't control (like no parking). It's New York there's no parking ever..So I just went in for lunch and order the lunch special food was OK typical American Chinese food which is what I was looking for I asked the owner if you could turn on the heat up for about five minutes just to take the chill out of the place while I eat my lunchWell to make a long story short he didn't turn the heat on I froze my ass and I'll never go back I don't go there that often once every two weeks but I won't be going anymore I can't believe that he wouldn't turn the heat on The sign says eat in or take outIf you want to eat in a place that doesn't feel like the Arctic take the  food to goJust so you know I want to cross the street to the pizza shop they had the heat on, me Ryan's across the street had the heat on, Italian coffee shop had the heat on.Not what it used to be.  Like everything else you have to double check your delivery at the door before the delivery person leaves.  They tend to make big mistakes. e.i. I asked for extra sauce on my spare ribs and I swear they did the opposite.  Never have I received DRYER ribs!!! Complete opposite of what I asked for.  Well at least my husband ate them!.Worst Chinese food ever. Ordered this yesterday and I've got food poisoning. The fried rice was hard, not well cooked (vegetables in the rice were hard and nasty). Chicken wings weren't fully cooked and tasted old. This food messed up my husband and me. I've puked 3 times and have been running back and forth to the bathroom. My husband was lucky enough to only have to run to the bathroom. Just straight out horrible. If I could give 0 stars I would, but I guess I'll give 1 star for the delivery option..prices are high and lo mein is super oily and had no taste! cashier was mad when all i asked for was some duck sauce. don't recommend at all"
"Love this place. Never disappoints. Spicy Tuna are my favorites Coconut Bubble tea. Delish.Here in the far away land of North New Jersey there are no Hawaiian restaurants so when I traveled into the city recently I needed to make this a stop. I got a combination platter of Short Ribs and Huli chicken, garlic noodles, and barbecue pork buns. The portion sizes were very good, the taste of the short ribs was too but was disappointed by the lack of flavor in the chicken. The garlic noodles and pork buns were very very good. Service was very kind when I went in for pick up..So I don't eat sushi but I love the Makana roll and the last like two times I've come all the way from the Bronx to get one there's been a hair in my food. (( That I know isn't mine because the texture is COMPLETELY different)) Not only that but my rice is always falling apart and ALL the crab meat that comes on top of the roll comes off when I take the lid off. (( and they keep serving me the sushi in to go containers when I tell them it is for here )) Now I understand that the last part may not be completely avoidable for maybe one or two pieces this has happened before not the entire roll. Also the bathrooms are dirty there was no toilet paper in there one time I went inside you can tell no one has wiped off the sink or the back of the toilet in forever. The staff are always eating at the register, and aren't even courteous let alone polite and serviceable. I always end up having to come back and order a drink because they don't ask if I'd like one so I forget it just isn't the best customer service. They aren't rude but they're definitely doing the literal bare minimum. I just I've been going here for years and it's on a steady and consistent decline which saddens me because I literally used to take a train ride down here just for a roll and it is in no way worth it anymore..I really like this place. The food is very fresh and tasty. But honestly I come here for their green teas. They have great fruit green teas and boba tea here. Ever since Harmony closed I haven't been able to find a good boba fruit tea. So happy I found this place. I recommend the Karage whole heartedly as well as the Moco. Give them a try..Besides having a couple of Mono Locos in Honolulu, I'm not a huge connoisseur of Hawaiian food. That said, Makana has been a go-to spot over the past few months. My experiences with Makana primarily have been through delivery on Grubhub, and the restaurant has been on point every time. Many times, the restaurant delivers the food faster than Grubhub's estimated delivery, which is an A+ is you are prone to ""hanger"". Also, the restaurant is one of the few places that will bring the food to your apartment as opposed to bringing it to the front of your building and does not have a crazy delivery fee.  For first-timers, I highly recommend the ""build your own combo box"", which will give you a nice taste of a few options on Makana's menu. For the price of the combo box (around $20), you'll receive quite a bit of food. Also, the pork and fish tacos are out of this world. I cannot say that I have had any problems with the food from this restaurant. After writing this review, I may order a snack from Makana..I've been coming to this location since before they started serving corn with the meals. I miss the old set up and old servings. I absolutely loved the salad with ginger dressing. So i miss not having that. However, recently i ordered food for my mom and family. To my surprise, Makana has family meals. So i ordered two family meals of BBQ Chicken and Korean Short Ribs. It comes with rice, macaroni salad and these spam rolls. Also corn. Each family meal comes in a aluminum pan, half filled with rice and the other side filled with both types of meat. Its supposed to feed 4 to 5 people per family meal. I ordered TWO family meals for 4 adults and 1 child. They did have left overs. My family loved the food. The korean short ribs have never changed. Same recipe, seasoning and delicious flavor. I'll be back here soon. This place is always good to eat when in the area..Excited for some poké, we decided to stop by Makana to get some seemingly delicious food! The poké wasn't too costly, but they only accept credit card or cash. As New Yorkers, it was a fatal flaw on our part to have only $39 in cash for two dishes here and no credit card, foolishly assuming Makana would have Apple Pay. I am an avid fan of poké but I felt slighted at this meal! The vegetables were all bunched together as opposed to feeling more like a salad with greens that are easy to separate. The crab salad tasted subpar, although the tuna and salmon were great! Overall, I don't think I would come back to Makana. It didn't wow me like I thought it would..This place used to be sooo good.  We ordered the gyoza which were soo greasy, the kary age ""fried chicken"" which was good and some Shumai which had the tiniest amount of shrimp.  Wasnt inpressed but ordered out main dishes.  Mom had the garlic butter shrimp.  The shrimp was over cooked and I ordered the chicken katsu and BBQ beef ribs combo.  The ribs were the best part of the meal.  The chicken katsu had no taste even after dipping it in the sauce it came with, the corn had no taste the rice was pretty good tho.   All in all a waste of $60.  I won't be returning.I was feeling good and decided to reward myself some cooked food.So, I walked around and stumbled upon MAKANA. The bowl with the orange-looking sauce was fulfilling and sweet.  And since , I haven't eaten since breakfast  ( a cup of coffee ) it really hot the spot. I think it was steak or beef,  with the rice.  If I had known , I would of ordered it rare. It was too tough.Umm ... the cashier was very kind & answered all my questions.Super happy , we can still get good food during lockdown.got my order wrong and please don't offer sushi if you can't get the ginger and wasabi portions right.   unfortunately, the sushi here is so bland you really need the condiments!i tried to call them to work it out, but honestly the lady who answered was so rude.Another restaurant off the list.   i also ordered their bubble tea and it tasted like lipton iced tea with milk and tapioca... not the taste i'm used to from boba places.their hawaiian bbq is good though.  I think if you want hawaiian BBQ but sh*t customer service, this is the perfect place for you!!"
"The Pink Panther bowl is so amazing! They over a wide variety of juice, smoothies, and bowls. I will definitely be back to try more..This spot is a no brainer! The owner, Romie, does a lot for this tiny little space. I love fresh juice and for $6 per juice, it makes it easy to come back to. Plus, her customer service is great! Not only did she give me a free shot of lemon, ginger, and cayenne, she honored the 15% off Yelp check in, which was great. Lots of juice, smoothie, and other health options overall, I'm definitely going to be a returning customer..Looked forward to trying açaí bowls here but was disappointed by the lack of flavor and quality. Ordered the chocolate PB açaí bowl but it came with only bananas (the menu lists both bananas and strawberries). The açaí tasted very bland and had only a strong taste of almond milk. I ordered 30 min ahead of going to pick up the bowls and they were still not ready even though they gave me an eta of 10minutes. Also ordered a tropical dragon pitaya bowl but they gave me the dragon berry bowl instead which has a completely different variety of fruit. The blueberries tasted too ripe and old and the granola was very hard to chew on..Ssoooo slooooow it's painful. We ordered 20 mins ahead of time, arrived at 30 mins then we were told we would have to wait another 15. I caaan't! The guy at the counter was eating a salad in front of an open door- unsanitary... the woman making the smoothies was mad when we told her we couldn't wait for another 15-20 mins... threw her hands up saying she's only one person Theeeennnn the smoothies weren't the best and the juice didn't taste fresh. I want to support small biz but this one is hard.I've been going here all week for açaí bowl it's soooooo good! One of my best açaí bowls ever!!! On top of that the customer Service was amazing sweet lady she really made my day.friendly service.  Not sure where these fruits come from that are at the peak of ripeness and delicious in smoothies and bowls.  This is not a big production 1 maybe 2 ppl working so if you need something in a hurry, especially during the breakfast rush- order ahead  online !.I made the poor choice to order my juice in person so watched it get made. Juicer put on only one glove but proceeded to use both hands to handle food, in between touching fridge handle, register, FLOOR, etc. So nasty..Very simple - took me bout 40 mins to get my acai bowl which was missing a few items in it..Amazing smoothies, really reasonable and interesting combinations.My favorite is the Green Refresher which consists of soy milk, spinach, ginger, pineapple, mango, banana and apple. I wasn't sure how it would go but it tastes delicious ! They also have a variety of snacks like chia seed puddings and yogurt parfaits. Will definitely come back to try more smoothies !.Awesome smoothies!!I went here with a friend of mind to get a shot of health, I got the acai bowl and he got a smoothie, everyone was so nice and welcoming, they told us that they have just opened last week and its look like they got us already! Definitely recommended!"
"Even though its a well-known sushi powerhouse in the Omakase scene in NYC, Azabu always feels like a quaint hidden gem in an unsuspecting cobble stone street in the mostly-residential neighborhood of Tribeca. I have done Omakase here before and it was absolutely everything they said it was. I had à la carte this time in its dimly lit upstairs dining room with a very charming private ambience with great music. I thought the service was attentive while not being intrusive, as I like. The '3 kind Uni Tasting' was simply out of this world. You could taste the subtlety in the differences in all 3 of them being from all different parts of the world. Not like a LOT of other places in town that serve low quality Uni at expensive price. This one was for real! I loved the Gindara. It was so lightly marinated yet just right. Overall, I think Azabu just does what a lot of restaurants aspire to do; with its simple, understated yet amazing dishes, keeping sushi straight forward but top quality each time and without beating its drums or having to be too loud. Would dine here every chance I get!.We came here on a Saturday night and sat at a table. The restaurant was relatively empty given that it is a Saturday night. They also do not serve alcohol. Sushi Azabu gives off a more western vibe compared to most other sushi restaurants. Food: 4/5Value: 3/5 Service: 3/5The service here was not great it might've been because we were at the tables instead of the sushi counter. We ordered a Yuzu matcha, which was great it had strong matcha flavors with a hint of yuzu that made the matcha very refreshing. However, the server spilled the matcha on the table when pouring it into our cups and didn't bother wiping the spillage. They also did not adjust our chopsticks for our handedness. The service is just not what you'd expect at this price point. Again, maybe it would be better at the counters.The food, however, was good. The crab appetizer was yummy and you could really taste the the crab. The baby squid appetizer was very unique. The sashimi was good, aside from the octopus sashimi which was a little too chewy in my opinion. We also got the uni tasting, which came with 3 different types of uni from 3 different regions of Hokkaido, they all tasted great and you could really taste the different between them, one of sweet and creamy, another one hits you with intense uni flavors and has a slightly bitter aftertaste. After the uni tasting, we got to choose from 1 of 3 dishes, the king crab, the cod and the wagyu, since we had 3 people we decided to get 1 of each. My personal favorite was the crab as it reminded me of the crab I had at masa, the cod was sweet and also very good, the wagyu was disappointing as it didn't have the marbles and the fat content you'd expect from high grade wagyu. The serving size for these dishes were also a little small. All of the sushi were good, but the omakase experience just doesn't feel the same when all the nigiri is served to you on a plate instead of being served one piece at a time by the chef. Overall, the food was good, but there are definitely cheaper places you can go to for better food and service..We visited Sushi Azabu during the summer. They had a nice outdoor seating, but we wanted to sit inside, as it was a hot day. The inside looked more modern than I expected, with exposed brick wall and the pop of bright green mosaics on the wall. The back room was quite impressive. Large space with gold mural shining with natural light from the skylight.We ordered Hojicha and Chef's Lunch Omakase, which came with Seasonal Sashimi, Toro Tasting, Chef's Hot Appetizer, Chef's Choice of Sushi (Nigiri), Miso Soup, and Dessert. The amount received was a bit more than I expected, which was great. All the sashimi and sushi piece was great, they mostly just melt in your mouth. Very fresh and high quality you can taste. We also enjoyed the hot appetizer, which was a Gindara fish, it was delicious!The dessert was a bit interesting... We received the thinnest possible slice of Basque cheesecake. It was almost impressive how thin they were sliced... It was decadent and delicious though. We had an amazing sushi lunch here, every piece was super delicious, high quality, and made our taste buds to go crazy with happiness. Our server was not so friendly, but it was a-ok. I would love to go back again for more tasty sushi and/or other dishes!.This place is very hidden but I found it because it was in the area. I got the omakase which was filling and very fresh. It's about $180 but well worth it. The Genmaicha tea is lovely, you get a teapot to share and they refill the pot once it's finished. If you love a roasted tea flavor, you'll love it. The waitress was attentive and explained each dish. My boyfriend got the nigiri set which was about $72. I've tried a few high end sushi places and Azabu is in my top 3..This picture explains it all... need I say more.Sushi served with premium bug. The restaurant wasn't really apologetic and tried no damage control.When you $350 plus per person you expect not to be served bugs along with your meals..Solid place for Japanese food! Got the lunch special ikura don and tea and it was amazing! The place is quiet and has great ambiance. The ikura was great and goes so well with the rice. I also really liked the tofu that comes w it. We also got a pot of tea and it was amazing. The waitress was super patient and explained that most of the seafood came from Hokkaido!.Food: 5/5Stopped by for omakase. Overall everything was very fresh and I would highly recommend. The Toro tasting was one of the best I've ever had and the black miso cod was delicate and fluffy.Service: 5/5Our waitress was super accommodating and sweet. She explained everything very well and made our dining experience pleasurable.Ambiance: 3/5Slightly subpar compared to TriBeCa considering our dinner was roughly $500 (without alcohol).This place is BYOB for now..Love it here! Wonderful traditional omakase with good ingredients for a great price. Every course was tasty and presented beautifully. Especially loved the uni tasting and the toro tasting. Great selection of sashimi and nigiri as well:).This place is delicious and expensive and totally worth it... one of the top sushi places I've been in the world. They fly in their fish from Japan which makes everything taste super fresh. Get the omakase but expect to drop a couple hundred. I'm realizing that I like nigiri much more than sashimi but if you like sashimi this is the place to get it. We ate outside due to covid. Sushi vibes are a bit different outside but obviously the food is the main feature..I came here for lunch because I haven't had raw fish in awhile due to covid and getting raw fish delivery just isn't the same.I walked by this place after my appointment and I decided to check this place out.I love the fact the staffs do wear masks and checks vaccination status.The layout of the restaurant is really weird, when you first walk in it's very dimly lit, but then when you pass the restrooms, the back end is really well lit and the decor just didn't match with the front area of the restaurant. It almost seem like you were in two different places.The service was good, but I do want to say my food took forever to come to me, which I thought it was weird, because I don't think the restaurant was particularly busy.I got the salmon and ikura bowl and this was standard to the ones I had previously in other establishments.But the thing that didn't taste the same was the fatty tuna. Their fatty tuna didn't melt in my mouth. It just wasn't what I expected fatty tuna to be and this is why the 3 stars. It tasted like regular tuna. This is why I was super disappointed."

"3.5. This is the restaurant actually upstair of the sushi Azuba. The environment is comfortable and like the little lamp on the dining table. They really need better service, ordered 2 piece of O-toro sushi and they don't even bring it to me. Order the Uni flight, the Uni tasting dish. Have different Uni from Japan and Santa Barbara, it is quite overpriced for me, 40 dollar just for 2 kind of Uni. And it's not even that much. Also got the lobster with Uni, Uni ikura tofu, Wagyu beef roll with shaved truffle, eel with crispy soba chips, and king crab leg with crab butter. And tried the hot soba and Uni soba for main. Mochi for the dessert. The Uni flight is ridiculously overpriced. Can't believe they charge you 40 for those little sea urchins. And the Uni from Santa Barbara taste really weird. It's not fresh enough, the Uni from Japan is not sweet enough. The Uni ikura tofu was alright, just sea urchin and salmon roe and tofu. Quite underwhelming but taste good. The lobster with Uni is way too salty. I have to drink a lot of water to release my tongue after I eat that. The Uni became the sauce of lobster. So don't order if you are expecting to taste the texture of Uni from this dish. The eel with crispy soba chips is delicious. The eel just melt in your mouth with the avocado and jalapeño pepper. Highly recommend. King crab leg with crab butter is my favorite dish. The crab butter it's delicious and the crab meat is tender and juicy. A must try dish. The soba is alright... The Uni soba is just Uni with some cold soba.. No surprise. And the Wagyu beef roll with shaved truffle is delicious but I just wish they can pick better truffle. The truffle taste bad. And the service can be faster..True Japanese traditional dishes.If you love uni this is the place for you.The best deal is the Omakase.His homemade soba is cooked all dente. The one I ordered has uni.They serve it with fresh wasabi.It's as authentic as you can get..This used to be where the old Greenwich Grill used to be. But now it's a fancy soba place. The space has not changed. The curved bar in the front is still just as gorgeous and sexy as it was the last time I came here and the space is still just as intimate and quiet.It was a bit strange because on one hand, you're there for soba, so you kind of expect a more relaxed and casual environment. On the other hand, they also serve fancy things like grilled lobster with sea urchin mayo, and homemade silken tofu with with sea urchin and salmon roe, bluefin tuna with pine nuts and a raw quail egg on top, ( all of which we ordered...and were amazing...umm, yeah..), so I get why they decided to keep the decor the way it was.It's just funny juxtaposition because you go downstairs to Sushi Azabu, and it's more casual than it is upstairs.Yes, we ordered the soba to finish up the meal. My friend ordered the special I think, which was a cold soba with roe on top and dipping sauce on the side. I had the kamo seiro soba, which was served with a hot duck broth. Both were equally delicious, although I think in this case, because of the broth, the duck soba was a little bit better.For dessert, I recommend skipping the molten lava cake, instead order the shaved ice with red bean and green tea. It's delicious and just the right amount of sweetness to balance out all that savory food.I liked Daruma-Ya. I think the decor and the menu is a bit of a contradiction, but if I just isolate it to good food, and a nice, quiet place to have dinner with a friend and have a conversation, then it's a 4 in my book..Daruma-Ya is where the old ""Greenwich Grill"" was and it sure made me miss Greenwich Grill more now that I've paid a visit here. Soooo, since this place calls themselves a Soba House, I was set on trying their soba set for lunch today. First, service was very friendly and attentive. The waiter first brought us a drink menu and asked what we wanted to drink. Then, he brought us the lunch menu and we ordered the Seiro Soba set which came with kobachi & takuan. The Kobachi they offered today was Japanese eggplant (not sure if that changes from time to time) and Takuan is some pickled radish. Now, as for the Soba, we were asked if to serve cold or hot and we wanted cold soba. Their homemade soba noodles to me were seriously just ""A-OK"". I've definitely had better ones elsewhere including those from Soba-Ya on E. 9th street. And for the side dish, there could definitely be improvements to include more varieties. The whole set just looked plain and not worth the $13. And today we were constrained on time so did not have any dessert after our meal and so this review is just strictly on the soba set we have tried. Due to proximity to work place, I expect to come back here to try other items on the lunch menu in the near future. Hopefully, I will be able to come back and update my review with a better rating. Oh yes, before I forget, there was a surprise today when our bill came. The menu states that the soba set is $13, but we got charged $16 each. Did not order anything else other than soba, so not sure what happened there. Just a FYI for those who are also interested in trying this place..Love this little authentic Japanese place.Greenwich Street is divided in that near the south part when it is first formed, it teems with restaurants. North of 388 Greenwich, restaurants are scarce, and this is one of the hidden gems.Your best bet is to come during lunchtime, when lunch specials and an environment that represents the best mix of casual / romantic / professional literally rock your world.  While I've never before tried the soba sets, the lunch sets are amazing.  They're filling too - comes with tofu, a few sides, and tempura.  Whether it's tender fried chicken or beef curry, the options are wholesome and delicious.Dinner gets crazily expensive and portions are small, so it's not as good of a deal. With that said, sometimes we pool our budgets during seamless office dinners to get a bit more of Darumaya's deliciousness..In one sentence, better than Shigure, which makes it the best Izakaya in Tribeca (the best in lower Manhattan champion remains with Yopparai, IMO).Sake list is alright, standard offering. I got the Kotsuzumi Rojo Hana Ari (bloom on the path, in Eng). Smooth, silky and lightly creamy.For food, I got the tako wasa. Was good but I think Fukurou has better one. Nasu Ageni, JP eggplant in soba broth. Love it. You can't go wrong with nasu, really. My favorite of the night was the Grindara Saikyo Yai (grilled black cod in Kyoto style miso). Perfectly cooked, not a minute more or less. Uber buttery, savory though slightly saltier than I prefer. I would come back just for this one.Regardless I was full, I ordered the Seiro Soba - it is their icon dish! And i am glad I did. It was served cold along a dipping sauce which is made of kombu dashi, bonito, mirin and soy sauce. i could only finish half of it but I would def recommend it.All in all, very good meal. Service was very good; GM Nicholas was great, who told me that the Japanese owner is expanding business in the US.Would def come back whenever I want a Izakaya fare..3.5 stars for a sexy, low-key spot serving fine Japanese food. A bit pricey, but just as you'd expect from any fine dining restaurant. Portions are small so you may have to order several dishes to be full. Came here for dinner and I ordered the Ikura Bowl and a side of Washu Beef Sukiyaki. The Ikura Bowl was extremely fresh and tasty, with hints of ume in the rice blending seamlessly together with the freshness and juiciness of Ikura. The quality of the beef in the sukiyaki was good, but otherwise nothing much else stood out.My friends ordered the Omotenashi dinner set, consisting of 5 courses at $80 per set. You can tell the quality of the food is top notch and meticulously prepared, but it took way too long in between courses for the food to come out, resulting in a 3-hour long meal. -1 star for slow service. Our waiter, although very nice and friendly, seemed a little clueless about the dishes and was also not very attentive to us (not refilling our water glasses, not noticing us when we need something, etc.). -0.5 stars.I will be back to try their lunch sets, as I've heard good things about them and now know that their food quality can be trusted. But, I will not be back for dinner since it is way too expensive and service is too slow for my liking..This is one of the best sushi places I have ever gone to. The fish is very fresh, the service is amazing and the drinks are great. The cooked food is good as well. I came here twice, both times for dinner. We ordered a bunch of small plates and created a tasting menu for ourselves. The uni flight is so delicious, they give you uni from two different places, one from Japan and other is a domestic one..As a fan of Japanese small plates style restaurants, I was super intrigued after hearing about the recent opening of Daruma-Ya, which is now housed where Greenwich Grill used to be. Reservations were fairly easy to get on a Friday night, so I ended up coming at 8pm with three friends for dinner.The interior of the restaurant is modern yet simple, and best suited for small groups or dates. Daruma-Ya markets itself as a ""soba house and izakaya,"" so most of the dishes on the menu are meant to be shared. The exception is the soba, which our server described as the entree. My friends and I decided to get a few small dishes and then each get our own soba.We ordered:- Tori karaage - Came with about six pieces of chicken plus a side of miso mayonnaise. The chicken was really juicy and overall delicious!- Agedashi tofu- Three pieces of deep-fried tofu in soba broth with nameko mushrooms. The tofu was just ok, and the mushrooms were really hard to pick up with chopsticks.- Salmon tartare - Came with a quail egg, which we mixed into the tartare. It was served with chips on the side to eat it with, but there were only about eight chips so we had a bit of tartare left at the end. The salmon was pretty good, and had a slight wasabi flavor.- Dashimaki tamago - Japanese omelette, six pieces served. Decent, but nothing special.- Cold seiro soba - We're soba noobs so we had to ask the server for instructions on how to eat it (he told us to pour the dipping sauce into the empty cup, then put the soba in and add wasabi and scallions to our liking). Afterwards he gave us a teapot full of soba broth that we could mix into our leftover sauce and drink. The broth and soba were both good, but there weren't a whole lot of noodles so it wasn't very filling.The dessert menu looked interesting too, so we decided to each get one. I chose the shiso granite, which was like a syrupy shaved ice mixed with tiny bits of shiso. I also tried a bit of my friend's daifuku, which came with four pieces total (two chestnut, two strawberry) and was pretty delicious.Service, on the other hand, was incredibly SLOW. It took forever to take our orders, and our water wasn't refilled until we asked. The food itself didn't take a long time to come out, but everything else was just really slow. Dinner took about two and a half hours total. Our server was actually a really upbeat and friendly guy so I feel bad slamming the service, but it's one aspect Daruma-Ya could definitely improve on..Daruma-Ya is a newly opened restaurant and we decided to visit at the last moment after seeing it advertised on Restaurant.com. High points for delicious food, minor improvements could be made in plating and servers.I was surprised to see how large the restaurant was. At first it only looks like a bar area with 5 or 6 tables, but there's actually a larger dining area in the back which is where they seated us.They recommend 3 - 5 plates to share and then 1 soba each. To be honest, we would have been full with 3 plates and 1 soba for 2, I'll explain.We started with the homemade silken tofu with sea urchin and salmon roe. The plate itself was delicious, but the plating left something to be desired - just looked like a lump of tofu with the roe and uni dumped on top. However, taste was freshWe then got the chicken rice dish, which looks more like rice cooked in chicken broth then with chicken sprinkled in, not quite chicken on top of rice. It was simple and delicious as well, but again, plating could leave something to be desired .Our third dish was the grilled black cod with Kyoto style miso (gindara saikyo yaki). Can I say, orgasm in my mouth? Buttery, sweet, perfectly cooked, every bite was a little bit of heaven, and priced at $22, it's not bad for the amount of fish you get. This was my favorite of the night.We got a traditional cold soba (seiro soba) and a hot soba in vegetable broth. Soba tasted good, not GREAT (well, we've had better in Japan, but that's as useful as saying that we've had better tacos in Mexico...) but it was up to par for what we paid for. I did prefer the cold soba more. At the end of the meal the server pours the remaining water the soba was cooked in, into your cup with soy sauce, which you can enjoy.Our server was a little... too much? I mean, he was great! However, I think they have to find a balance between talking a lot and simply providing good service. i definitely felt that we had really great service, but I found the servers a bit too talkative. Every time they come to switch dishes they say something, and there is a lot of busing of dishes, and my husband and I just wanted a quiet romantic dinner. Sometimes the benefits of the dish are way too emphasized (like how the pasta water is supposed to help bring back some nutrients or whatever..), whereas I feel like this restaurant is all about simplicity, authenticity and taste, and that's really what should be highlighted. All in all, a great experience."
"Let me tell you, Sankaku Bar was really great. Great menu, Great atmosphere, Great service, and Great friends! Every item that we have purchased was very fresh and flavorful. Not to mention, the service was great and the staff was super helpful. Would return..Maybe 3.5 stars overall.Cozy atmosphere and I had a good time.2 stars because the sake price was really a rip-off.... A bottle you can get at store for $35 is priced 3oz pour at $20 (and he probably poured less than 3oz). I get Sankaku is an extension of Azabu but still it's not a sushi restaurant...Wagyu (Miyazaki) Tataki was really yummy.Homemade Tofu was delisious (we added uni+Ikura for $25 I'd say it's not wise)Snapper Liver - doesn't feel fresh and overpowering by heavy soy sauce.Edamame - okayShrimp Tempura 3 for $18 - fresh and juicy and delicious.5 small dishes and sake the bill was $350 after tip. It was not even dinner. Hi Tribeca!.What a charming, cozy bar! My coworkers and I got a table in the back room, which is beautiful, with tables topped with cherry blossom trees and a golden gilded painting of a tree against the wall. Service here was very nice! The waiters came by to make sure that our glasses were full, and they happily refilled my water glass (I didn't eat nor drink alcohol, I was just here to enjoy the company).Very charming place. We enjoyed ourselves here, and then headed off to karaoke..This place is a hidden gem. The sushi is great, tempura corn is heavenly, the mackerel is tasty. Also the woman that works here is awesome, knowledgeable about the menu, and helps makes the experience overall top notch. Only downfall is it's a little pricey but you get great quality..My favorite spot where I live with super cool and cozy digs, awesome bartender, delicious and totally Tokyo snacks, gazzillion sakes and the freshest draft beer.Both of the cocktails we had were excellent and all of them sound good. Austin (bartender) was really attentive and genuine.Sankaku Sake Bar is a great new place in Tribeca. Great variety of sake and shochu. The food choices are better than other sake bars. Everything from ika no Shiokara, to miso king crab, oysters, corn tempura, and much more, including anything on the. menu at the wonderful Sushi Azabu restaurant which is downstairs. The service at Sankaku is excellent. I highly recommend this place.Sankaku Bar is awesome. They have delicious snacks, high quality fish from Sushi Azabu downstairs. The grilled mackerel is my favorite larger dish.  Great selection of sake. Music selection is really good. Most of all the service is beyond amazing."
"Love it!!!!love it!!!!We were shocked and amased. Couldn't believe our eyes that place like this exists.Starting from deco....food...singers...attitude of owners, service...Thanks to our friens by choosing this place for their birthday party.We will definitely come back and inform all our friends.Thanks to owners for making this place amassing. Please keep it this way!!!!!.Beyond awful!!!I dunno how they stay open with an empty restaurant on a Saturday night. I just hope no one ever invites me for any event here again cuz I won't step foot back in here. The place is beyond awful and a huge waste of time and money.Staff including owner is Rude. Singers are disrespectful and food is not restaurant quality.Mediocre... Starting from servers, they were never near to be found. Food was blah... ( I guess they have changed a cook) My filet minion was fryed- to boile and hard to bite nothing even close of what I asked for a medim to rear. It took them about an hour to finally start serving salads and another hour to serve mane dish. What comes to music and a show It was fun to watch two old guys pretending to be young man on stage. Sad ,sad... It used to be a much better place..We celebrated my girlfriends 45th birthday here. We love the ambiance of this place!!! I was initially expecting for us to be served Russian food but it was more American. I like both so it didn't matter to us. The presentation of the food was excellent and the service was even better. They play live music and interacted with the crowd to get everyone up and dancing which I loved. Valet parking and coat check are available so that was awesome too. Would definitely come back here!.The food was amazing! I got a chance to meet with the head chef who is very well known within the neighborhood. Ilze Ritina is the best chef in Brooklyn. I will be returning soon..I was here on Saturday (9/28), my friend had an anniversary at this place and we had their banquet. Food was okay, service was not good, my friend basically had to pour shots for us and pass the food on the table throughout the night. Furthermore, my other friend wore his new suit jacket, and throughout the night, the chair he was sitting on completely destroyed the back of his jacket - there was a small metal needle that kept snagging the jacket. (careful where you sit here!) Once we tried to explain to the management what happened, they practically laughed in his face and basically said he was lying and it was impossible for it to happen, and just left him standing there. You can see on other review sites confirming how unprofessional the management is.Luckily, we had drinks (which were not part of the banquet) which made it a little bit better experience. I know I'm not coming back..I went here for a friend's 50th birthday and it was so much fun. Best party I have been to in a long time!  The food presentation was absolutely beautiful.  I tried so many different types of delicious creations. They kept putting amazing stuff out on the table. It was super impressive. The musicians are fantastic. Really dynamic, fun, and engaging. I loved all the music including the Russian pop music. If you are looking to have a party, this is a great place. Beautiful interior. Just a lot of fun..I would expect much much more for the price of this place. There are better options. I'm not sure how the service can be great but trash at the same time. We brought in a cake for my grandfather's birthday . We asked servers to bring the cake out at least 4 times. I even went to where they stored it and pointed at the cake so the server could understand. It must have been some twisted miracle becAuse after asking for two hours from 12 until 2... they did nothing. It's actually surprising. I felt like I was pouring my soul out to get my grandfathers cake and leave but nothing was working. My grandfather was sleeping. If you've been here you know how hard it is to sleep. My ears are still ringing. Long story short, we left... no idea what they did with the 50$ cake but we were not gonna waist another minute there. Most frustrating day I've had in so long. And remember after paying for your $$$$ seat you have to pay an extra 2$ cash if you want your jacket back. Does that make any sense. I'd expect the price for holding my jacket to be added to the 250$ seat. They had raw oysters  one of my favorite. But they were mediocre. Parc oasis has 1$ oysters better than here. They had some raw seafood and such too. Honestly I would have had more fun at home with friends. You can literally go anywhere else for half the price and get a better experience..Just this year I have celebrated my grandmother's 70th my mother's 50th and my 30th birthday here, need I say more! Aside from good food and fantastic service, they have a great show good music and it's BYOB. The decor is exquisite and I remember this place before became what it is! They have transformed into something worthwhile and it's about time.Just got married here this past Sunday, and very happy to note that my guests had wonderful things to say about the experience! Outstanding cocktail hour including hors d'oeuvre and drinks at the bar, with plenty of time for the guests to mingle. Excellent event space for a wedding of our size (75 people), though the space would likely be outstanding for 100 - 120 as well. Excellent dance lessons for our first dance provided by one of the talented performers at the restaurant at $75 / hour which was advantageous because we were able to practice in the same space where the wedding would take place. The performances were very entertaining. Although mostly in Russian, there were songs with English lyrics mixed in to make sure that everyone could take part and enjoy. Overall, excellent entertainment situation. Service was great! The wait-staff did a wonderful job making sure that all of the guests timely received attention with regard to food and drink. The food was also delicious and plentiful. If you're looking for a phenomenal bang-for-buck factor in throwing an event for 70 - 120 people, I recommend Encore highly. We'll likely be doing more business with Encore for future events of the sort."
"My favorite local chicken spot! I wanted fried chicken, not from a chain restaurant but from a local spot. I've been here before but it's been a long time since I've ate here. Came here on a late night around 10:30pm, place was clean and the smell of chicken cooking slapping me in the face before I came in was top tier lol. I ordered a 2 piece(breast) with potato wedges. My bf didn't want anything from there.... UNTIL WE GOT HOME and he smelled how good it was lol. The taste of the chicken was very good and different from other chicken spots and that's what my bf enjoyed the most. He said he'll def get that next time we go back. Crunchiness skin was clutch and the potato wedges were nice thick and fresh! Great affordable late night meal!.Amazing!!!! The Man in front is so friendly. Always cares for his customers. His food is muy beuno.Kennedy is Kennedy, but the employees here is what makes the difference.  The fries are always made to order, just as the other items (besides the regular chicken, it's always ready).  Whatever you want, they have it.  Shrimp, chicken, fish, hot wings, pizza, tea, coffee, ice cream, burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads... And it's halal / kosher (except for the shrimp) It is literally at the bus stop for the Q7, so you can grab a bite for the road..Chicken isn't that fresh as you think. If you want the good, fresh chicken I recommend asking for a fresh batch just to be sure."
"Well, for delivery by the airport, it's ok. Got the popcorn chicken salad and a shawarma chicken salad. My popcorn chicken salad was lots of tiny chicken tater tot sized things on lettuce. 2 sad slices of carrot and tomato. Nothing to write home about. 2 salads and a snapple set us back $25. Very tiny ranch packets. If you're starving, might not be filling enough. Just ok.The worst food ! taste horrible & the chicken is not cooked throughly !! Order somewhere else !!! They are very rude and can barely speak English.Late 2 hours and when the food arrived it was cold. Tried to talk to YELP but they never answers my MSG or phone call. Last time I use the system. Uber eat has better support and faster delivery..Don't waste your time. I ordered from here and it took them 2 hours to deliver my food. By the time it got here my order was cold and the best apology I could get was a half hearted ""sorry"" from the delivery guy. To make matters worse the food isn't even good. Order from somewhere else..This is my second time to have delivery from Kennedy's. The food is very fresh and delicious and surprisingly good for the price. If you like wings, the crispy Kennedy's hot wings will be a hit!.Horrible service.. Guy could barely speak English on the phone.. Yelled at me to hurry.. They then got my wrong order.. So it was way over priced ($10 extra).. After all that the food was alright. Would never eat there again. Rather starve..The food is really good. I love the spicy chicken sandwiches, and the hot, crispy fries. Plus, the beef patties are to die for, and the side orders are scrumptious. Just avoid the apple pie, and the mashed potatoes. Also, only get the pizza if your dying for a slice, and desperate. All in all, everything is divine!.Came here one time in order a fish sandwich it was good...& the staff is ok..."
"Had the grist, with Mac au gratin ,plantains and rice for sides. Delish! Dude at the cash register told me I had no idea how hard it was to make all this good tasting food. I told him I did and could, which is why I would rather he make it for me - lol! If you can COOK and want something you couldn't do better, this is your take out place. I know it's mine! Folks criticize the service, lack of food descriptions and visible prices. If you need any of those you are in the wrong place - lol. Ask questions and expect you platter to be around $18.00 bucks and enough food for 2 people easy!.Some of you may not know this- but my father is Haitian. I was not born in Haiti and have only had the pleasure of visiting once in my life. I eat Haitian food often. & If THIS spot is the representation of Haiti in food - THEY WIN!One day 2 or 3 years ago one of my clients gifted me fried fish from this restaurant which is a bit bizarre but I guess when ppl can't join you for lunch they buy it for you. I was NOT going to eat it and I'm here to confess it changed my life. Lol Now I'm a Good Taste girl on a Friday. Le Possoin the fried fish is like lime, crunch, soft, juicy oh my good. When you get there and you see none left you will understand man it's some good stuff. Just ask for some more and they bring more out the kitchen. The grio (fried pork) Tasso (fried goat) and macaroni are great as well. I'm sure the black rice is awesome as it is always sold out when I arrive. I want to say you have to understand how it works when you get there or you will be standing around looking dumb. They have two doors one to come in and one to come out and despite the business of Linden I always park out front. You stand in a line that wraps around the food and pick the meat and then go around and pic the sides. A normal meal comes with rice, & macaroni or salad. On my birthday I was ready to fight the young lady making the food who primarily speak Kreole because I wanted all 3 sides. But the handsome manager is always right by that area and waved her to do it anyway. Sometimes they have three types of rice but you really have to look because they do not explain anything lol. They have piklez, home made drinks like lemonade and cremas . It's always busy according to my uncle who visited NY for a month he ate breakfast every day there. I did not even know they served breakfast. It's like you go to McDonald's and I go to good taste as a treat. It's sooooo great to have homestyle Haitian food so close to home. It's not to far from my parents so sometimes I bring them dinner. I have never heard a complaint. Sometimes I listen to others explain how the line works to others and how it's soo good that they will be impressed. And it's the truth it really is. They also have various posters on the walk for Haitian musicians or lawyer or real estate which gives it an even deeper home vibe a community feeling. But they have the white marble glass and all of this fancy set up it's better than that. I'm going to tell you the absolute truth- I broke up with my boyfriend when he complained he would never eat Haitian food when I brought him here as a surprise- he was BUGGIN. This is something that's healthy tastes good and they have pescatarian and vegan options. On top of that they have some of the best food to represent my culture and I can only compare it to HQ in Miami. There is an expensive Haitian restaurant downtown Brooklyn after eating at Good Taste I could never lol  but I will continue to try new things.  **This place is not dine in. Buffet style food served by servers behind a glass. They take debit and credit and you do not have to speak French or Kreole to order. The line is always outside and takes about 5-10 minutes..The food here is sooooo amazingly good and sooo authentically Haitian! Bought some food from here to my Haitian mom who has dementia. She hasn't had Haitian food in a long long time. She loved it!!! I got her the black rice and stew chicken. Sooooo good. I live all the way in Suffolk county but this is my Haitian spot!!!! Whenever I ago to Queens, I most def have to make this pot stop..Perfection!!! Honestly, the best Haitian food I've ever had! The line is usually long which usually means it's worth it. During the week I usually get Legumes with rice and beans but on the weekend I usually get Tasso (fried goat) with rice and beans which is phenomenal! The servers aren't very friendly and the prices are pretty high but it's really good food. I usually ask for the gravy sauce to put on the rice and the pepper! Adds so much more flavor!A MUST try/eat if you're in the area!!.Good Taste delivers amazing food time after time. I've been coming to this Haitian takeout spot for years. I'm a fan of their fried fish, black rice, legume, tassot, and macaroni pie. It's something about how fresh the picklez taste. This spot is always packed with churchgoers picking up 3-4 orders of food. So be prepared to wait in line and/or hear, ""we're all out of fish."" I recommend this spot to any and everyone. Treat yaself!.I've had better Griot ! The griot was dry and the pickles wasn't as spicy or as flavorful as I have had before. Definitely some good Haitian food.The fish was good and the plantains were crispy..I've been going to this place for years. It's my favorite Haitian food spot. My ONLY complaint would be why is there no menu?? For this being a restaurant take out or not I don't like that I have to wait to get to the cashier to find out how much I owe. Plus there are several TV screens put a menu up. PLEASE. aside from that the guy who's always the cashier is always nice and has great customer service. He's a staple in this little takeout spot..Great tasty Haitian food.  They don't have a price list chart.  Therefore, they make their own pricing.  I often get the same meal. I was not keeping track of the pricing and the young-man at the register would give me different prices.  I learned their game, so I remind the guy the price he charged the last time.  The customer service is terrible. It appears that most of the servers do not understand English.  However, by no means should they not show courtesy.  The lines are very long.  Therefore, business is great.  They should be reminded that without our business they would not have been able to expand their restaurant..The BF got me takeout from here. Despite the long line he was able to get in and out pretty quickly.The food: Baked mac n cheese was pretty good. Very cheesy. Not the best but I won't say no to it. Tostones were descent. I was really hungry so those two didn't make it out of the car. Rice and beans were a little on the dry side. When I got back home I reheated it with some chicken stock to put back some moisture and flavor to my liking. The stewed chicken was dry and salty. Upon closer inspection there were some over cooked parts. I had to scrape off the sauce, cut it into smaller pieces, and I threw it with the rice to make fried rice and beans with chicken. I don't like wasting food if it can be saved..Food is great customer service is ok I guess I never really had a big issue just one time i did Uber eat they didn't put the beverage i purchase when I  called they said they didn't have it but i feel like  they should  of call ask the customers if they wanna replaced with something else"
"The greatest reminder of a great home cooked meal, a staple in the community, family oriented and always welcoming. They have been around for more than 15 years and no matter where I move to I will always order , dine in and recommend Dyckman Express & 809 Bar & Lounge.I've only ordered takeout from this place (Uber Eats), never been to the location in person. The food is always great! We like to order the family combos (either one is delicious), the white rice & red beans are always on point. Friendly customer service as well, one of the ladies was quick to give me a call to make a replacement choice for something that was out of stock. Affordable and delicious, give this place a try if you haven't!.One of the best places to eat authentic Dominican food , good serve and food quality. Friendly owner and staff. Prices are reasonable too. If your nearby and crave some Spanish dishes feel free to try this place out..This restaurant is always a must stop by spot whenever your craving for Spanish food. The food is spot on , service is fast and friendly. The owner always knows his customers and friendly. Can't go Wrong here and the prices are affordable. I strongly feel this place deserves a higher star rating..4:22 pm before I came I called told me to wait a minute then instead of waiting I came in for there to just get it instead but i end up waiting longer the lady want to ask me what I want and then start messing with the tip jar and then a coworker want to ask her something for her to tell me hold on. After already waiting ten mins for a soup that doesn't take long to serve especially if it's small . This business way of running shows there no management in this business everyone doing whatever they want . One star is being nice this place to be shut down.Came to this restaurant and ordered a passion fruit juice but was given a lemonade. Then while we were eating we saw a cockroach on the wall next to us. When we told the waitress about the roach she sarcastically laughed at it then did nothing about it. After that negative experience we just wanted to eat and leave but we noticed a tip was added automatically on the bill. Will not come back to this place..I ordered from this place and the order was missing the beans, I called in to ask for it and the lady said ""I will send you the beans for the first and last time"" mind you, it was the first time I have ever called this place. I found that very unprofessional and rude, why would I call for missing beans? I asked for the manager and they said there was not manager something I don't believe because how is that business operating without a supervisor? I DO NOT recommend this place. Worst Customer service ever, like I'm begging for food..Customer services was horrible. I went to get a lunch combo and the server was disrespectful while treating every Spanish customer with respect. They said Dyckman was not the same as it used to be and said black in Spanish after. They emphasize it was because of black people. This restaurant is races and black people should support other black businesses. This discrimination has to stop..One of my favorite places as they are opened late, I was super excited to have made it in time to breakfast.This place is always busy and food is made very often so you know its fresh.Definitely a must try.If you like horrible customer service then this is the place to go.  Couple that with increased prices post COVID (which is OK considering every other restaurant has been doing this).  But lately their portions have been getting smaller and smaller. I was there when they were packing our combo food order and noticed much less.  In fact it looked like they took our 2 orders of chicharron de pollo and made it one.... Well we asked and we got completely ignored. The manager then said we should ve grateful because they are cheaper than anywhere else and that chicken breast costs $5.99 a pound. Not sure where it costs so much but with that being said, I prefer to give my business to other small businesses..The food is good and it is the only reason why this place gets two stars.The service here is horrible-women are so nasty and always have an attitude. They also seem to place priority over deliveries because they have no problem will letting you stand there for a while without so much as an acknowledgment...they all seem sooooo busy packing up all these deliveries.  It's ridiculous actually."
"Waitress: Beautiful and had a enticing accent. I wish I knew her name, but she had an visual impact. Hookah: Tangerine. Tasted like Minute Maid Orangeade (loved it).Fun Fact: For the longest I thought when people said ""hookah"" they implied hookers. Hey, I went to Catholic school for 15 years, and I couldn't even say ""darn it"" till I was 18. * Shout Out to Michael K. (Elite) for being a catalyst for this amazing concoction!First: I call it the Ying-Yang Plate:Left Side: Plain Fries, Mozzarella, Grilled SteakRight Side: Seasoned Fries, Grilled Chicken,Cheddar CheeseTaste: Banging. Have you ever ate a dish that made you almost cry out of pleasure? To my astonishment, the food was so fresh. The grilled chicken with the crispy seasoned fries had a zesty kick with the mustard sauce.The steak with the plain fries had a ""Steak Frites"" vibe to it. The dish was problematic to share since I wanted the whole thing! Next: Grilled Chicken Platter: Grilled Chicken,Chopped Lettuce, Yogurt and Onions. Taste: Delicious.  Combination of the tart dipping sauce and the succulent chicken completed my gyro cravings. Will I go back again?: Cheah!.A place that serves alcohol and hookah.  The happy hour specials of buy one get one half off Sunday-Thurs is not bad. The service was decent, they came to check on us occasionally and made sure our hookah was burning with coal throughout the session.  They have Blue Mist! It's not the greatest Hookah spot, but for the area , I have no complaints what so ever. .  In fact, this beats some of the hookah spots in the city AND even some in Astoria. They have good loud music pumping,  call me old but sometimes I felt it was a little tooo loud.   The lighting can be a little brighter too, I found it a little hard to see. Ahh crap.. Maybe i am getting old..I am so happy that I live so close to a great hookah lounge. I went here a handful of times & Layla's never disappoints. They play great music especially on the weekends. The place gets packed fast, so try to come before 11pm or you will need to wait for a table. They have drinks which is a huge plus since most hookah lounges do not. Their drinks are pretty strong, but I usually have only one or two when I go. The hookah is so smooth and pulls nice; I love it. I would definitely recommend this place to people that live nearby..I was told by a friend that Layla Lounge has great tasting food, so I took him up on it. Upon entering, the staff asked us for ID and let us proceed to our table. The place was packed to near every table. Smoke filled the air, but not uncomfortable to when it's in your face and you can't see across you table. I don't like to smoke Hookah, so friends and I opted to just food and drinks. From a distance I saw a full bar laminating in the darkened room. Not to many hookah lounges provide a full bar, mostly stick to smoothies and beer, sometimes a mixed fruity drink. The staff was nice but slow, there were two girls running the floor for 25 or so tables. These girls hustled so I can't blame them, Ive been there before and know the hard work the comes with limited staffing. The food was surprisingly really good. We ordered a greek salad with grilled Chicken ($13) which was really fresh and the grilled chicken was delicious. It came with plenty of feta cheese and warm pita bread around the plate. My buddy also made a special request for a dish, which was cajun fries covered in 3 different melted cheeses and topped with Grilled Chicken and steak ($17). It was absolutely super caloric, I mean the plate was probably 2000 calories but worth the awesomeness with every bite. Generous enough for 3 people to consume and be filled. What drove me a bit nutty was the wait on the food. the salad took forever, and that a long time for a salad topped with a piece of grilled chicken. We wanted to order more food, but at no risk of waiting another half hour for it. Overall, Im standing by it and think it would be a great place to hang out with some friends on a low key night.P.S. They have Karaoke on Tuesdays for those who wanna let their inner Bon Jovi Out!.To start off I am a hookah fiend. I have tried numerous hookah lounges around NYC mainly in Queens (Steinway) and Manhattan.Out of all the spots I been to hands down this place wins. Not only are the hookah flavors legit, service is great, and also it is very affordable. Usually I stick to mint hookah ($12) which is my favorite at Layla's. Blue mist ($17) is also okay but sometimes it is more of a hit or miss. Their alcoholic beverages are really fairly priced for Queens IMO - Straight/on the rocks drinks are only $8 bucks.Most mixed drinks are about $7. Martinis are about $9.Beers are at an average city price of $6. They also make really good milkshakes ($5). I never ordered an actual meal from here but friends usually do and they enjoy it. I can vouch for their finger food such as onion rings and french fries. Cheap and yummy at $4 for a plate which is splitable between two people. I come to Layla's about 2-3x a month. It's a chills spot whether its a low key night, date night, or you just wanna go HAM on the drinking with a group of friends!.The hookah here is great and the waitresses here are very attentive. We came in expecting to get an iced hose but was told they don't have enough here on demand. I was a little disappointed but none the least was still satisfied by the service.I've been to Layla's more times than I can count and it's always been a good experience. Pros:The hookah - it's a hookah lounge so I'm glad they got this one right. You can mix flavors, add an ice hose, add milk, whatever. They also have a weekly special where everything is Buy One, Get One Half Off which works great for hookahs. They almost always pull great and they're pretty good at refilling your coal when it burns out.Drinks - the drinks are pretty good and usually fall between 7-11 dollars depending on what you get. (try Layla's Island!) Also, there have been times we stuck around for a while and when we asked for the check, they gave us a round of shots which is pretty cool.Location - there's always parking on the block, around the block, or across the street so driving is never a hassle.Cons:Space - Its get pretty crowded in there and it can get pretty annoying. Don't be surprised if the waitresses ask you to move you and your party because a bigger party just came in and they need to squeeze you in a corner somewhere.Volume - I've been here in the early evening once and it was mellow. It was good for conversation but after a certain hour, the music is so loud I'm literally screaming across the table to talk. Oh yeah, Tuesday nights is karaoke night which is pretty cool..Nothing special.  Basically, if you're stuck in Fresh Meadows and in desperate need of a hookah bar, this is the place for you.  If not, get yourself to Astoria or the City.Pros:- Alcohol and food are served. - Hookahs are decently priced ($10 for most basic) and have good add-on options, e.g. ice, milk, fresh fruit, etc.- The place looks very clean- Good music - that is, if you're into hardcore eurotrance while enjoying some shisha, which I am.- Coals are maintained and changed frequently.Cons:- Drinks are overpriced.  I paid $3.50 for a Snapple.  I know, shame on me for ordering a Snapple.  That leads me to my next point,- Not a great drink selection. - Food (burgers, fries, crepes) looked mediocre at best.  I say ""looked"" because I never got my food.- Not much in the way of decor.  The place feels very bare and sterile.- Waitress service seemed somewhat inexperienced and could use improvement..One of my favorite hookah spots as its super chill and casual. Watermelon + mint and blue mist are great hookah flavors here. My friends also enjoy the Layla mix. Be sure to order the fries with the Layla sauce!Avoid the ""Adios Motherf*cker"" drink, definitely tasted like windex..I swear this place was the first hookah lounge that served alcohol. It's always crowded on weekends, the hookah isn't too bad, usually my go-to flavors are blue mist or mint. They use natural coals which I find to be really good. Service could be better."
"The atmosphere is is comfortable, the service very very good and the food is DELICIOUS!  The soup is yummy and the kebabs with rice and salad outstanding and so fresh. I recommend this place highly..Good food, good service, great host, you'll enjoy yourself.   There was 8 people in our group, we ate till we were stuffed and the bill was incredibly affordable. The owner even through in dessert on the house. what a great place, a great guy and that an awesome dinning experience..I've been here a few times already and it never disappoints.  Food is always delicious and the service is always great. Very comfortable and friendly environment. It's walking distance from my house so I will def make it my regular spot. Hope they are around for a long time..Terrible service. I ordered through grubhub and waited over an hour. When I called I could barely understand what the lady said and then she hung up on me and said to check with grub hub. Gee thanks!!!  Don't order for delivery from this place..I don't think this place has been open long but there food is great! Chicken, steak, lamb and beef! Yummy yummy yummy and yummy!!! Ambiance is decent, (let's say it's not a first date kinda place)! Otherwise service is good very family oriented kinda place. Restaurant is suitable for small parties and family occasions..So the food tonight was amazing. I went there today for a 50 year old birthday party celebration. I thought it was going to be garbage based on the old ownership. I WAS COMPLETELY WORNG. THE FOOD AND SERVICE IS AMAZING. So the tables were filled to capacity of salads and other cold foods. Then the hot food came and I probably won't eat for another month Bc I couldn't stop eating. It was so good that I didn't care to eat like a cow. I'm on a hit the gym tomorrow 3x to try to work this out. The place had enough room for dancing and comfy seating. They closed the restaurant don't Bc there was about 60 of us. Will definitely be coming back.All the dishes we tried were really good. The soups, the kebabs, all really good. Nice serving sizes and not expensive, especially for kosher food..The food was alright, I thought it wasn't flavorful enough. I had the special cut beef platter and buffalo wings with fries as appetizer. The meat was obviously heated up and it wasn't heated thoroughly.. The best thing was the fries.First let me start off by saying their food is not good at all! I ordered fried dumplings (palmeni) that wasn't so bad (that is why I even give it a 1 star) their lagman noodle soup was horrible I threw it out. And the schnitzel wrap came with fries, the fries were saggy and the wrap wasn't tasty. I asked them to press the wrap and they didn't so the wrap tasted like dough. The chicken tasted like a spice I wanted to throw up from. Second the order was placed from seamless and my order came out to be $30.97. When the delivery guy came to my house he told me it was 36.97? I didn't argue I gave him $40 and said have a goodnight. I called in the restaurant and the lady doesn't know a word in English. So I speak Russian and started telling her in Russian why is it that my order on seamless says one price and the guy told me a different price she didn't even care to apologize and she said he might of got confused and mistaken the 0 for a 6? Really? (Liars and thieves) Never ordering from here again if the food was good I might of gave it another try but definitely not worth a penny!!!For the owner who commented I wrote this review April 11 2016. You guys decided to remove it and I put it back on. I know where I eat I don't need to realize anything but how horrible my experience was from this restaurant. You might be the new owner and have a new menu but please don't tell me I didn't eat from here when I did. Thank you..First let me start off by saying their food is not good at all! I ordered fried dumplings (palmeni) that wasn't so bad (that is why I even give it a 1 star) their lagman noodle soup was horrible I threw it out.

Perhaps the worst dining experience we've ever had. Waited over an hour and a half for our food and still several in our party never received their meals! And this was with placing our orders in advance! The waiting staff were tremendously unprofessional- didn't know what food was ordered or which dishes they actually managed to serve. The management couldn't seem to care less about the satisfaction of their customers- even laughing in our faces. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS TERRIBLE ""ESTABLISHMENT""!!"
"Never a bad meal. Excellent cooks, excellent and friendly staff. A must try. Desserts are to die for..I kept passing by this cozy little place for 6 years . I always wanted to try it out , specially after looking at the pictures of the different pizzas. Today my daughters wanted Italian ! What a great opportunity. The question was : are those photos for real or taken at Lombardi's ?! Well, they were real all right ! And I can walk there in my pajamas ! ( I might get taken to Creedmore but it's worth a try).Absolutely perfect! Than we had two heavenly pastas: Linguine Nere Frutti Di Mare and Rigatoni Alla Catanese and we were sold on the place ! Incredible friendliness and good humor , I wish I could complain about something, but there is nothing but praises. No ! I got a complaint: it set my dieting back by six months.Is everyone else dining at the same place? To be fair, we liked this place a few years ago. We stopped coming because the man cooking the bread/pizza kept sticking his hand into his pants to adjust himself. We heard he wasn't here any more so we returned. Not a single dish on the table was good, and two were barely edible. Both pasta dishes were over-salted and the marinara was so sour/acidic, it almost seemed like it had gone off. Also, I'm all for being comfortable but the way the staff is dressed is ridiculous. I get that this is a family business, but it's not your back yard. All 3 of them were in gym clothes, and two we wearing shorts so short it felt like we were at Hooters. They are very nice, though. Nothing here was worth returning for. Oh it's also BYOB now..Lovely pizza, I'd say not the typical NY style but you know it's good coz the dough's done right and ingredients are stellar. The only thing is their opening hours are a bit random and we tried a few times before we could finally order..Very good restaurant! Their food was very good and the places is very down low and not in a busy area. Not too hard to find parking over there. I definitely recommend going to Forno Pizzeria E Trattoria!Here are some pictures for you guys to drool.This place is great! Every time I go here the funghi pizza is cooked to absolute perfection. It's super nice paired with the alla marc salad too. I find myself craving these two way too often. The staff is always super kind and goes above and beyond (I believe it's family run). Only complaint is that it's a pricey so I can only have it once in a while. The hours to order for pickup/delivery on grubhub are also much more restricted compared to the times the restaurant is actually open. Still, 5/5, seriously a gem, please go you won't regret it!.THIS PLACE IS A GEM! If i could rate more stars I would! It is the best pizza and pasta I have had in NY. We are not from the State but when we come back for vacation we will definitely be back. The pizza crust was thin and perfectly crispy and the penne a la vodka with chicken was excellent. I have no complaints about this place. The service was impeccable and the wait staff was very friendly and well informed about their menu. When you are in town and you have the chance go visit Forno Pizzeria E Trattoria you will NOT be disappointed!!!.I walked into this cute little restaurant and was immediately greeted by the lovely Diane. I believe she runs this place. She give me total Bobs burgers Linda vibes! Love her! She creates a very warm and friendly atmosphere. This restaurant does not serve alcohol however it's byob so you can bring your own alcoholic beverage of choice. Food is soooo fresh and delicious. I ordered the Caprino salad and my boyfriend ordered a chicken Parmigiana with a side of penne. Will def be coming back soon!.The people that work here are extremely kind and patient with us. The service was great and the food was also very delicious. Everything is made from scratch..OMG, Forno Pizzeria E Trattoria is certainly rather darn cool. Can't wait to try everything off the menu here. I love their Calamari Fritti, and my friends like it too. Staff is super helpful and will certainly help you with anything. We will be coming again soon, with friends, and trying the other dishes."

"Had an amazing meal with my parents and some friends, got to our res early and had great drinks at the bar upstairs, so much room lots of space for large groups. Dinner hit the spot, Museles are to die for, blue cheese salad and croquets to start, service was more than accommodating. Safe to say I'll be back soon.Fantastic atmosphere, appetizers tasty, pesto chicken sandwich ok, service lacking. Our server never stopped by after the entrees we're dropped. Our water glasses were bone dry. We asked like 3 people for water and no one brought it. At one point we basically begged someone for water.The table next to us had to flag down a manager to ask for their server and we piggybacked and we're like can she come here too? We waited probably 30 mins for a check. I'm struggling w wether or not I'd return..Great decorations, very poor service. I'm not one to complain too much about service especially because I know how hard service people work. When we were seated, no one came to our table for at least 20 mins. Not even a glass of water. When the water did come out, one of the glasses was broken and after telling the waiter and a waitress about it, they ignored us and didn't replace the water until the end of our meal. After ordering our drinks, it also took another 20 mins to arrive. The food was also mediocre. Definitely would not recommend coming here for food. The quesadilla was dry but thank god they had some guacamole because it was not worth $17. The sandwiches were decent and I think just about the only items on the menu that was worth it. The pizza was also just regular flatbread, sauce and cheese. When asking for a to go box, we still waited another 10 mins after we already paid for the check.I would say that the host made the night. He was very kind and offer to take our pictures. He was very patient and considerate..In NYC for the Holidays and a stop at Rockafella Center in the cards but 1st the 5 of us hit Paillon which is few blocks North and East.  1st off the place is incredibly decorated for the Holidays I mean every nook & Cranny with some sort of Christmas decoration.  the upstairs in particular was appointed making this an absolute must even if you stop in for a drink.   Unfortunately, apart from the ambiance the food fell far short of acceptable. Very small menu on the 'FRENCH"" bistro side with some appetizers, sandwiches and limited entrees.   We started with a couple of French Onions soup and some Chicken Nachos for the table.   Service was brisk for food but getting extra was a challenge. Nachos looked like they just threw some salsa chips on the table then covered it with what looked like Nacho toppings but in short it was really weak.   Nothing compares the epic failure of the onion soup that was SO SALTY that it was inedible.  I mean if you have high blood pressure and your looking to stroke out try the soup.... Moving onThe Jumbo shrimp in sauce as actually pretty good, while the 2 NY Strops were simply ok. Hamburger was served on a French bread and was utterly tasteless.  The Short Rib sandwich tasted more like fried cheese steak as I could not find the short ribs at all.  The Only saving grace were the deserts which were truly outstanding.  The Chocolate cake, cheesecake and Carmel cake were all excellent. In Short stop by for a drink enjoy the ambiance for the Holidays but if expecting anything than mediocre food, then you will be very disappointed..Decor, ambience, & music: 10/10 I would come here only for the decor & ambience/pictures. The food is $17-30: the croque monsieur sandwich was still tasty & fries were great but in my opinion the food options were overpriced.The service on the night my friends & I went was not great.. we had a reservation and after being sat down, it took us 15 minutes just to get water offered to us. One of the cups given to us was cracked and after telling one of the servers, she just said oh okay and did not replace it.  Maybe it was a busy night but overall: would come here for the decor not the food/service. My cocktail was nice and sweet though..Beautiful bistro right in midtown. I love that they change the decor each season. Def check them out during the holidays. Their cocktails are stunning and I especially love their French onion soup. Staff is very friendly as well. Great lunch or date spot!.For Christmas time, add this to your list of best Christmas themed bars in NYC. My review is based solely on the decor and spirit of Christmas. We went upstairs to the second floor as the first level was closed. It was an ease to get in, we also made Reservations, just in case. We opted for seats in the bar area and not in the dining room as we only came for drinks. The staff was friendly. Bar tenders were quick with drinks and nice making them in the process. Drinks are normal NYC prices, nothing over the top like some other Christmas themed spots..Beautiful holiday decor, HORRIBLE service and cocktails! I didn't eat here so I can't speak for food. Arrived around 5pm on a Friday, the 1st floor was closed. Upstairs bar was full, there were a few seats in the back area, no one around to assist. Finally got a bartenders attention, everything we ordered was unavailable. Ordered 2 cocktails, 20 mins later still waiting, flagged down another bartender to get the bartender I ordered from. He said the cocktails I ordered were no longer available, but never came back to tell me! Ordered a prosecco and tequila with grapefruit, grapefruit juice tasted terrible. I couldn't wait to get out of that place! Took a minute to flag down the bartender for the check, he gave us the drinks on the house, so 2 starts for that. I would not recommend this place unless it's to check out the decor only if you are in the area, stick to beer or wine if you do order a drink. Disappointing they don't have any holiday cocktails.So disappointing. If you want to go to a decked out Christmas bar and restaurant, the decor here is a 10/10 for that. Unfortunately, that's about the only plus for this place. Along with the host who is incredibly friendly and will take all the pictures for you as you want with a smile. We had a reservation but were kept waiting for at least 15 minutes with no update as to what was happening with our table. Once seated our service was incredibly slow and rude. We received a broken glass filled with water and when we asked to switch the glass due to that reason, the waiter just walked away and did nothing at first. The drinks were decent but there weren't any Christmas drinks surprisingly. The food was just low quality and unflavored..This is a complete sh**hole. I mean really?Nobody in charge. Had to beg to get another drink at bar ..twice. Then when I told them ""how do you handle a busy time"" .. I was the only one there at bar. The bartender say ""WHATCA MEAN? """"And maybe you should leave.""I know hard to get people these days but damn. This was atrocious. Don't think owner cares. Nor is around. I mean this was atrocious. Here on Fri around 2-5pm and the ahh ahh bartender I guess? You call him. Was horrific. I mean worse than bad. Please DO NOT GO HERE.  Would give it minus 5 stars but seems Yelp makes me put one. A complete joke!"
"Small so there is very little space to eat inside. There were 5 of us so we had to eat outside in the cold. They have a few seats outside, which helps. The pizza was much better than I expected. Five of us ordered 5 different types of pizza and all 5 of us gave the pizza a thumbs up. Five thumbs up!Just don't count on eating inside or being comfortable if you do..Pizza is alright. Definitely a tourist crowd that comes here and leaving all these 5 star reviews. NY pizza is the best but Highline Pizza is just mediocre.Agree with a lot of the negative reviews about their staff being rude. Totally unnecessary but then again, NYC right? Hospitality is not there unless it's a 5 dollar sign establishment.Minus one star for touching money and register and then back to the pizza without gloves... wth!!!!!!Pizza can be thinner, a little thick and doughy sometimes.The only pizzeria in the area that's walking distance from my job so I'll still come here every now and then..This place was a pizza discovery for me. I have walked by never paid attention then last Monday I said self that pizza smells good. And it taste even better. Yessss!.I put Highline on a list of pizza-by-the-slice places I'd like to try while visiting Manhattan, and I'm glad I did. It has a nice casual vibe, with the employees inside joking around and friendly amongst themselves. I had two slices -- the one that I sought out because of a previous review (square-chunk chicken, intact tomato slices) was actually one I'd skip -- it was fine, but I wasn't impressed by the chicken. But the second one I had had some pork shavings, and they offered to put ranch or blue cheese on top (I went with blue cheese). It was really good. Also, the place was just super friendly. I'd definitely return..High line Pizzeria is so good especially in this area where there aren't too many $ pizza spots. I loved how fresh and chewey this spot was. I mean can you go wrong with pizza in nyc?! Nope. It's a guarantee good pizza spot from me! Add on spices available.Pizza is 5 stars. I had a regular slice and a grandma slice. The crust on both were delicious. Their cheese and tomato sauce were also on point. Pizza made well. No photos, pizzas were eaten too quickly..My kids, and I, love, love this place.. I met the owner he is super awesome.. Best pizza in Chelsea.. you have got to try it...Okkk. This is what's up! Cheap, piping hot & delicious pizza. Grabbed a slice after a day of travel. Hit the spot. Highly recommend if you're in the area! Also, appreciate the small but practical outside seating..Awesome delish pizza. Small but very friendly. None of that cold stale pizza. Must try.I was surprised at how good the pizza was, me and a friend just needed to eat something, anything, before going through the many hours of nearby Sleep No More and this was cheap and fast. I got a chicken and bacon slice. Toppings were generous and fresh, crust was sturdy enough to handle them without being too thick. Space is small and they seem to do good business so it's packed, plan on taking it to go."
"Delicious fresh breakfast. Felt like I was in Jamaica. Love the bright colors and the outside patio to eat. Short boss was very friendly and energetic. He assisted me right away. I had a mix up porridge with oatmeal and banana and fritters. Delicious thats a way to start your morning..We found this gem years ago and come back every time were in from Chicago.  Great food big portions easy on the wallet..The service was good but the food is mundane. The ackee and saltfish lacked flavor.I'm a fusion between a southern father and bajan mother so my tastebuds require the bare minimal of  at least some sort of spice or seasoning..My family and I all absolutely love Downs River. Great food and great service! I've been coming here for about a year now since I moved into the neighborhood and have never been dissatisfied with my food or the quality of service. Its a true Gem in the neighborhood..I wouldn't give this a star if I had it my way. Why work with people behind the counter and your face resembles that you don't like people...OPEN up your mouth and SPEAK when customers come in...it helps...anywho can I please have some macaroni & cheese, thanks. Wtf is this...it's bland and doesn't taste good...please take this back. While I'm waiting for my $3.27 (what's up w/the 27cent) my friend and I observe that there is a blue form on the cheesecake in the display case for people to purchase...ummm Miss please remove the molded cheesecake...I love cheesecake...I've never seen molded cheesecake before...I'm so off this. So this past wknd to top off my wonderful  experience at this restaurant my card was fraudulently used 3x in a Stop & Shop in bklyn ironically after I used the ATM in this establishment...I'm done and never coming back EVER again!!!.This restaurant has been in the neighborhood for years but have never been reviewedThis is both a take out and a dine in restaurant. They don't have dedicated serving staff but the staff make sure you're taken care of. They have just expanded and some construction is going on.The food here is authentic Jamaican food and is very good. They also make selected American dishes as fry chicken and so on.I've been coming here a while I give them 4 star, I hope they make 5 start when the construction is done.I order takeout from this restaurant quite frequently. The food is pretty good. Staff is friendly and they have an area where u can dine in. My only complaint is that they do not take cards. However there is an ATM machine inside..I love this place. I always get a homey feel when I walk in. I usually get a jerk chicken meal but their roti is just as satisfying. I definitely prefer this place over 3ds on linden blvd, but I've yet to try their oxtails! They've recently expanded a sit down area that they're turning into a juice bar, I can't wait!.I love this place. Everything is good. The staff has no attitude. They appreciate your business. Its clean . Only con is they dont deliver a lot due to driver issues. Find a reliable driver and these other jamaican restaurants will be knocked out the box. All their food is amazing.I love the availability of this place. Food is good but it is a little pricy.  I recommend it as a neighborhood favorite."
"So happy Cream survived the pandemic.  This really is a special place.  The staff are uniquely wonderful and always go above and beyond to make their customers happy.  What makes me happy is that they have Stumptown which is really hard to find.  In addition to enjoying their delicious salted caramel lattes, where they make their own salted caramel sauce, I've been buying bags of Stumptown coffee directly from Cream where they happily grind it for me so that I can make cold brew at home.  They also give you a punch-card, where if you buy 10 drinks, the 11th one is free.  It really doesn't get any better than this.  Great place and great people..I love that they serve Stumptown coffee.  Strong enough to give you that extra kick.  Lots of dairy alternatives such as soy or almond milk.  My fave is caramel iced coffee.  They also have almond croissants and a nice selection of Dough donuts if donuts are your thing.  Actually Dough makes a nice non greasy and satisfying donut with unique flavors such as hibiscus, cafe au lait and mocha almond crunch.  I was gonna get the mocha almond, but they sold out.  Maybe next time.  Service at Cream is sweet and quite accommodating, and they are an excellent addition to Bay Ridge..Their salted caramel latte was SO good! Like, exceptionally good. It's take out only at this time and they also have bubble tea too. Can't wait to try more stuff!.Cream Coffee and Tea has been operating out of a walk-up window during the pandemic, and I love how convenient it is to drop by for a quick drink (and safe since all the customers are outdoors). I can't drink coffee, so I mostly stick to their tea drinks, which are really refreshing. The passion mango iced tea (sweetened with honey) is great on a hot day, and I love the nitro mango tea. It's just as smooth and sweet as when I had it at Whistle & Fizz, and perfect for summer. One of these days, I may switch it up and get some bubble tea, but right now, I look forward to my mango tea treats!.Amazing kind  fantastic service. I am a Radiology student passing by, and had to stop by to enjoy some tasty  tea. The staff was great with helping me choose there specialty:). Whom ever is in the area or just passing by definitely give them a try :).I love this place! Great cappuccinos and the friendliest staff.  When my dog Lana spilled my drink, they were kind enough to make me another me. They are just that amazing. They also have some nice outdoor seating and walk up outdoor ordering. Please purchase from a local shop rather from a chain when you can :-).The friendliest little coffee shop! Love it here and they make such good coffee! They always remind you to use your stamp card and I think that's so nice for a business to do!.My go to spot. Carmen is such a lovely lady and she already knows my drink! I'm not sure if that's a good thing, it means I go there way too much haha! But the drinks are great and the staff is super friendly!.If you like lemonade and coffee, you must try their cold brew lemonade. It's sounds weird, but it's surprisingly yummy. I think it's my new favorite drink from there!.Very small place with only a few chairs but boy does it pack a punch. The pecan donut is ridiculous... cant go wrong with the donuts here. They should have donuts in the name. This place is More than just a coffee shop. The service was also pleasant which is always great. I would highly recommend if you are craving a coffee or tea and a donut. They do accept credit cards as well fyi..Prince wrote a sexy song about this place. Can you really blame him.This is a wonderful coffee and tea shop which has good donuts and good coffee. It's a little hipster which Bay Ridge usually is not, but I guess nobody is immune to gentrification and coffee shops have always been a little bit like this anyway. But this is a really good one and we liked it a lot. And I like you a lot. Hi."
"Five Guys never disappoints! Their portions are huge and their food is high quality. This time I tried the kosher hot dog and it is my new favorite menu item. It reminds me of Costco Hot Dogs in a way. The fries are enough for 3 people and the free peanuts are always a plus. The service and staff is great. They are super quick and efficient at providing your food and polite too. Pretty clean and has a great atmosphere and plentiful indoor seating!.I ordered a bacon burger fries and drink with all the trimmings I was to hungry and tired to take a pic it was huge fresh and tasty I really enjoyed it. Pictures next time.The app is horrible.   delivery is hit or miss.  offerings are different based on location especially stamford and the cajun fries are inedible.  why should i ever bother again?.Fast friendly service! Great food prepared fresh and hot. Clean and welcoming restaurant..It is true I am a big fan of five guys burgers. This location is no different delicious food cooked fresh. As with most New York City places there is usually a line. I recommend waiting if there is a line. The food is worth a wait. I love the little cajun fries. They are just delicious and nothing so little about them. This location is in a great area and open late..How is it possible for a burger to have ""everything on it"" and still have no flavor? I got the single with no cheese and no mayo for a pricy $8, which is a double patty burger that looks pretty good. Although the bun got soggy after being wrapped for just 15 minutes, I was still expecting at least a little flavor for my investment.  Now I am not a burger connoisseur but I have had some darn good burgers and it astonished me how a popular chain like this could completely fall to the bottom of the barrel of my burger experiences. Basically it was like eating a tofu burger with no seasoning.On the bright side, the establishment was very clean, there was lots of seating, and the service was prompt. This was a true testiment to the adage ""looks can be deceiving."" So would I EAT here again though? Nope..Love. This. Place!  It's so hard to not wanting to eat here!  When I do decide to have it, I simply place my order online and pick it up when it's convenient for me. What I usually have is:- double cheeseburger with bacon, jalapeño and mushrooms...no bread. - small cajun fries (not pictured)The service is really fast, and my food is made on point so I have no complaints about this place!  I recommend coming here. Try using the app or ordering online. It'll save you some time..Five guys always make me happy. They serve enough quantity of meal. I always order double patty, tomato, lettuce and onion. It's already beyond franchise, we feels always same tasty.Little oily fries but not bad..I spent $18 on a cheeseburger, small fries and drink. I waited for my food. Then the staff got confused and didn't know whose food was wrapped and in which bag. I was about to get my food and they kept playing around with the bags of food. I saw mine and said that's mine. Saw my number on the receipt taped to the bag. The fry kid ended up giving my bag to another customer who ended up sticking his hand in the bag. Then said this isn't mine. I said I am 52. Oh this is yours then. I was out I just threw my drink away in the trash and walked out. So disgusted with the disorganized place and letting people stick hands in the bags of other peoples food. I was so pissed and couldn't wait for another burger to be cooked. I just walked out. $18 dollars for a burger!!!! Never again..Around 8:10PM EST this evening, I entered the Five Guys to get a few burgers for myself and relatives. The cashier, Tamiko L., was very pleasant and walked me through my order. While I awaited my order I noticed a few things; one of the gentlemen flipping the burgers removed his gloves and reached for a stack of yellow cheese slices and touched it with his bare right hand. I cringed. Then, the guy who was working on the fries would remove the fired from the grease and then salt them. And when I say salt them, I mean A LOT of salt. When it was time for him to give me my order, as I saw him placing the fries in the bag, I asked for fries that were unsalted. He turned around with an irritated look and replied, ""The cashier didn't explain it to you, already?"" Explain what, exactly? I wondered. He then snatched the fries out of the bag and threw them in the trash. He then gave me a small portion of salted fries to taste and said ""taste it so you know what I mean."" I tasted one fry and replied ""it's too salty (for me). Maybe not for others, but FOR ME."" He then shot back, ""No it's not. I know what I'm doing. But, I will give you unsalted fries."" After doing so, he handed over the bag and said ""here you go"", all while displaying a condescending facial expression with a dry smile. The fact that a Five Guys team member displayed this type of attitude and took me not wanting salt on my fries as a personal attack on his character is insane to me. The fact that Five Guys would have these types of team members representing their establishment is quite questionable to me and I doubt I will return because someone with that sort of attitude will likely spit in your food."
"Heard about you guys on the Tom Kelly Show! I will have to stop by and try out this amazing place!.A pretty standard NYC pub. Prices are the usual for the UES. I ordered the ""classic reuben"" after asking the bartender if it came on rye bread, which he said it did - it was fine, but definitely not classic. It came on white bread, had mustard instead of thousand island, and I was charged $2 extra (not mentioned on the menu or by the bartender) bc I had the temerity to ask for salad instead of fries. And don't expect a buyback if you're not a regular. This would've been a 2-star review, but the classic rock playlist was on point..Ya gotta try it once. If ya do, you'll try it again. This well-regarded Upper East Side sports bar is a pleasure of good drink, good food, good people, good cheer. Delicious, fair-priced burgers, salads, steaks, Shepherd's pie, pot pie, bangers and mashed. An added delight -- the Q line's 86th St. station at Second Ave. Opened in 2017, the station features the longest escalator ride in the city and several massive ceramic versions of Chuck Close's famous photorealist portraits of artists and friends..Wow!  Amazing Brussel Spouts!  Can't wait to come visit after the Tom Kelly Show Podcast talked about this restaurant with such fun and excitement. Always looking for great Bar food in NYC! See you soon!.I heard about you guys on the TomKellyShow I can't wait to visit next time I need a great new restaurant in the area.Really comfortable place to get warm when it is cold out. Good drinks, great service. Food looks really good, but still haven't eaten here yet..Anyone within a five block radius should avoid this place if they ever want anything but peace and quiet in their life. Summer or winter.The owners don't give a shit and I sympathize with anyone closer than me.Avoid renting between 82nd and 85th between 2nd and 3rd Ave..Had such a fun time here with their Tuesday night karaoke! I went here and the staff was very friendly and I love it here!!.Came here for drinks with a group of friends. The outdoor seating area extends very far down the street they setup on and there are two TV screens setup with sports. They make you order food if you want to sit at a table. We only wanted drinks so we bought a mandatory $1 slider (because executive orders), and drank on the sidewalk, watching some sports, and whatnot before deciding it was better to just chill at the apartment.Service I have to say was very good. The bartenders and wait staff are super talkative and friendly, jokes around a lot. Would mind being back maybe once we can go back to living a normal life..A solid hang out with good bar food.  I had the fish and chips which were ok overall.  Good fries but the fish was not the best.  A great place to hang out but not for an amazing meal. If you are looking for a place to hang out definitely check this place out."
