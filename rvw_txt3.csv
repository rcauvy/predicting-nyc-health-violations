"Great spot up by Riverdale. Had a going away dinner here for a buddy moving to Austin. The food and service did not disappoint. The porterhouse for two was perfect as were the sides.I would definitely go back again!.I FINALLY made it to this restaurant after wanting to try it for 3 years.  And I will say it was not disappointed.  The hostess when I arrived was very friendly and inviting.  I had a reservation but opted to sit at the bar since there was ample seating. The bartenders were so nice and helpful with making drink and food selections. The drinks were really good. The food was also yummy. I will definitely be back.I want to give it more stars but it's a little hard. The fact that there is only one waiter on a Friday is telling of the owners commitment to their patrons. Seems like that is more staff hanging out vs serving their customers.  6 tables on the first floor for one waiter is unacceptable to be honest.  The food is good and plenty, drinks are well made, waiter is awesome but overwhelmed.   Stop by if it's your only choice..This is my second time visiting this establishment. The first time was on a Saturday night, which we were not impressed with the food. We re-visited on a Thursday evening and was much more pleased with how the food tasted. If you're looking for a good local steakhouse, this is it but I would recommend going on a weeknight. Reservations are required..We ordered takeout and splurged on the Porterhouse and the skirt steak. Also got some mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach on the side. The order was ready quickly for pick up. It's always a challenge to order steak for takeout but these guys know what they are doing hands down. The porterhouse came expertly sliced off the bone and cooked to perfection, exactly what we had ordered, medium rare. The meat was very tender on both cuts and came with pan drippings as well as a house made steak sauce. Really a treat when you get steak this flavorful. Everything was seasoned well including the sides. We lucked out finding this place!.It's 50/50 with this place.  I ordered penne vodka with shimp.  IT WAS TASTELESS.  NO SALT IN THE WATER. terrible. They put the shrimp on the side! Very dumb. My girl ordred short ribs, they were delicious..We celebrated two birthdays yesterday, my 13 year old and my mom...the employees are very nice and nice ambience, but the food was underwhelming. My husband and I had the skirt steak and it was warm, lacked flavor and wasn't tested before being placed on my plate.  My plate was covered in juices, it looked more like a stew rather than a steak.  I ordered mushrooms for the steak and they were dry and didn't appear to be fully sautéed.  We ordered a burger for my ten year old and it was served on an English muffin.  We spent $330 and we were completely disappointed.  The three stars were for the friendly service, ambience of the upstairs and the convenience of valet; things that's should be secondary in a restaurant.   Unacceptable for a ""steakhouse""..AMAZING FROM START TO FINISH!! Food is absolutely great, service is phenomenal, manager I think (blonde lady) is great!! 10/10 recommend..My husband and I had our first visit there for my birthday tonight.  We were a little early and the hostess sat us upstairs on the  top floor.  It seemed nice until the cackling, yelling and drunk patrons (7 ppl) right next to us began to be sooo loud that we couldn't even hear each other in conversation.There was no bread served or even asked if we wanted any.  The clams oreganato were okay; my husband really liked  the french onion soup.  But as we sat there and cringed each time the table screamed....we were absolutely disappointed that a steakhouse of  this caliber would allow  the patrons to turn it into a sports bar environment.  The filet mignon was not seasoned well and extremely ""spongy"".  We didn't wait to finish because we wanted to pay the check and get out.We will NEVER go back..It's a wonderful experience at Jake's...every time! Great food, quality, service and a welcoming ambience. it is so cozy and inviting, truly worth a visit. Great menu selection and priced well below what other steakhouse charge for the same, while keeping real, fun and honest. You will love the staff, young, energetic and so professional. I wish I could give it a higher rating!"
"Just wanted to shout out the management and staff at Blarney Stone for their lost-and-found policy. My niece lost her phone on Friday and we couldn't figure out where she lost it. Battery was dead, so we couldn't even call it. It turns out that she had dropped it at Blarney Stone. The staff at Blarney S found it, and charged the battery up! When we tried calling it on Sunday, a Blarney Stone employee picked the call up and explained that they would keep the phone safely for us to come pick up. Thank you, Blarney Stone!!.Had a couple beers and fish and chips. Which were good. Service was great, nice little sports bar you can get some food and beer.Drinks are reasonable. I came with 4 people with multiple drinks and food and the bill was reasonable..My Dad (RIP) owned this place in the 70's. Lot of good memories. Used to take the D train from Brooklyn to go to Rangers game when customers would give my brother John tickets..Great location super close to Penn that is open till 4am...so if you miss your train back to the island like I did at least you had a warm, comfortable place to catch a good drink and kill some time in comfort. Its everything you'd expect from an Irish pub. Good service with friendly faces willing to serve it up even though they would have loved to close early. ;).Quick service and good vibes! We came in randomly because it was pouring outside. We got a Stella and Guiness on tap here and it was solid. The bartender was friendly and the crowd gave good vibes..I mean it's an okay place.  Drinks aren't terribly expensive.  I was looking for a place that had the Knicks game on and it did.  There just weren't many people here (prolly because the Knicks stink, but even then....).  I guess it's really a place to kill some time before heading for the next train at Penn.  It does the job I guess.  Nothing bad, nothing great..I've been going to this bar for years... Before the pandemic I used to wait at the bar for my train at Penn station and I've always loved this institution. I was looking for a place to have some drinks and just relax and have some french fries and we came across the absolute best bartender in Midtown, Katie, and she was awesome. The service was impeccable and she treated us like family and I think every individual who comes across her path should tip 30%. Awesome awesome awesome... That's all I can say. What a great old school bar! Katie, my sister and my fiancé love you!.If you are looking for a good bar in New York, GO HERE!! What a fabulous time we had! We had so much fun here we went EVERYNIGHT we were in the city! Bartenders were so kind, even if I didn't like my drink they changed it out and that was only because I like a certain Grapefruit juice  :)  ( Not there fault at all ) and had no attitudes about it. We got to play all our jams and everyone danced and sang right along. We were all friends here even not knowing anyone.  We also seen Mariah Carey,  so than after Madison square garden we again popped right over to Blarney's after the concert! Great location!! They made us feel comfortable and we even got to meet Joe the owner. He was just as kind and inviting and recommended his tips in the big city. Definitely one day we will be back! Thank you, Joe for all your kindness! Your bar was a blast and thanks for treating us visitors like your friends in the big city!.Great service and great location if you are training into nyc. Had a great  experience thursday night, not sure what the bartender's name is but she was terrific, even though the place was jacked she managed to keep up with the craziness..This place is amazing. The food is great! The Bartender Shirley is great! Definitely a down home place. Best place I've visited in New York so far."
"Props to this place for been the only pizzeria open in dyckman. Everything is close do been the first day of a new year. Just order 2 slices and i just tell u I was in heaven. After drinking so much for new years I was craving pizza so bad. Pizza quality is great cheese and sauce were delicious. The first was soft and crunchy everything were perfect about these slices. Will be my go to spot for pizzas in dyckman. I highly recommend for all the pizza lovers like myself..Bad! They do not deliver freshly made pies. They reheat a pie that has been sitting around. So, you end up getting dry pizza that tastes like cardboard. Just awful!.This pizzeria is a solid option in the area, and provides good pizza, good service, and fast delivery. We ordered from here on a Friday night around 10:30, and got our order (pizza with half pepperoni half chicken parm) within the estimated delivery window. The driver called upon arrival as requested, and my fiancé met him at the front door to grab the pizza. It arrived hot and as ordered. The cheese is a bit salty and heavy, and the crust was a bit thick for my liking, thus the dock in a star. It's not true New York City pizza, but it gets the job done. The chicken parm half was especially tasty. Would try again!.Ye haters of Ananas Comosus look away... this pineapple loving review is not for the faint of heart. Only those branded with the eternal love of this fruited pizza will understand. You are my tribe.I ordered a pineapple and bacon pizza. Was it hot? Yeah! Was it delicious? Yeah! Was it reasonably priced? Yeah! Did it arrive quickly? Yeah! (Damn straight, I live around the corner) Was the order correct? Yeah! Was the pineapple canned? Yes. BOO. GET OFF THE STAGE. Was the bacon crispy? Hell yeah. I'll definitely order again.Extra bonus points for a cheap pizza place that serves salad that is not just the saddest mix of iceberg lettuce and onions. Kudos to you, Pizza Nova, for tossin' a lil' cucumber and tomatoes and olives my way. That thimble full of Italian dressing was a real slap across the face though. Next time, I'll order double..Pizza is actually good. The customer service sucks. They hung up on me because apparently there's a 3 card maximum and they couldn't charge my new debit card. They were talking about me in Spanish thinking I didn't know the language. Call and order at your own risk..Ordered some spaghetti from here. This place is not acceptable. It felt like I was eating a ball of flour, and I had to stop after a certain point. Mozarella (sp) sticks were clearly frozen and purchased in bulk from somewhere.It's food karma for eating something so gross in the first place rather than sticking to my usual ""garden"" salad. Won't make that mistake again..Delicious pizza, great service and free delivery in the area. It's fantastic! I recommend Pizza Nova to anyone looking for a decent pie. Comparatively pizza palace is nearby, but Pizza Nova has my heart..I never had such a horrible experience at a pizzeria before as I did here. I ordered a plain cheese slice. The worker repeats the order saying, chicken slice?  I repeat again cheese slice. And he says chicken?  I even point to the cheese and again say cheese. He nodded and I assumed everything was fine. Go to grab my order when it's ready and I see a sausage slice. And I tell him I never ordered this and that I again said cheese. The worker then puts the blame on me saying I changed my mind and never told him. I kindly said no, I ordered cheese. I never even said there word sausage once. And he kept insisting I ordered the sausage slice. Not once did he ever offer to correct the mistake, ending in forcing me to take the sausage slice and charging me extra for the slice I never wanted in the first place.  I will never go back to this place after the bad business ethics..I'm trying to find a quality Italian restaurant in the Washington Heights/Inwood area. Pizza Nova is not a quality Italian restaurant. It is your typical hole-in-the-wall fast-food Italian restaurant. I ordered Pasta Bolognese. First of all it was not a real Bolognese but a typical meat sauce. The sauce was also bland, something you would get out of a can. Secondly, I asked Pizza Nova to add Italian sausage to my order. They did not. Nor did they call me to clarify. Thirdly, pasta is so easy to get right... but so easy to get wrong. I asked the pasta to be cooked ""al dente"". The pasta I received was lukewarm at best and the spaghetti was as soft as mashed potatoes. Of course, I gave Pizza Nova the benefit of the doubt and called them to fix the order. They apologized as most restaurants do but they offered no solution. Pizza Nova is not recommended..One of the better pizza stores that deliver. Reasonably priced and good taste. We love the garden delight. Most pizzerias don't cook the veggies well, this place gets it right. The cheese pizza gets a 9 out of 10 from my family. Pleasant staff and easy ordering by phone."
"Excellent and tasty food, great Kababs and rice and bread. Get the carrots and raisins in the rice.  Ambience is so-so hence 4 stars but food is 5 stars..Definitely one of my top three favorite places for Kabab.We usually get for Sunday brunch the family combo  ($33) which feeds 4-6 normal people.We usually ask for carrots & raisin with the rice.Today we are going for the Bakhtar Special ($85); 5 lamb chops, 4 chicken Tikka, 4 chicken Kufta, 3 beef Tikka, 2 beef Kufta, 2 lamb Tikka, with rice, salad & bread.I asked for carrot & raisin with the rice for additional $10.We can feed an army..An Egyptian friend of mine recommended this place to me as it is apparently well known in the area amongst his friends and family and this place did not disappoint! We came in around early lunch time and there were plenty of spaces to dine in. Service was good as the waiter was very quick and we got our orders pretty fast.   I ordered the Combination No. 1 which included three pieces of lamb chops, once chicken tikka and one beef kufta, and it also came with a side of bread, rice and salad. I added the carrots and raisins to the rice, which was a great touch. The meats were cooked perfectly, as it had the right amount of seasoning and it was not dry at all. The portions were very generous, as my order could have lasted two meals.I would definitely recommend coming back here if you are looking for some good Afghani food!.This place is disgustingly. The quality of their food has gotten so bad. My entire family got food poisoning from our visit there. The prices are cheaper then others but it's deff not worth the old or stale food. The inside is not clean. It's sad cause we use to go to Bakhter at least once a month or even more but tbh this place doesn't care anymore. Please avoid so you don't have food poisoning.Nothing bad to ever say about their food. Has been consistently amazing for the past however many years I've been here! If the owners redid the decor to make it feel more like a sit down restaurant rather than have fast food vibes, I'm sure other people including myself would dine in more frequently.Food is always consistently so good!! Always satisfies the craving for afghan food but wouldn't recommend dining in here.This place is really good and a great value. I would order ahead because they take their time making the food (which is not a bad thing). The staff is really friendly. For me, it's not a place where I would take a date or go with family but if it's just you and the boys..why not? The place is clean and accommodating. I would suggest #10 which is 2 skewers of chicken tikka, rice, special bread, salad, white sauce, green sauce...for less than $10! The only reason I'm giving it a 4/5 it's cause I'm not a fan of their green sauce..When all your South Asian friends tell you to eat here, you know that this place is good.  Well, I am glad I heeded to their advice because this is the best halal meal my family and I have had!  We ordered the Family combo which includes 2 chix kufta, 1 beef kufta, 1 lamb tikka, 1 beef tikka, and 1 chix tikka over a big pile of heavenly rice.  Oh goodness, I'm salavating just typing this all out and now craving to have dinner there again!The meats were cooked to perfection - right amount of chewiness, tenderness, moistness and whatever -ness I can think of.  Even the rice was heavenly.  Give me that rice even without the meat and I will still be happy.Portions are perfect for sharing.  The family combo fed our group of 5 and we still had a doggie bag at the end.We also tried the Kulfi popsicles and they were the perfect dessert that sealed the we-will-definitely-be-back deal.!!! Note: this place is CASH only !!!.I love the food at Bakhter! It's amazing for the price as well. For around 9-10$ you get a whole skewer of meat along with the plate of seasoned rice and side salad. Their meat is seasoned super well with so much flavor and always tastes juicy and fresh. My go to dish is the rice with beef tikka and chicken tikka, boneless pieces of tender meat. However, don't go here expecting a dine in restaurant experience. It's very casual and a lot of people just order and seat themselves. They have refrigerators with lassi, mango juice, soda and water. They also have a freezer with kulfi to have something sweet after if that's what you like. I always need some dessert after I eat so a pistachio kulfi is great. Come here to have a super filling meal without breaking your bank!.Nov.25th.2018It breaks my heart to put this down on Yelp, because this was one of my favorite places to eat. I ordered a #27, 3 skewers of chicken tikka with Qabuli rice. This was my worst experience yet. The rice was dry, flavorless and tasted stale. The chicken was rubbery, tasteless and overcooked. The sauces were the only flavorful thing in my order. This place has gone down over time, to the point that I don't want to go here again. There are some great Afghan restaurants in Queens, I'm gonna have to pass on this place from now on until they make some changes. Happy Yelping!.I loved this place back in the day. But, the past couple of times I've come here, the meat on the kabob has gotten smaller, and the Kabuli rice now has less raisins but plenty of carrots? IDK, but it was the fact that they had enormous portions that made this place a gold mine! Now its like all the other Afghan kabob houses. But, Its still pretty tasty!Happy Yelping!.This place can really get packed in the evenings, and the staff a little disorganized. When I went today it was about 9:30 and it was jam packed. I left a take out order, and waited forever. I ordered chicken tikka with kabuli rice, the rice was very oily, the chicken was with the white sauce but the green sauce continues to disappoint..Loads of delicious meat, huge quantity, low prices! My only complaint is the green sauce, it leaves something to be desired. I only say that cause I douse my food in the white and green sauce! So yummy!.Love love love this place! Really only get the chicken tikka platters but it always hits the spot. Chicken tikka is seasoned nicely and always so juicy even tho it's chicken breast! The rice is SO addictive. I shouldn't admit this but even tho one person should not eat a whole rice platter on their own..I always do . Kufta ice creams are tasty too! One day I'll try their lamb chops cuz they look good too & are a good deal. Everything here is a good deal."
"When we first moved in the area, my sister was obsessed with their jerk chicken. Thats all she would get and it came with bread. A few years ago I had the fried chicken meal. It was ok. Now a few days ago I had the soup which was so so. Im honestly not sure how much business they get here still. Its never crowded. Inside has an area to sit which is surprisingly a decent size. This place needs a face lift. Its so gloomy and dull all around.I heard the jerk chicken is still good though. I would give this place 2.5/5 if I could."
"Last night we went to Bond 45 to hear Vince Giordano and The Nighthawks. They play music from the '20s and '30s and they are fantastic. Imagine 11 superb musicians in tuxedos playing just a few feet away from your table as you enjoy a cocktail and very good pizza and other Italian dishes. All this for a small cover charge of $25 per person. Vince's music was featured in Boardwalk Empire, Cafe Society, Carol, The Aviator, and many more. These impeccable musicians could play with any orchestra. There's even a small dance floor. Don't miss out on the fun!.Stop by Bond45 for dinner.  Both the Dover sole and Limoncello tart were very good.  Ronnie my server was friendly and professional.  Full of information.  Enjoyable meal.  Plan to stop by again when back in town..The food is delicious, service prompt, cocktails are rather small,The food is delicious, service prompt, cocktails are rather small, the Grammy Award-winning Vince Giordano's nighthawks are the best entertainment value in town. Your $25 music charge entitles you to three toe-tapping hours of traditional American Jazz from the 1920s..Very conveniently located across from the Hamilton theater, this Italian restaurant was reserved a month in advance to ensure we would have a table. Proximity to theater, one star. The tables upstairs are very close together. As a party of 6 we expected to be a little tight, but we were very close to the 2 parties of 4 and 3 parties of 2 that surrounded our table.  We got our menus and waters. The waiter was a bit of an ass, but apparently that is to be expected in this establishment, like it's well known by NYC'ers. Our busser, however, was fantastic. He is literally a star on his own, otherwise this would be a 2 star review. I ordered soup and bread. Husband ordered chicken parm. Soup was not bad. Bread was not bad. Chicken parm was like a chicken parm pizza, and was very filling. Husband had two whiskey drinks he enjoyed, so one star. Toward the end of the meal I needed to use the restroom, which is downstairS. Downstairs is a completely different vibe. People were spread out, laughing, talking, enjoying each other's company, unlike upstairs were everyone was sitting on top of each other. Reserve downstairs if you plan to check them out..Amazing appetizers and atmosphere was perfect!The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 star is because my salmon was not cooked all the way..I came here to see Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks and it was the best night of my trip to NY! I'm so glad they play in this wonderful restaurant. My drinks, entree, and dessert were all delicious! This place is a gem and the band is a treasure..The service was impeccable. The Gorgonzola focaccia was the best thing I've ever tasted. Our entrees were delicious and huge portions!! Had a great night here abs would definitely come back..This was Feb 27-28th. I came to the restaurant twice. Once for sit down second for to go. The sit down day was pleasant. Food is a little expensive but it was good. Could do without the spring mix on the plate but I understand the need for veggies. Our server was attentive and great as well. The next day not so great. Pick up takes forever. They seat atleast 10 tables until you get your one meal. How is that making sense? The selection was terrible you should offer the sandwich and fruit or yogurt and a drink. The meal says free but it's not, we pay with the room. It wasn't good at all. And the attendant was not too pleasant. When I visit again it'll only be seated..This is perfect for dinner before a show since the atmosphere is lovely and the food comes out quickly. I appreciated my old fashioned and ragu but the Brussels sprouts side came out cold..Friends of mine were in from out of town and they are big theater people. In between a Wednesday matinee and evening show, i met them at Bond 45 for dinner. Their play had gotten out a little earlier than expected so they texted me and told me to me them earlier than our initial meeting time. They were already seated and had ordered some appetizers since they were famished and not had a proper lunch. I had looked over the menu prior to meeting them so I already knew what I wanted. It is really a great place, the European decor is done in good taste. it is very clean and the place was packed when I arrived. I opted out of the Champagne they were drinking but I ordered the Marilena salad-arugula with walnuts, with bits of cubed cheese and olives with an olive oil dressing-it was very tasty. I then had the grilled octopus with hummus which was also very good. I opted out of dessert [Lent] and got a double espresso. My friends decided to split a piece of strawberry cheesecake which looked very tempting. The staff was accommodating and attentive and the prices are reasonable for the area. It is my go to place for lunch or dinner when friends come from out of town [or to meet pre or post theater] and I really like the breakfast they serve. I would recommend and have returned several times..I was at Bond 45 on two back to back days. The first time I was alone and came for breakfast. I was seated immediately and had my choice of the tempting breakfast buffet or something on their breakfast menu. After getting coffee, I opted for the smoked salmon Benedict which came out piping hot. This was accompanied by a small salad and diced home fried potatoes which were laced with diced red peppers. Breakfast was delicious. The next day, after seeing a show nearby, myself and 15 others were seated downstairs for dinner in two side by side tables of 8. We placed our drink orders, they had tasty focaccia brought to the table and then began looking at the menus after talking for a while. I got an Aperol spritz and we ordered two appetizers for the table-an arugula salad with diced cubes of cheese and a light dressing and a plate of fried calamari with an accompanying red sauce. These went very quickly. We then placed  our entree orders-I got the pan seared scallops over risotto which was very tasty. We were not rushed at all and it was a very enjoyable afternoon. Some opted for dessert-the nutella crepe and the chocolate cake were split among out table and we each had a taste which was great. I got a double espresso to finish my meal. Our waiter was great [I am sorry I did not get his name] accommodating and very attentive for both tables.It was a great experience and the two tables of 8 worked out very well as to a long table of 16. We will be back!!.When I was here the last time, my work people and I had just seen Matilda and we had gone to their old location. It saddened me to realize later on that that location had closed. Recently, while walking on 46th Street, across the street from Hamilton, is Bond 45. They are now serving breakfast all day. I have been there on two consecutive Sundays and the food is delicious. I was seated immediately and asked about what I wanted to drink. They brought me coffee in a small pot, about 2.5 cups worth and a small urn of milk. I then ordered the smoked salmon benedict which came with a small salad with dressing and roasted potatoes laced with red peppers. The breakfast both times was delicious. It is pricey but thoroughly enjoyable. The waitstaff was most attentive, and I would recommend and return. Within the next few weeks, they will be introducing a large breakfast buffet..I went recently after seeing a play with 13 people. They gave us a long table on one side of the room which was great as opposed to a series of small tables. As soon as we got there the table was ready, we were seated and they took our drink orders. The food was very good and the service excellent. {I had the seafood risotto] I would return without hesitation and recommend highly. Many thanks to Carmen Bottoms-Merchant for setting this up for us."
"I literally went there like 3 times yesterday whilevisiting Columbia. The muffins/pastries were amazing. I bought like 5 muffins (raisin bran, blueberry...) Really great spot right next to Columbia! Def goin back next time in town:).My very well be the worst QSR experience of my life. Rude employees, late order, told if I didn't like waiting to cancel on my phone. Employees won't even make eye contact. The whole staff is overwhelmed and over matched. Definitely of my list and I encourage everyone to not support this location until it is put under new competent management..Great sandwich with generous avocado portion. They didn't toast the bread which was disappointing but otherwise well done. Good spot for a quick lunch or breakfast on the go.I've been a few times now, and each time, I'm very pleasantly surprised. It looks like it would just be your average place for quick eats, but all of the food I've had there has been fabulous, and the people who work there are really nice. Their smoothies are really wonderful too..I got my big breakfast this super early morning since i dropped off my boyfriend at the hospital. Staffs are nice and welcome. I got hungry man combo... yes!! Im hungry came with 2 pancakes,toast,2 eggs,sausage and hashbrown also coffee. It was nothing special about food but it was fresh and hot. Good for start your morning..I have to admit, Strokos Gourmet Deli was astonishing. Wonderful ambiance, clean and good service. Every thing I've tried until now has been terrific. Crew is extremely pleasant and will help you with anything. Got ta love Strokos Gourmet Deli..Strokos has been around for a while, and seems to primarily serve those who work at mount sinai, though there are a lot of people who come by from Columbia as well.I honestly have not had much from here, since I think the last time I came I literally just got a sausage egg and cheese. This place has potential though and I will come back again more during the semester to check it out. They have a lot of food selections, and the back of the restaurant makes pizza (i think) during lunch. They also have several prepared food items.I don't remember if this place has a card minimum, but there's a lot of seating here, so if you want to sit down for lunch here, it's totally an option..There are so many options here, so my reviews are for what I have tried so far--plain bagel with cream cheese, egg and cheese on a bagel, baked ziti, caprese sandwich, and berry smoothie.It's really busy on weekdays, so it may not be a place you would go out for the sake of eating out. Nonetheless, this is definitely a place I'll go to grab a quick bite before my first class in the morning. It's also a place I would go to grab a takeout meal, and take it on campus to eat as I study. Plus, the iced coffee at Strokos is not only decent but also reasonable priced, along with other items on the menu. There aren't that many places around here that I go to routinely, but Strokos is definitely a place I know I could always go to..I had lunch catered here for a conference, and was blown away by the high quality deliciousness! The sandwiches and wraps were beautifully prepared and presented on the tray. Each of the sandwiches/wraps was perfectly wrapped in paper that I could walk around NYC with one in my hand without worrying about it falling apart. The chicken caesar wrap is absolutely out of this world! The breaded chicken is delicious, along with the caesar dressing, mixed with avocado (the Californian in me loved this touch), cheese that wasn't overpowering, and delicious veggies. Will be coming back next time I need an event catered!.I've never known the love of a NYC deli.  I've flirted with NYC-style deli's before and I once had a torrid affair with Flakowitz of Boynton Beach but never have I gazed into a counter guy's hot, sweaty face and asked, ""What's good today?""I stood behind a lithe blonde woman in line and eavesdropped on her order, her cadences, how she spoke, her inflections, the eye contact she used to get precisely what she wanted.  I think she had a good chance of getting what she wanted because of the six guys behind the counter, fully five of them were hanging on her every word.  She could have asked for a blintz, a beach ball, and her car to be washed and every dude there would have headed for the door.Me?  I could have stared at this woman's backside a little longer but beautiful women are like seashells on the beach.  I was entranced by the blazing red orbs of the cherry danishes in the front case.  Beautiful women can entrance, but they aren't as cheap as these danishes and have expectations once they're in the bag.I bought two and a coffee.  The danishes were as big as the hubcaps on Huggy Bear's pimpmobile and just as flashy.  There was no skimping on the croissant either.  Thick and chewy.  Took me almost an hour to eat both.  Every guy has a first time--for deli love--right?"
"The Brother's Cafe is perhaps the most beloved diner in all of Sunnyside. That might not seem like much praise, considering the hood doesn't have many diners to begin with. But trust when I say these guys do it right and by it, I really mean everything: excellent food, affordable prices, fast delivery, fantastic service. Any neighborhood would lucky to have them.After a shaky start just over a decade ago, they've managed to iron out the kinks to become one of the hood's most consistent businesses. They managed to renovate the space last year and the interior looks refreshed with a counter and just enough small tables / chairs for small'ish groups. The staff of brothers / friends are always hard at work and give this place a ""hustle and bustle"" vibe despite being such a small establishment. I don't think there is a bathroom for public use.Like many Latin owned diners, there is a mix of western classics and a number of Mexican options on the menu. By far, my favorite dish is their huevos con chorizo with a side of tortillas and dousing their absolutely fire salsa verde. At $7, it doesn't break the bank and the portion is really ideal. Their enchiladas are also quite good, the nachos are loaded, and their wet burrito is a monstrosity. For the American side of things, the omelettes (ham + cheese, florentine, etc) are a very tasty option and I am a fan of their basic corned beef hash with over easy eggs. Even the home fries are money.The vibe is certainly no frills and zero pretension. The brothers are all friendly, even their workers who are in and out of the place making deliveries or bringing in fresh foods. Though I tend to pay in cash, they also take credit card. In fact, they bring a credit reader whenever they make deliveries. That's pretty slick.My review is unlikely to do them justice, but I can't emphasize enough on how amazing they are. I'm truly envious of all the folks who live nearby. I wouldn't consider Brothers to be destination dining worthy, but I would make them my food lifeline for near daily consumption..The brothers are so friendly. I made an impromptu visit after reading the neighbors rave. The breakfast was filling. I couldn't finish it all. You get a lot of food for $10. It's not too spicy even though it includes chorizo and jalapeños. Sadly, two things made it a disappointing experience. No COVID precautions. Nobody was wearing a mask that I saw. Outside seating was definitely not 6 feet apart and there were no signs requiring a mask. In fact, I was the only one wearing one. Also, the server ignored me. Besides asking if I wanted more coffee, she didn't check back. I had a hard time getting her eye. She took the sauce from my table and gave it to the table next to me. When I asked for it back, she didn't ask them. I waited a long time for her to being the check. Eventually I went in to pay. No apology. It was busy so I still tipped her but I won't return. Times are tough and I don't expect to be ignored when I go out of my way to support local businesses. #dwb.Great place for breakfast/ lunch with all the usual breakfast staples, sandwiches and even Mexican food. The outdoor seating is good, even in winter, and the service is always on point. It has become one of my go-tos anytime that I'm in Sunnyside.Deliveries take a bit longer as it's a small business but the wait is worth..Today i tried their Mexican Burger Deluxe which comes with the burger, a side of fries and toppings on the side like onion ,pickles and tomatoes etc. The burger was delicious it came with a meat patty (beef) on top guacamole with jalapeños. I like that they put the toppings on the side and not directly into the burger because people has their own preference how they want there burger customized so its a good thing. Over all it was a great and delicious meal for me ..Love The Brothers Cafe! Especially their tortas & grilled chicken nachos. Best spot in Sunnyside!.This is one of the best breakfast spots in the neighborhood. My local FB group put me onto this only this year even though I've lived in the neighborhood for 9 years! Either way, finally glad I've gotten to try it. My husband and I typically order breakfast here on the weekends and I'm so impressed with how hard the cooks and staff work to get you your breakfast quickly. We've tried the omelet platters and egg sandwiches, all very solid options but where they really shine is the Mexican breakfast platters. Wow, it's A LOT in terms of quantity but also super flavorful. I don't even like beans but damn....the beans are fantastic here and it's one of the only places I actually eat beans. My faves are the Huevos Rancheros (delicious) and the Huevos Mixtecos (damn good)!The staff is super nice and one time, there was an order mix up and I ended up getting someone else's breakfast order. Unfortunately, I didn't realize it until I got home and honestly, I was just hungry, so I ate it. No regrets b/c wow, the surprise breakfast I had was still fantastic. When the staff realized the mix up, they called to apologize and even offered a credit for the next time we stop by. Amazing right there!I haven't tried any of the other options for lunch or dinner but I hear the fried chicken is good. I guess I'll have to try it soon!Thanks for being awesome Brother's Cafe!.Over all pretty good- basic chicken Caesar; they didn't put Parmesan. It's the freshly made croutons for meeeee! Will order again!.One of the many neighborhood gems in Sunnyside! Best huevos rancheros in the city. Gigantic portions and oh that salsa verde.... Overall great diner menu. Excellent friendly service. Prices are great..I had a wonderful experience at The Brothers Cafe. The whole place has a great vibe. All of the food items are excellent, their menu is terrific, I really like their Huevos a La Mexicana. Staff are incredibly friendly. They're attentive, polite and always on their game. All in all, great..This place is a great place for some breakfast and/or sandwiches. The place is very simple but the staff is very friendly and attentive. I have gotten a breakfast wrap here and it hit the spot! I got a chicken burrito and it was HUGE (see my picture). Although I wanted to eat it with my hands, it was impossible without making a huge mess so fork and knife only. I can't sing them for it though, it was delicious!"
"After a few disappointing Mexican dinners from other restaurants in the area, this place BLEW. MY. MIND. Excellent quality meat that's seasoned to perfection. Jalapeño king Torta is a must. Nachos are delivered with separate salsa and guac, a small but very appreciated detail. You are king. Cheers.Other notable dishes: steak quesadilla, jalapeño king tacos..I was feeling in the mood for a burrito bowl from Chipotle, but ultimately decided to try out an authentic bowl for once. The tortas, cemitas, and quesadillas were tempting me, but I resisted and chose the Steak Burrito Bowl ($12). The food was beautifully presented, with sour cream and my requested verde sauce on the side. With Mexican rice, pinto beans, tomatoes & other vegs, GUAC, and steak, this was a party on a platter. With the sauces, everything just meshed so well together, which was what I craved. I especially loved how creamy the beans were. True to its name, there are peppers in there so it's a bit picante! Other than that, everything tasted pretty standard. The steak was charred but definitely could have been more flavored.Overall, really satisfying meal. I would want to order again and try their other food options!.Hole in the wall gem in Greenwood! Honestly was not expecting much but this place has the best tasting al pastor I've had up and down Park Slope in the last 10 years. The pricing is super affordable and the regular tacos comes 3 to an order. I love getting their al pastor burrito bowl. Just keep in mind their salsa is made with fresh jalapeno in it so it's spicy! I learned the hard way but if you pick out the bits and seeds, it's very good mixed with everything. This has quickly became our go-to place for Taco Tuesday! Try it and see for yourself. You won't be disappointed..It was bad, nachos were bunk. Flautas were ok. Delivery gets all the points, dude came down in the rain and they had to bless him with cash so taxes from the bank wouldn't steal from him. Not the best food I ever had but makes me happy I'm moving money for the greater good. Vote 11/3.Find this little hole in the wall spot right on 5th ave! The location is very small but so cute and welcoming.The gentleman who greeted me and tone my order was very professional. The food was amazingly good! Hooked, I'm a forever customer now! I had some nachos replaced the cheese with the Mexican cheese and YUM!!!!! I love how they put the toppings on the side so it doesn't get soggy. I also had the tostadas al pastor which is also delish!Give them a try and you won't regret it!!.Yum, yum, yum... The layers of flavors in tortas are heavenly, but Jalapeno King makes a point of making the layers leave a lasting impression.  For that, I'm happy there is distance between us, otherwise I'd be uncomfortably layered lol. Eventually, I'll try other things at this tiny restaurant.  It's just really hard to deviate from the torta..Ok I've now had the flautas, the steak tostadas, retried beans, and an al pastor burrito. YUM. Authentic, good pricing, quick to order, and the guys who run it are so friendly and make you want to keep coming back. I'd by far recommend this place..I come here probably once a week and feel so lucky to have a quick, affordable, and delicious place so close to home! The tacos are delicious (al pastor especially!), but I usually go for the quesadillas which are stuffed full of delicious cheese and fillings..This is my favorite place in the neighborhood. I always get the quesillo torta to go, and it is a cheese-loving vegetarian's dream. I thought all tortas were the same until I tried theirs a few years ago, and I've never looked back. The bread is just right (not too soft like many tortas), oaxaca cheese is generously portioned, pickled jalapenos add a perfect crunch & sharpness, & the lettuce/tomato/avocado are fresh, (I always ask for only a little bit of mayo because avocado is my preferred sandwich lube), and it's a bargain at $8.50. It's big enough that I can eat half for lunch and half for dinner, when I can find the self-control. The nachos & chilaquiles are good too. And the horchata! Pro tip: get the large and take it home to mix with rum :)(Can't comment on the meat because I don't eat the stuff.) Mostly it's my favorite because they're so very friendly.Please bring your business here instead of to that silly new overpriced gentrifier taco place down the block. When Jalapeno King closed at the beginning of the pandemic and it seemed like it might be forever, I wept. But they're still here and I want them to stay forever!!.Jalapeno King you are truly outstanding, I had a lovely experience here yesterday. Jalapeno King has a positive, relaxed, friendly ambience. Really flavorful and also wholesome. The crew was extremely helpful and service is amazing. I highly recommend it."
"So I think this was the best beef patty and coco bread I've ever had.  It tasted like they made it there and it was super fresh.  The coco bread was like a lil pillow (soft and warm).  They also have a good variety of patties but run out often.  Salmon is also VERY good.  The hardo bread is always fresh and the cakes are delish!!!  It can get crowded but be patient.  Well worth the wait..Their oxtail and whiting fish are delicious. They also make a great rice& peas. Consistent flavors..Amazing oxtail (spicy)  & rice & peas. Delicious patties ( specifically chicken). Their cakes (carrot & banana ) is great! Whiting fish is great too! This is a go to spot! Small restaurant. There are no chairs to dine in, and the lines are always long (which is a great sign) however, it's worth ordering from here..I respect the fact that the are clean. I have never had an experience where the cashier handles the money and the bread or food . I so appreciate the simple things about this place. I only by bread from here never tried anything  else. Maybe one day..This place has the BEST oxtail and rice and peas and cabbage. When they actually have it the sea moss is some of the best I've had..They need  to skim off oil from their meat dishes.  When you tell them you need gravy on the rice they give  u a lot of oil. I just bought a curry goat and the rice is swimming in oil. Otherwise food is full of flavor..Canarsie will always have a place in my heart but bihhhhh, the food options there are almost non-existent. When I lived there though (and when I visit still) I stop by Delicious for food. I usually get soup or escovitch fish with rice and peas...and it's a hit every time. I just need the employees to cheer up a bit but yeah, the food is good and straight to the point. The space is hella small though, so your only option is to pick up some food on the way home or wherever you're going..The patties and bread are great, that is when they have them in stock lol it's hit or miss at the place..They have the best patties and Escovitch fish. The customer service is also excellent along with their pastries and Seamoss."
"I came here on a date a few months ago the guy sucked but the place turned out to be a real hidden gem! I ended up coming back 5 more times with friends!I've only ever ordered a steam fish with vegetables and rice from here because it is amazing!!!! Best I've ever had I mean i really enjoy itOnly cons are the bartenders don't really know how to make cocktails it's more of a rum and cook or bucket of beer place. Also anytime I've went the music sucked if there was any even playing at all.One time I literally went across the street to get colada juice because they don't even have the items for that....Overall service is cool and food is great maybe one day I'll try something else but I'm hooked on the fish and it's less then 20$Thank God for that horrible date without him I'd never find this place.Terrible customer service. Placed an order for pickup and was told it would be ready in 30mins. I arrived after 40mins and still had to wait another 30mins before I received my order. Just to find out they left something out and had to wait another 5-10mins. They weren't even busy..A Caribbean (read Jamaican spot). I've been told it's a restaurant /lounge /nightclub. This review is on the restaurant. As you walk in you MUST leave your 'Merican accent by de door because ah so it go. I swear the friends I came with all first and second-generation Americans, suddenly turned into yardies and believe you me I was a wee bit concerned. I've never heard them utter even one phrase of Jamrock before. Mind you, it's catching, because I too **blocks face** became a Jamaican. Inside the vide is nice. It's a true replica of a Caribbean neighborhood spot. Everyone seemed to know everyone. The two barmaids on duty HEH-LOW! Professional and Knowledgeable and in case you're gonna ask for a friend, they are super cute and VERY HOT, their personalities shine bright. You can sit and order from the bar or you can choose a table. I observed one or two couples that seem to be on the low (taking a sneak) scattered around but that's not our business. Menus aren't provided and this is where those hotties,  sorry, cuties **clears throat**, bar-ladies come in. I ordered the seafood platter. Wednesday is seafood night but jerk pork is also available. Their seafood platter consists of shrimp, lobster and king crab legs with the usual potato and corn sides. The potato was sliced and seemed baked. I also had an order of fries. Everything tasted just right and I almost (in true KUWTJ -keeping up with them Jamaican style) ""cried fuh meh mummah!""It isn't fancy, but it's heavenly here. Recommend! The End..I love this place cause it's a local spot and the food is Great!! I have met one of the chefs and he is extremely nice ! There are the days for specials that I like and the company is good too! I walked in a few times and HS friends hang there my neighbors I EXPECT but never asked and also some new people I met in other places chill there too !! MUSIC IS LITT TOO.I did not order food here because I already ate prior however the food smelled bomb....This spot is a super low key Carribbean bar with an average age range of 40yrs - 60yrs old....The best description I can give is picture your Island Uncles/Aunties and older cousins kicking it in the basement of the house while Grandma is throwing down in the kitchen.....Very dope spot however I will say the liquor selection is extremely limited (ie only Henny, Jack Daniels, Black label and maybe 3 other bottles....the bar is 90% wine and beer...Overall great lowkey spot; this spot should best be used for if you need to burn 1-2 hours of time in the evening for whatever reason.....very nice place to hang out. the dread ""djay"" play excellent music all night long. it gets popping about 1 or 2 am. the food is very good!!!! every evening it something there but, the best nite is saturday. i would recommend my friends and others to check it out."
"Is it just me or all Fay Das the same? Not sure how to rate this place because everything I've tried tastes the same as every other Fay Da.4 stars for consistency. Their cakes are usually very light and soft. I also really like their single serve portions because this girl has no chill when it comes to cake..Fayda has become my go-to bakery for birthday cakes! I really love their mango mousse cake, it's light and not too sweet which suits the taste buds of my parents and grandparents. You can also ask them to write a message on it (if there's room for it), don't forget to ask for complimentary candles!I also always get their curry beef puff (which rose to even greater popularity thanks to Worth It)..Should not have went putside my comfort zone in buying a milk bun. It has a bad after taste almost like they used an especially stinky milk or cream to make it. Stick to the classics that are hard to mess up like dried pork and pineapple bun..I love this bakery. All the buns are so soft and delicious. I like that things are not too sweet but great for when I Have a sweet tooth. They have both savory and sweet buns, so I definitely recommend. You could get breakfast and lunch here. They have a huge variety of treats and drinks. I love that it's inexpensive as well..Leaving a review after visiting this place regularly for the past two years. The stuff is really hit or miss, especially the items inside the heated case. I've purchased heated items from inside the case (specifically the lotus leaf wrap) and multiple times it was rancid (spoiled). The individual cakes inside the case were also stale on multiple occasions (freshness depends on how long the tray was out). I understand that the store's items are not fresh every day but selling stale or rancid items to save on food cost is a health hazard.  On top of that, prices have increased but quality has gone down..They seem to have fallen off the conveyor belt of baked goods and drink services.I went inside this chilled morning and after having learned that 99% if not all of their baked goods have lard in them, I stopped eating their foods but continued to consume their drinks. Today I ordered a hot green tea with a little honey and lemon. The woman behind the counter messed up entering the order a few times. Kept repeating iced instead of hot. I figured it was an off day for her. Turns out it's an off day for the whole shop. Finally after she got it right, and payment of $3.50 she handed me my drink with a cardboard sleeve on it and it strangely didn't feel hot but I was in a hurry. When I got to the station platform, I noticed a little black thing on the inner rim of the cup cover. I tried to drag it out with my fingers but it wouldn't budge. I thought it was a bug and then decided maybe it wasn't. I should have stuck to my instincts. I opened the lid and stuck it down in place. I saw the lemon floating on top and noticed there was no steam thus my hot tea was not hot. It wasn't even lukewarm. After I took my first two sips I noticed something floating around above the lemon. Ew!! It's a roach and I have the picture to prove it. They say no refunds or exchanges on the placard in their shop but this definitely deserves a cash refund and no exchanges. I'm already on the train out to work. But I hope they see this review and my recent uploaded photos and make some dire changes. Happy eats!.Walking in - everything was shiny and new. The technique is interesting. You grab a tong and tray and pick what you'd like. You don't have to eat it right then and there. When you bring your food items to the register, they ring you up and you can order a drink there (menus on the wall), and you can opt for to go or to stay or a combination of the two. The prices are pretty cheap. I got a drink and two pastries (1 mochi ball and 1 something else to try) all for less than $5.00! The drink was a cold ""Mochatine"" if I remember correctly. I wonder what the tine is - Ovaltine? The chocolate milk was oddly refreshing. The flavor was not typical of a regular chocolate milk anywhere else, including homemade! The guy next to me had interesting pastries; they looked like croissant bialis with elbow mac n' cheese at the center! I may have to go back and see if I saw correctly or still dreaming. I didn't see (m)any tables and chairs for customers. I was also in a rush, .. perhaps there are some somewhere. I believe it was cash only when I went. Not sure if they have implemented a credit card system yet. The ladies at the register were kind and eager to assist. I'm hoping the customer service, level of cleanliness, and quality of product remain after their grand opening time-frame. Happy eats!.Cash only, great place to grab Chinese baked goods in queens. Love their mango moose cake!.I was really pleased with this place. Everything was very clean. There's only 5 people allowed in at a time and the most important thing to remember is they are cash only and do NOT have an ATM. You walk in a take a plate and tongs and then grab what you want and bring it up to the cash register so the worker can bag it for you. We absolutely loved everything. We got the roast pork and egg custard steamed buns, roast pork triangle, egg tart, sesame ball, milk cream bread, and bubble tea. Overall everything was super good especially the steamed buns. Definitely will come back.I bought a small Chinese melon cake this evening , it was not fresh and I had to throw it away after one bite as it tasted horrible. It is the worse Chinese melon cake I have ever eaten.Sad ..Maybe it is the pandemic , it is  hard for the store to keep its food quality..I had such horrible customer service experience tonight. I went in and purchased a bunch of pastries and when I got to the counter, I asked for a ""coffee milk tea"" under the ""tapioca drinks"". While we were paying, they placed the drink on the counter and basically threw the straw towards my way. Then, I noticed there were no ""bubbles/tapioca"" on my coffee milk tea. I asked ""there's no tapioca in here?"" And they said ""NO!"" And I replied saying I asked for the coffee milk tea with the tapioca. They said ""there's no more tapioca!"" I asked why they didn't let me know and they just said no tapioca. I said I wanted to get my money back and they said no. I know it's something little but it's the principle of it. They didn't want to accommodate and they didn't inform me that there was no tapioca. So I basically just paid for an iced coffee type of drink. And they didn't even offer to either exchange the fact there's no tapioca to grass jelly or even change my drink choice. And they were laughing when I walked out. Such HORRIBLE experience. I am so disappointed because I've never experienced such horrible customer service from the times I've purchased from Fay Da Bakery. Whoever was the 2 workers working around 6-6:30pm at the WOODSIDE location, they were not friendly at all..Street parking is a must here, this place is located at a easy enough to find parking area so its all good, but also they are right next to the train station exit.CASH ONLY******* CASH ONLY!!!They only take cash here so be prepared, also they do not have an ATM here so keep that in mind. Here you will find a bunch of awesome little pastries and buns, I love particularly the CHEESE TWIST and the TUNA BUN.also they here have coffee, tea and Bubba tea.Amazing. I do love this bakery a lot. they have a lot of cakes for all occasions as well. give it a try on their baked goods you will love it as much as I do."
"First time in New York and this was the best coffee shop around us. We were looking for a local shop and couldn't find anything good. All the shops were bitter or watered down. This place has fresh espresso and the barista was especially good at preparing the coffee. I highly recommend this coffee shop!.The original (I believe) Culture on 38th st. was my absolute go-to for coffee and the occasional cookie or muffin practically every workday for many years.My company moved to Hudson Yards in Feb. 2020, so obviously I hadn't had much time at all in that office before moving to remote work, but that was enough time to discover that Culture 36 would not be an uncomfortable Bizzaro Culture experience for me, but rather featured the same incredible coffee, perfectly-made cortados and best chocolate chip cookies in the world, all with that excellent Culture service.I soon found myself once again going out of my way and passing other, closer coffee shops to come here. They are that good.  As we start inching back to at least optional office attendance, there aren't too many compelling reasons to head in yet, but... the lure of a Culture cortado and cookie is certainly a prominent one!.This was really cute place to visit. It wasn't far from my hotel so I decided to stop in on my last day and I am so happy that I did. Unfortunately because of COVID there were absolutely no seating. This was mainly a order and leave kinda cafe due to the situation. HOWEVER, the service was outstanding! The cashier/barista was so nice and he was great company! I had no idea what to order because of all of the options but he made it so easy and even talked me into getting a cookie too. I got a flat white latte and a normal coffee with a chocolate chip cookie. The coffee was great and perfect! I didn't even need more cream or sugar! Not going to lie.. the cookie was not my favorite. The barista said they were known for their cookies but I hope that isn't the truth because it was not for me... Definitely will go back to Culture 36 when I'm back in town.Working directly across the street from Culture Espresso has it's pros and cons...Pros: Everything they offer is delicious. Cons: I spend way to much money in there.  PS. How insanely perfect is that Rosetta coffee art?.Great place for coffee and baked goods The experience would have been more to glow about if the foreign white chick in front loved people and creating an experience worthy of returningI asked if there were any regular oatmeal cookies because (now I know) they only carry carry cranberry oatmeal cookie. You would have though I pulled her hair. Awful presence for a sheek coffee shop..Come in. Stop. Smell the cookies. Stop. Drink amazing coffee. Stop.Dance.You found heaven in the armpit of NYC. When you come in, you'll see me to your left behind a laptop. Wave at me! While it's not reflected in my checkins, I've come here 100 in the last year from working down the street.The cookies are always ~hawt!~ and the coffee is always reliably quality, and you know what -- so is the staff (hawt and quality) A place is as only as good as its people and the staff here is the BEST. You thought those cookies were good, well, meet the team that makes them! Musicians, poets, artists, and coders. *Most talented and fun group of baristas in the most gaseous neighborhood.* Oh.& The Muffins?From Blue Sky Bakery in Brooklyn -- high quality. And.& The Coffee?From Heart Coffee Roasters -- ethical. Continue dancing. Eat a warm, gooey cookie. Let it melt in your mouth.Smile.Repeat..Stopped by here on my way to Hillsong Church (btw y'all should check it out on Sundays 10am/ 12pm/ 2pm/ 6pm/ 8pm) and I liked it! I was actually just looking for a warm drink, because it was super cold outside and I yelped the nearest place around me. The inside is small and dark with hipster vibes and there wasn't too much on the menu except coffee. But as I'm lactose intolerant, I was skimming through to find non-dairy options. They offer almond and oat milk (no soy milk), so I decided to try out the Chai tea latte with oat milk (my first time)!It was surprisingly not bad, so me and my bf were able to finish it together before going to church! Overall, if you want a quiet, hipster moment with dark selfies, y'all should check this place out! ;).I haven't actually tried the coffee at this location yet, but it's really about those chocolate chip cookies anyway. (For the record, I've enjoyed the flat whites and cold brew at their 38th street location.) 5 stars for the cookie alone. Perfectly chewy and chocolatey..The espresso was amazing, the almond croissant phenomenal, the chocolate chip cookie lived up to the hype and the two girls on bar offered great customer service. Kenzie and Julia/Jess (I don't remember) were super helpful and gave us some recommendations for their favorite shops outside of Culture and they did not disappoint. Thanks!!.""Better than your average coffee shop""What's to cheer:- good sized decor - enough seating-  good coffee and selection- reasonably priced for Midtown Manhattan What's to jeer- Service could be faster I'll stop in again if I'm in this area."
"This hotel was neat and clean, super welcoming. The staff was amazing, especially Josh at the front desk. He was more than willing to help with all our complications with a positive attitude. We will definitely be booking here the next time we are in NYC.It has the bases covered - clean rooms. As far as everything else, just depends on your needs.We chose this location because we had an event at Cipriani 25. It was the perfect distance to walk in heels to and from the event and in the cold. It's also very close to the World Trade Center. Perfect location in that aspect. We did a decent seven mile walk around the hotel and got to see the majority of the financial district, Brooklyn bridge/water, and World Trade Center. However, this location is not ideal if you're more interested in Brooklyn, Central Park, Times Square and so on. About a 20-30 minute Uber drive.As far as the service goes, it was so-so. Nice staff but we got mixed answers about check-in. We got a mobile alert that we were already checked in. Usually that means our key is ready. When we got there, our room wasn't ready. We gave our phone number and grabbed pizza nearby while we waited. After our long walk and lunch, we hadn't heard anything so I called and they said a room was ready after-all. So we gave our phone number so we could just call them when our room was ready? Also, the house keeping staff is incredibly loud at all hours of the night. The reviews about the loud linen closets are real too. randomly banging here and there. The only benefit of those closets is that you can just open it and grab whatever you need and close it softly instead lol. When we did call for an item we missed, they brought it up fairly quickly.The overall stay was very mediocre. It did feel fairly safe to walk at night to the nearby 7-11 so that was a bonus..One of the worst hotels I've stayed at. Incredibly amounts of noise, uncommunicative, and stolen items. Every single day, the staff slam the doors of the closets and stairwells with such a ridiculous amount of force. Repeatedly, without any kind of consideration for guests or the time of day. These are obviously located right next to the rooms, and the room doors have a large gap that lets in all the hallway noise as well. By far the least peaceful hotel I've ever checked into. This happens whenever staff are working so it could be first thing in the morning, then throughout the day. Sometimes past 1AM.Again, the room doors have a huge gap at the bottom that lets in a significant amount of light/noise from the outside. Last but not least, paper thin walls, and leaving the AC in ""On"" mode makes the room very wet/humid. No soft close mechanism on some room doors so the adjacent walls will shake. The fact that this hotel can go for over $200/night is crazy.It also took a WEEK of back and forth to get my room fully serviced because they never vacuumed or change the sheets.I made sure to ask because whenever I don't, I notice that the floor and sheets are the same.This place is a motel full stop. By far one of the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Marriott should re-evaluate their standards because calling this 3 star hotel is factually incorrect..Our stay in NYC we choose this hotel. The staff are very nice here and on point to get what we needed, no time wasted when we ask for anything during our short stay. The hotel itself is close to things we needed to see, World Trade Center, Charging Bull, Ferry to Ellis Island/Lady Liberty Statue, Mortons, Bubble tea place, Subway station, 7-11. The breakfast we had was just a simple pick and grab during this pandemic era, an option for bagel, cheese egg croissant, yogurt, oj, coffee, apple juice. Microwave in the lobby. The room itself is standard size with King bed, just enough to move around and place your things.  There was a fridge and coffee maker. The thing of notice, was thin walls and heavy noisy door with slow elevators. The rest were easy and direct..If you want to avoid the higher prices of staying in Midtown/Times Square, this might be the hotel for you. It's not insanely less expensive, but if you're trying to keep to a budget, you might want to check it out. Here's a breakdown:Location - Couldn't ask for a better location in regard to nearby transit. A hop skip step away from the R/W, 1/2/3, 4/5, and J/Z lines. Times Square is about 20 minutes away by train! It's also very close to the 9/11 memorial, Westfield WTC, and the pier for the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island. The Financial District seems deserted on weekends and busy during weekdays. Bao Bao Cafe that's 20 feet away is also a gem.Staff/Services - I was originally going to leave 4 stars, but the extra one was earned by the staff. I had arrived in the early morning just to drop my bags off, and lo and behold my room was actually ready. So instead of having figure out what to do in the city before dawn, I was able to lay down, relax, and even get something to eat. This was highly appreciated after a red-eye flight. For the duration of my stay, the staff never failed to greet you when you came through the front door. While the breakfast isn't anything to write home about, it is definitely a step above a basic continental breakfast. Eggs, bacon, turkey sausage, and even make-your-own waffles are a plus when they're included with your stay.Room - People have complained that the rooms are small, but that's to be expected-- this is New York City. The King Bedroom was decently sized (for the city); same goes for the bathroom. The bed was a little firm. The TV also came pre-loaded with Netflix, of which you would need to sign into with your own account to use. The mini-refrigerator came in handy too. The elevator wait times were tame considering that I was on a very high floor..My boyfriend and I booked this hotel after reading reviews online and were super hopeful. After checking-in (and being surprised with a $250 deposit) we arrived on our floor and for our entire stay, the hallway and entire 12th floor REEKED of weed. The walls are paper thin and everything can be heard. There's only one way to heat up the food that you buy and it's ONE microwave in the lobby. They were accommodating as far as providing plates and utensils, but then again the fire alarm panel in the lobby was SCREECHING the entire time. All in all you get what you paid for but even then I would not give this a 3-4 star rating. Best part was the location to all the subway stops. Will not be staying here again..I really enjoyed my stay here! It's in a great location - you can walk to restaurants and bars, do some shopping and visit One World Trade Center. The staff are so nice and accommodating! The check in process was a breeze. And parking is easy - there's a garage right up the block! The best part - the breakfast! On the weekends it's open until 9:30! And they have everything waffles, ham, veggie sausage, omelets and coffee. I can't say enough great things about my stay. When I'm in town again, this will be an obvious choice for me!.I like staying here because it is cheaper than most places, conveniently located to several subway lines, there's breakfast incluand the staff are great. However, my last stay, I had horrible itching on my back and arms and couldn't sleep. I didn't see any bedbugs signs but it is freaky. I am waiting to get off this plane to inspect all my things. I've been checking online to see if anyone has reported bedbugs and didn't see anything so far. Edit: My bug bites appeared the next day and I have five itchy spots (4 on left arm) and 1 on my back and counting. I have downgraded my opinion of this hotel to the lowest rating. I was staying in Room 205. It is Easter Weekend so I am not sure I will get through to anybody. I will call on Monday..I can not speak higher to the quality of service and the employees that work there. The hospitality exceeded my wildest dreams. Kim and her staff made my stay one of the most memorable stays of a life time. Th financial district is where to stay its clean and you are on the Hudson. Great resteraunts board walk u cant loose..We stayed 4 nights here back in October (i know, late review) and we will probably only stay here for our NYC trips from now on. Big shoutout to Anthony at front desk. He was super nice and so professional and gave us a room on the 24th floor with a beautiful view of the Freedom Tower and the pools. We walked in to the room and it was amazingly clean. They had bottled water and a selection of coffee and teas that was replenished daily. As I started unpacking, my husband quietly called me over to the window and I looked out on the view with him with tears in my eyes. See, I'm a native New Yorker and this was an emotional return for me after moving away 7 years ago. The pools and the freedom tower brought me to tears as I remembered the events that transpired on September 11, 2001.We chose the bed close to the window and my husband always remembered to open the blinds first thing in the morning for me. Our friends that traveled with us and shared our room were amazed at the view as well. The hotel was a hop, skip, and a jump away from the train station. Walking distance to the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, Freedom Tower, the Oculus, and many dining establishments including Eataly! We went to the bar on the 6th floor and enjoyed the view while sipping on some drinks.Again, we would definitely stay here again and again! Thank you for a memorable stay."
"A large variety  menu - fish on a Friday night  - great comfort food - delicious - yasssss. Open kitchen.  Very clean. Professional & courteous..It's your basic casual seafood spot. Good if you're having a hard time figuring out what you want to eat. I've eaten here a few times and tried almost all their sides, nothing was special but still good. This time I ordered online and picked up in store ( it's a small place with a counter not a sit down atmosphere ) I stood for almost 10 minutes waiting to even say "" Hi I'm here for my order,"" ( which was ready ) while the cashier had a conversation with a male friend. I listened as she spoke about his plans for the day etc.  When they were finally done, he left with no food in hand and PAYING customers lined up against the wall WAITING for it to be done. Extremely unprofessional, made me question the food and for that I would not return again..3.5/5- Rounding up for friendly serviceCame by on a random weekday in the morning. The shop was really quiet cause of the weather. Service was really friendly and they were really understanding when I realized this place was cash only and I didn't have enough cash for everything I wanted.For my meal I got the create your own combo which comes with 2 proteins and a side of fries. I also ordered two sides on top of that.1) Catfish: The cuts were a bit thin so they got a bit overcooked. The seasoning was hearty but between how thick it was and how thin the catfish was I just didn't get any satisfying bites of fish (3/5)2) Scallops: Not judging this one on the batter cause by the time I got it home the steam from the box sort of disintegrated the batter. The scallops were plump though and it came with 7 pieces which is a sizeable portion. Not overcooked but definitely on the more well done side (3.75/5)3) Fries: Great fries! Crispy outside, very well seasoned, and still a bit of fluff inside. (4.5/5)4) Potato Salad: Admittedly I'm not the biggest fan of potato salads with relish and they go heavy on the relish so I'm trying to judge around that. I think they have a good ratio of potato to mayo to egg. It's a great consistency where you still get some texture but also that satisfying mouth mush (4/5 if you like relish)5) Mac and Cheese: Very homestyle mac. They didn't seem to do the whole cheese sauce thing rather they drowned the pasta in cheese. So it doesn't have the silkiness of a more traditional mac and cheese but it does have just globs of cheese with every bite. A bit overwhelming and def heavy but tasty. I def couldn't finish the whole portion. (3.75/5)Overall, I enjoyed my meal here. It felt very homey and satisfying. I wouldn't necessarily crave it but if I'm looking for a hearty winter meal this would be perfect..To me, they still have to best Fish around. I love the way they season their Fish, Shrimp, etc....I am not a fan of Scallops, but I actually enjoyed their Fried Scallops. I never have a problem with the food. The wait time to receive your order can be long than usual because of all the orders they take over the phone. I was told my food would be ready in about 15 minutes, but recieved it 55 minutes later. They have to do a better job at time management. I would take off a star for that type of service, but because I enjoy their food so much, I will keep them at 5 star service. We shall see what happens next time..Fried whiting, mac/cheese, candied yams, rice/peas and potato salad are my goto at this seafood/soul food takeout. They cook better than my mama, except their mac/cheese is a little too cheesy (yes, that's a thing). They also make the best peach cobbler that's good enough to eat without ice cream. You know a spot is good when there is ALWAYS a line outside no matter the day/time.My one gripe about many of these soul food joints is they don't make homemade tartar sauce. It's incredibly cheap and easy to do and their patrons would appreciate it over the trashy packets they give. Take my advice and and order pickup at least 15min before arrival so you won't have to wait for your meal. Enjoy picking off the ends of the fried whiting in your taxi ride back home. Finger lickin' good!.The Food Is Delicious The Staff here isn't so inviting I mean yes it's Harlem However you want people to come back and not feel Uncomfortable  And I'm From Harlem Like wtf.I'm always looking for a good soul-food place and I love seafood so this place was just the RIGHT combination in one. I was recommended by this place from a friend and I'm in love. Their food is sooooo good. I always get the same sides mac n cheese and candied yams. However I try different fishes. My favorite is the flounder. Their food never disappoints. It's always fresh, seasoned to perfection. And their cornbread is soooo good too. It's huge, soft and so filling. That alone can full you up. I have nothing bad to say about this place.  Their food taste so comfy. It's like going to visit your grandma from the South for Sunday dinner. Nothing seems fake or processed here at all. I highly recommend this place. I've also ordered from this place via ubereats and the food is still remarkable..Bussin' got it through Uber eats! Fire, only this location is the one to go to. All the other ones ain't it! Order the 4pc catfish/4pcshrimp, Mac and cheese with yams (2sides ).This food is awesome! Lemonade is awesome! I ordered the catfish dinner with sweet potatoes and collard greens! It tastes just like your mama's cooking! The portions are generous! The servers are friendly! #supportblackbusinesses.Let me tell you something!! i will drive the 30min in rush hour new york traffic to get this food. I kid you not, It tasted like everything! The cheesy mac and cheese, the amazing candy yams, and the best catfish ever!!!!!!!!! so good!"
"This place is the real deal, mwen zanmi!  Best griots, great accras des platanos.   Only 15 minute bus ride from last F train stop.  Has to be your next destination dinner!!!  Queens gaining fast on Brooklyn for Haitian!.Came here two weeks ago.And had black rice with beans and Steamed fish.It was so good.The lady in there was nice.I seen this place through the years and here I try best in Haitian food..I usually come here to get a takeout of typical local Haitian meal e.g. Lalo with white rice sos pwa or fritay. They always have delicious Haitian meals, you won't be disappointed!.Food here is decent. I haven't been here for a while so I can't quite speak on service 'now'. My dad used to love this place! I'll check it soon and update my review later..The food was good but they give you way to much rice and not enough meat.  I wanted to buy just griot only and was not allowed.  in had so much rice left over it was ridiculous and my family was looking at me saying where is the meat."
"My goodness, I was transported back to Paris with these delicious puff pastries. Each flavor was fresh and scrumptious. Highly recommend - the perfect small treat that would light up any day!.This shop is not only good for sweets but for long skinny baguettes or special bread as well. I just need to learn how to make bruschetta, croutons or a Vietnamese banh mi to enjoy baguettes more!.The interior of this place is so freaking cute and the desserts are equally as cute!I stopped by around noon on a weekend with a friend, and the worker was very patient and kind. We were both unfamiliar with some of the things they had, so we asked a bunch of questions, and the worker gave us in-depth explanations for each question. I got a passion fruit meringue tart! The tart was $6? Which was reasonable for the size. Overall the tart was really good, but a little too sweet for me, and I wish it was a little more tart to counteract the sweetness. The flavor of the passion fruit really came through however and the texture of the meringue was also really good. My friend said her flavors for the Chou were a little weird, and seemed to enjoy her tarts more than the Chou. I will definitely come back to try their tiramichou and chou next time..It was my sister's birthday and I am across the country but I wanted to get her some sweets. I looked up a couple of dessert shops in the Upper West Side area and Barachou caught my eye because it looked really tasty and I wished I could have them even though I was 2k+ miles away. I called them and a really nice lady picked up. I told her I wanted three choux and 1 tart. I asked which choux she recommended and vanilla and hazelnut were two of the few she said was most popular. I ordered those along with a lemon one. I also ordered the raspberry tart because I skimmed through the reviews and most people recommended this one! I told her these were for someone's birthday and if they do anything for birthdays like writing on the box. She said she can include a candle in the box which was great!! I made the order and paid for the goodies on the phone and told my sister to pick them up. My sister picked them up and they said happy bday to her and wrote ""Happy birthday"" with a heart on the bag. That was very nice of them. Most importantly, she loved the desserts!I'm very glad I went with Barachou for desserts for my sister's bday. I will for sure visit when I'm back in NYC!.Omg SO cute and SO goodWhen the person at the counter spoke with a French accent I had a feeling this place could be really good and they did NOT disappoint.I went to levain bakery after this and thought -- if I had to choose between the two -- I would come back Here. There are a ton of options for their chous-- I regret not trying them all. I will be returning promptly before I leave NYC..They have a location downtown!!! Not sure why they don't have a page on Yelp. Regardless love the choux here. They're so cute and small yet delicious. Theyre also very elegant looking. The variety of flavors makes it a fun visit each time as well. Love the hazelnut and Praline..Cute and bite-sized. Subtle flavors for the cream puffs. A bit overpriced, in my opinion. Bought 3 for $9. Tarlette was just okay - sweet, tart, and creamy..If we are craving for choux, Barachou is definitely one of our new to-go places in NYC. The decor is exquisite and adorable with dreamy pink colors. There are 8 different options of choux and we got 6 of them in a box. Our favorite flavors were the vanilla and the hazelnut. Their filling is delicate, light and not too sweet. The size is perfect for one or two bites so we can have more than 1 choux without guilt to have too much dessert..Delicious cream puffs.So many flavors to choose from.Dulce de leche is my favorite so far.Would definitely go back to try other desserts..Barachou's pink little Fench shop's claim to fame is their amazing cream puffs with delicious flavored fillings, but each time I go end up get their Tartlets, they just look so good and have the taste match.For gift-giving or just because you may want to sample all the flavors, they have a rectangular box that holds 6 and 12 cream puffs.They also have little chouquettes and macarons here too.  My only complaint is they close at 6 PM, so many times I have missed out because I work in midtown."
"I'm pretty new to this neighborhood so I'm exploring this area! This place it's in front of my apartment so I decide to give them a chance! And I haven't regret yet! It's my third times in this place and I'm stuck with shrimp and broccoli! The broccoli are a little bit crunchy and the shrimps are tasty! Everything comes with soft white rice that balance the savory of this dish.Very fast service and huge portion! They do delivery and take pick up order. Not sure about credit card, but with less than 10$ you can basically order everything in the menu!.I ordered shrimp fried rice, fried jumbo shrimp and green plantains.   Not my usual but it was that kind of week.  I should have gone with my first instinct to go to popeyes.   The ""jumbo"" shrimp were splayed open like discs and now I know why.  The shrimps were not very large or fresh and way way way over battered as in raw dough.  Disgusting.  Next, the green plantains would have been alright had the oil they were fried in been even close to fresh.  Strike 2.  Lastly, the shrimp fried rice only had onions, some sprouts and, you guessed it, bad shrimp that had a slimy texture.   I never went there regularly but they have been going down hill fast.  Everything is nasty and old.  Last time I go here and I would advise you to skip it altogether,  they should sell their garbage in their neighborhood, not mine."
"I've been coming here for the pass 2 years. French toast has become my home. There food is great from breakfast all the way to dinner. The owners are Beautiful Dominican family that makes the food. And they treat you like family they invite you in as one of there own..This place is the TRUTH! I've been going here since I was a child for over 20 years and even though I no longer live in the Bronx, I make it my business to buy breakfast from French Toast every time I visit my mother in the area (she still lives on East 169th street). I always buy the mangu or French toast here. Those are the only two breakfast items I purchase.The mangu is sooooooo delicious! Perfectly creamy texture and absolutely filling! Usually I always have some leftover and don't get hungry for at least 5 hours after I eat mangu for breakfast.My only complaint is that one time I went here at 7 am on a Saturday morning in October 2019 and I thought they would be opened but they were still closed and they didn't open until 8 am. I kept calling the restaurant around 7:15 am and got no answer. The hours say 7 am-8 pm Mon-Sun on Google so that may need to be changed by the owner.But other than that, this is my favorite breakfast spot in the Bronx!.Since I live close by, I gave them about 4 tried and each time they have disappointed.They have ignored me every single time I'm there and once had me waiting 30 mins for a simple bacon egg and cheese while people who came after me and ordered bigger meals were served first. (No they did not call ahead, I was standing there while they placed and made the order). It wasn't until I said ""Hellloooo?"" After waiting more than half an hour where they finally started making my breakfast.  The last 2 times were to deliver over the phone and each and everytime, I get two words in and then she puts me on hold until I get frustrated and hang up... I don't know how these people are still in business. What a disgrace..They sent me what looked to be 3 day old fried cheese and salami. Mangu that wasn't properly cooked. And burnt fries. Horrible experience."
"Whenever I am craving for something a little fancy but not too overboard, I tend to go to Harbs. I like certain cakes more than others at Harbs though. I would go for their Queen of Cake and their Fruit Crepe cake if I ever have trouble deciding and want something I know I will enjoy. I love how their cakes are never too sweet and they don't feel super heavy even though it looks like a lot of cream. Their cream is a lot lighter and doesn't feel heavy like a lot of American whipped cream. The cakes with fruits feel lighter because the fruits adds a freshness to it. I love that the fruit crepe cake has multiple fruits layered in between, but unless you are allergic to specific fruits or dislike certain fruits, I definitely can see myself ordering it a lot. I also really love their Queen of Cake. I haven't tried their other strawberry cake because when I had the Queen of cake, I enjoyed it so much that I just stuck with it. The cake layers are a super super soft sponge cake and it feels light and airy. The strawberries were never tart whenever I had the cake and I had it a few times already. The cream is also very light and airy so having a whole slice doesn't make you feel heavy even though each bite almost feels decadent but in a good way.Their banana cream pie is pretty good too but I am not the biggest banana fan, so with that said, I think it's still a tasty cake. I had their pear mille feuille which I thought was ok, but it was bit soggy since it felt a cake version of a cream puff and usually choux pastry gets soggy if it for a while. I haven't tried their savory foods so I can't tell how that is. As for their tea, I LOVE their white grape jasmine tea. It's floral and fruity and a little sweet since they use real grapes and it just creates such a nice aromatic tea. I don't love the hojicha caramel, but I think because I like hojicha on it's own, I find the caramel notes a bit too much for me. I've tried dine in and takeout from here and I've had a good experience from both services. I do like that when I did dine in back then the waiters were never always in my face, especially when I was dining alone. I felt like I had a lot of space to myself and never felt rushed. I have came with a friend before and she forgot about a cake she ordered before leaving and they were nice enough to make sure she was able to pick up a new slice another day. I also like that when you get the cakes to go, they ask if you are traveling with it so they can put ice packs with the cake. Overall, if I am ever unsure about where I want to grab some dessert from, Harbs is a safe choice. I also like that they do occasionally change out their cakes so you definitely  can try new things out, but at the same time, they also have their staples..1. Their cake has nothing special in terms of flavor and material. With this price, doesn't worth trying. You could get much better cake at any other similar price bakery in NYC. Not sure where their reputation comes from.2. Their staff are not professional, first their dispaly fridge is consistently empty, customer don't know what cakes are available vs. not. Second, three staffs all crowd at cashier and their duties are  messed up. Sometimes the cashier go to wrap the cake, sometimes check the waitlist, when there's an actual staff to wrap the cake or take care of the waitlist. Bad customer experience.3. I ordered 2 cakes in one box and upon opening there's only one. The cashier didn't even apologize and just said oh your cake went to another person's order. Will not visit again and don't recommend..First time trying their lunch special. You have the option to select sandwich ($25 set) or pasta ($28). Both sets come with coffee or English breakfast tea and a thin slice of today's cake (it's thinner than the usual portion). It was a good deal. Except the service was slow, we waited for about 25 minutes for for our first dish. I spotted their kitchen and they seemed a bit understaff.I wouldn't mind going back again. But I would need to adjust my expectation in the timing..The cakes are as good as the ones you can get in Japan! Theyre perfectly sweet and not too heavy. I got the tiramisu and there was more cream than the actual cake part, but it wasn't too overwhelmingly heavy. We also got the blueberry mille crepe. I enjoyed this mille crepe more than other places, but there was too much cream cheese for me personally. The cakes were nice and delicate, but I'm not sure if I would pay more than $10 for a slice of cake again. Definitely a delicacy. The service was ok, and the bathrooms were insanely clean!Overall, I would recommend if someone wanted a cake that wasn't too heavy/ sweet. It's definitely a nice treat for a special occasion..Oh man, I usually do not give five stars for most places, but this place is amazing. They are known for their assortment of cakes, but in particular, my favorite is the strawberry shortcake.  I grabbed it to go to meet with a friend and eat it outside bc the weather was particularly nice that day but also we were still a little hesitant to eat indoors as it was PACKED. Strawberry Shortcake:PROS- nice fluffy perfect genoise sponge- good balance between cream and cake- NOT TOO SWEET YAY!- good amount of strawberries!CONS:- hard to eat outside LOL, esp with no silverware but we made do!Would I come here again? Hands down yes, 100%. I want to try their mille crepe and supposedly their cheesecake is super good too!  I would recommend coming earlier in the day though as some items tend to sell out quick.  They have a separate wait list for sit-in and then there is the counter which is for takeout.  In addition, they do prep the boxes for an extended time if you are unable to eat your cake within a set amount of time. (Eg if you are going to be walking around SoHo for 4-5hrs with your cake)..After first visiting Harbs in the summer, my friend highly recommended that I try it out with her. I entertained her request by making the trip to Harbs early Saturday afternoon to dine in. She got the Mille crepe cake and hojucha, while I chose the queen of cake and a latte. There was a 15 min wait before being seated, but thankfully there was seating near the front of the store. My cake had freshly sweet strawberries and the cake itself was infused with strawberry flavor. However, I though the amount of whipped cream was slightly excessive and I had one sour bite of cake near the end. My friend thoroughly enjoyed her crepe cake except for a single sour bite of kiwi. She particularly appreciated the presence of an assortment of fruit between the layers, as other dessert places often only have crepe layers, which can get boring. I thought my latte was good, but my friend thought the milk content was too high and I was disappointed by the lack of latte art. The bathrooms were very interesting and although there were only two individual bathrooms available, they had the fancy high-tech toilets with buttons for different functions. I would definitely return to try the other cakes on the menu and even possibly the food options! I admit that the cake was a bit pricey though, with a single slice of cake setting you back over $10..I'm sorry what?  How is HARBS not only a chain bakery but seemingly a successful one as it's always busy whenever I passed by.  I decided to finally stop by and honestly I wish I hadn't...where do I begin? Here's some points-1. The service- I'm sorry but it does not take 15- yes, 15 minutes to cut two slices of cake that are right in front of you.  One employee was taking orders and the other was (supposed to be) getting the orders ready.  Instead, she was on the phone the whole time until I asked her if my order was ready- to which I did not receive any apology for the delay.  Not great at all.2. Strawberry Shortcake- the pictures really hyped up my expectations for this cake. Well, as the old adage goes- expectations ruin everything.  First off, the strawberries were extremely sour. I thought I just had a bad strawberry but no- they are all sour.  I'm sorry, no good excuse for this- just eat a strawberry (or a couple lol) from the same batch that would be used to make the cake- pretty sure that's just common sense.  On top of that, the sponge cake itself lacked any flavor whatsoever as did the frosting.3. Milles crepes- just like the strawberry shortcake,  I was really disappointed, maybe even more so as none of the fruit in the cake tasted fresh.  Yes bananas spoil very quickly, but that's not an excuse for the bananas in the cake slice to literally be brown.  Then I thought hey at least the crepes would somewhat compensate for it yet I was wrong again.  I was expected something akin to Lady M and instead I got a crepe that tasted (and looked) like it was made out of pancake batter.  All in all, HARBS was a major letdown for me and my I definitely won't return again, especially at the ludicrous prices they charge for such mediocre cakes..HARBS Soho Ratings: 4/5Food: 4.25/5 - We arrived pretty late, like an hour before they close. I heard many great things about HARBS, but after trying their cake, I thought this place was overhyped a little bit. I got the Berry Berry Cake, one of the few cakes left that night, since others were all sold out. The cake has two layers of chocolate chiffon cake and was decorated with three types of berries. The cream was light, fluffy, and delicious, literally like whipped cream and not too sweet. Both layers of cake were packed with cream and stuffed with fresh strawberry, blueberry, and raspberry. The chiffon cake was spongy, bouncy, with an amazing texture to it, and not dense at all. I think the best thing about it was how light and airy it was, definitely able to finish the cake all by yourself. Overall, a solid cake and each bite was pretty phenomenal, but I wouldn't say it's worth the long wait. Ambiance: 4/5 - This dessert place is located in SOHO, but they have another location in Chelsea too. The interior is very clean and bright. The furniture and decorations were very classy and cute, a perfect spot for afternoon tea or brunch and for you to take lots of Instagram pictures. I like the simple white and yellow colors too. It was pack with customers when we walked in and the staffs walking in and out of the kitchen, but surprisingly it wasn't loud at all. Perfect date spot for desserts. Price: 3.5/5 - The berry berry cake was $12.00 before tax and tips. I think it came up to almost $14 at the end. It was a standard slice of cake, regular portion, and nothing too extravagant or extraordinary about it. I thought the price was too expensive for it. There's a lot more better and unique desserts in NYC at a cheaper price. Service: 4.25/5 - The staffs are polite and nice, greeted my sister and I as soon as we walk into the store. I asked for some recommendations and the staff was very patience at explaining each cake to us. The service was efficient too. I love the fact that they put in a good amount of effort packing the cake into the yellow box. Definitely took the extra steps to make sure the overall quality is there. BLUF: I am not a huge sweet person, but these freshly-made cakes has a good balance of creaminess and richness, but not too sweet. My guilty pleasure treat! I enjoyed it a lot. I think this place is slightly overhyped, but will return one day again to try their mille crepe cake and the strawberry shortcake..I'm going to start off by saying it took them 25+ min to hand me a slice of premade cake after ordering.Ok now that that is out of the way, we got the strawberry cake, which was fine, it tastes like any Paris baguette or Tous Les jours cake but with an $8 markup. I wouldn't come back.Really bad services. The HARBS in Chelsea is pretty good. But this one is horrible!!!!"
"I gave up with NYC Pakistani restaurant until I came across Indo Pak Halal Restaurant. Had simple daal and peas & carrot subzi. Glad I tried to give it one more shot today and discovered the hidden gem. The restaurant is complete mom pop style yet outstanding delicious food. Will return 200%!.I called back after being disappointed in the palak paneer. It smelled spoiled and tasted sour. The guy said I could get other food to replace it. I said no thank you, because; the rice was flavorless and burnt. Also i only got 1 type of sauce and it was bad too. I asked if i I would be able to return the food so they could see for themselves and pick up the refund $17 total. Not including the delivery tip ofc. He started yelling at me and telling me I cant do that because they were closing. (They still had about 50 min before closing) But come on. this guys reaction is yelling at me over the phone, not even letting me talk. And so i wrote this review..This is the worst food I've ever had. The meat was full of bones, oily, and rancid. It was inedible. The sides were microwaved and probably safe, but the sight of the rancid orange tikka made me lose my appetite. I don't understand how this place could possibly have good reviews. Please, please do not order..The food is suuuuuper yummy. Ordered takeout. We got the aloo paratha, lamb bhuna with naan, and seekh kabab with chapati. Everything we ordered was made fresh. I think the key to eating at a place like this is - order something that needs to be made fresh, not what's in the case up front  Also really great, courteous people, great service..Food was flavorful enough but rather oily. Service was okay--the store feels chaotic and the menu is difficult for first time customers. Not sure I'd go back. Garlic naan was amazing, however..The food was just ok (three stars), but they messed up my order. I was supposed to get naan and bread with my order. Either the naan was awful, or they forgot it and charged me for it..Friendly staff, delicious food, big portions, good price at this counter service establishment.I have been here many times for pick up. I get a veggie combo (with roti) and a mango lassi. It is always great.During normal times I like to join and eat inside.During covid also has a few tables outside..An extra-star for customer satisfaction that isn't always present in NYC establishments. The owner-man from Pakistan was kind. I had the Seek Chicken with rice. I asked for some of the lamb gravy and he was kind and generous, adding several dollops of rich goodness over my vegetable biryani. And on top went sliced pieces of 2 large chicken kebobs, spiced mildly. I also added a veg samosa on the side which was not especially memorable but the yogurt sauce that came with it certainly was! I also had two of the small, green chili peppers with my meal. I ate at the tables set right outside, due to covid regulations. Left sweating bullets from the spice and heat, just how I like! Will be back again!.Absolutely horrible experience... please do not waste your money and time on this one. I don't think words will describe how bad it was, I wish I could send it back and watch cook to eat it please do yourself a favor DO NOT order anything from this restaurant.worst chicken tikka masala ever. stay home and make your own food. there is better indian food out there. why did it taste spicy, rancid and like garbage? the owner called me and had the rudest manners. he said that people order this everyday but the real question is - do they ever return back to your restaurant? no. i told him i would be more than happy to dig through my trash to give him back the uneaten food. make yourself a pb and j. the food is not worth it. don't order."
"I have been here twice for the Buy One Sundae and get a Second One Free on Wednesday afternoons.Two staff usually at the Subway station for it gets busier there than at the Carvel section.One staff will walk over to assist, once they see you waiting for Carvel Ice Cream.Staff will ask if you want whip cream, cherry on top and which dressing fudge or caramel. I say I want it all. Have not purchased nor tried the cakes here so I really can not make a comment about them..I bought a large and my Girlfriend got a medium and the cups were soooooo small, like I could go to one in Brooklyn and the cups would be 3 times the size for the same price........ But if you like small cups than this is the place for you.This was a random Wednesday for sundae. Took adv of the buy one get one bogo free soft serve sundae. The ad shows clearly you get one topping, but none was allowed. Also, the address of this place is incorrect. The correct address according to google is 86-51 Broadway, Elmhurst, NY 11373. Despite the experience, I recommend to give this place a second chance as ice cream is ice cream.ZERO STARS! I wish there was a selection for ZERO STARS. Please avoid at all cost. Seriously!I was in the area & had an unbelievable craving for some ice cream. I saw this Carvel was fairly close & despite their reviews I figured I'd give them a chance. No harm, right? I mean how can you botch already made ice cream right? Well, let me just tell you... before I could even have my order taken things didn't seem like they'd go well. A lady in front of me asked for a specific item off the menu (it was printed clear as day on the menu WITH A PICTURE) however the workers continued to look at her like she was speaking another language. It was about 5x after she asked for this item they proceed to tell her they do not have bananas (the main ingredient in her item). Now another worker approaches me & takes my order only to flip over to the Subway side of the store. The employee says nothing leaving the already busy worker to take my order once he was done with what he was already doing. The item I had ordered had two main ingredients chocolate & peanut butter. He proceeded to make my order (his back is toward me & I can't see what he is making). I bring to his attention I believe he is making the wrong thing. He then tells me after my order is complete they don't have one of the main ingredients.Now my issue isn't on not having the ingredients, but the service. If I order something it's because I want it. So tell me before you even begin making it whether you have the ingredients or not. Know your product, know what comes with each item. Last but not least if you are going to work on service & hospitality industry have some sense of how to speak to people. I would not recommend nor will I go back. Even if I had the craziest crazing for ice cream; as I did. P.S. I left without ice cream..Disappointing  to say the very least . I haven't had Carvel ice cream cake since I was a youngster and remember it being such a treat that I wanted my  Son to have one on his birthday. ""Mom where are the crunches you told me about""?.I wish I could give this location zero stars. This does not taste like a Carvel cake is supposed to. There was minimal ice cream and almost non-existent crunchies. Why should I waste my money on an overpriced ""ice cream cake"" when I could have well just gotten 2 pints of ice cream? To top that, I'm not sure how you can get away with that kind of cake writing. I recently had another Carvel cake from a store in Long island and it was fine so I know it's not Carvel as a whole. It's just this Elmhurst location. Horrible experience and will advise people to stay away..Worst ice cream I've ever had in my life.Can't get the reason why this kind ice cream still exist.I had two flavors, and they were all too nasty too give a second try, I threw away all the ice cream, and wished the cone couldn't be too wrong.Naive.Worst cone I've ever tried. I would never step into this store again.Clearly subway is the focus here, right near the train, as no one one wanted to help me even after asking. They only had one flavor -- chocolate -- not even vanilla/twist, let alone a special flavor..My friend and I came here to buy ice cream, first off there was no worker at the carvel counter. We had to ask the subway worker to help us and had to wait. Secondly the ice cream we got was stale, had freezer burn and was full of ice droplets. We told the employee who insisted that she could not refund our money and then offered us soft serve. Don't come here for ice cream..Should have checked Yelp before I came here...They only have 9 flavors available (not including Cookie Dough). When I asked for it, they were going to mix soft serve vanilla with the topping in front of me. So I asked for a soft serve twist, and the server hands me a cone with half melted dollop of ice cream, expecting that I would just take it. Combine this with the fact that the Carvel shares a small store with a Subway, and the smell of tuna is widespread. Sundae: asked for chocolate sprinkles, got rainbow. Asked for fudge, got caramel. Milkshake: vanilla flavored milk. Ice cream: not good.I can't fathom why Carvel hasn't revoked their franchise. Go somewhere else."
"Strolled along Broadway with my son and had a sudden urge to eat Subway. I started off by Elmhurst Hospital but the Subway there was so dirty. We were on our way to Target and came across this one right by the Grand Ave station. I ordered the Thursday Special, $3.50 BMT. I accidentally asked for the multi grain flatbread. I thought it was the multi grain hoagie but didn't pay attention. It looked super small and unappetizing at first but after the lady added all of my toppings and rolled it up, it was surprisingly decent. There's a few tables, it's much bigger than the one near the ER and this Subway is relatively clean and quiet when I went. It's just a little disappointing that there are no longer $5 foot longs..This is the worst subway.  The manager screwed up my order which I placed through DoorDash. I called the subway and told them. She told me to come pick it up.  I told her I can't I have a 10 month old and a mil with a fractured ankle.  To which she replied that's not my problem and proceeded to hang up on me.  I called again to ask why is she bring rude when she's the one who messed up the order I was told by the lady who says she's a manager and refused to give us her name  she told me "" go to hell "" and hung up again.   The staff is very rude and unprofessional. Don't know how to speak to people or even get their orders right..Don't go here ! The staffs are very rude. I walked inside the store and order a sandwich and wanted to use the rewards coupon which is expire tomorrow 10/12/19, they refused and told me can not cancel the order , I ended up paying the food, and then they said something I do not understood. This is my first time write a review!I would never ever come here again! Disgusting! Give one star just to get it posted!.Came here on a Sunday night to redeem a myway reward.  The guy working told me the store doesn't participate but he gave me it anyway. I appreciated the action but his attitude was terrible. After he walked away, I went to ""redeem"" the reward on my phone to make sure this was a participating store. The reward went through and let me check out. The most appalling thing to me was the way he said 'we don't do that here'. It looked like he didn't know how to redeem the award when I showed it to him. Instead of trying to help, he dismissed me with a condescending look like I was a vulture preying on his store, trying to run him out of business. It would be different if this was a mom and pops store but but this store is part of a national chain. There are expectations. You are representing a corporate chain. Turning customers away because you don't know how to process a transaction is unprofessional and hurts the chain's business as a whole..Don't go here. The service is horrible.  They do not want to give you all the vegetables on the sandwiches. I went in this bad store to buy a sandwich.  The employee made steak sandwich and when it came time to add the toppings he said that I could not add the toppings I wanted.  I told him that subway allows whatever mix of toppings you want and he refused and wanted to charge extra for the toppings. He told me he refused and that he does not have to give toppings even though subway corporate says that he must even if franchised.  I then told him to F off and keep the sandwich because I would not pay for his lies and left.  Skip this place..Horrible. The only positive is the convenient location. The staff projects an aura of not caring. When I bring in coupons, they inspect it like I have a fake ID and I am trying to purchase beer. I have met only one pleasant employee ( a young guy with glasses) there. In early January, I wanted to use  a $5.99 coupon and the staff gave me attitude stating they do not accept coupons since Subway was having  the select $4.99 foot long deal. However, the wk before they took the $5.99 foot long coupon even when the $4.99 select foot long special began already.  In March, I decided to go back. There must have been a food shortage since I ordered a meatball foot long and they only gave me 1 1/2 tomatoes, 1 1/2 rings of pepper and 1 1/2 pieces of cheese. Then when I wanted spinach on the sandwich, the counterman mumbled you do not need it. Will I go there again? Only as a last resort when I have craving for a Subway Sandwich. My opinion is go to the Subway on 95-58 Queens Blvd, Rego Park, NY instead. People are courteous and professional there..They gave me ""old dry hard "" bread instead of fresh ones. I thought subway has fresh baked bread.Stay away from this Subways at all costs.. You think that all franchises should have similar quality in food. You understand it's not delicious but familiar and fairly cheap so when you're waiting for someone or just super hungry.. You go, ""why not?"" and buy something cheap to take a seat. PLEASE DO NOT BE MISTAKEN and come here! There are many other more reasonable places you can sit in the area like Starbucks or.. Kulu.Okay, well I decided to come here on a Monday night because I was waiting for my boyfriend who was approximately 20 minutes away. Back in high school, I would always order the broccoli cheddar soup and when I saw the Subways sign, I was immediately drawn to go in and pay for a cheap soup while having a place to wait. First note: Homeless people stay here.. during business hours.. with nothing in front of them. I walk in and ask for the soup, he then asks me what sandwich I want. In which I kindly replied.. no sandwich please, but he was persistent for around 5 minutes which I didn't like. I paid for my food. The receipt he gave me was terribly printed.. could not see anything on it. The soup itself was sooo bad, I could not even begin to describe how disappointed I was. He gave me a try that was all wet, the cracker packaging was sticky and the crackers itself were stale. I would not be surprised if the soup was expired.. it was altogether a disgusting experience..Horrible service. Horrible food. Do not go to this Subway's. Their vegetables are not fresh and they give so little of everything. It's overpriced trash. I asked for an Italian herb and cheese and they gave me an Italian so I corrected them and they took the meat out of the Italian and put it back to be used again later. Yikes. Would not recommend. There's better Subway's. The Subway at Union Square is so much better..This subways the worst everytime I go inside there tyred to make a I purchase the machine doesn't work for you to use the app also try to do a order online to the same store it doesn't let you what's the purpose of using the app if you don't allow you to use it how else you get your food if you don't have any cash only rely on the apps you have also I was lucky I have my wife with me who made my purchase felt very embarrassed that this store always have their machine broken or not working for online orders this is the first Subway and only Subway that has this issue enuff said"
"Smoothies and fresh juices on a Sunday?! Thank goodness, we (I) needed this in the neighborhood! The establishment is very clean, the owner? Very pleasant and full of wonderful essence. I really enjoyed the spinach patty, soft with a minor crispy crust and great flavor. The fresh pressed juice was refreshing of course! You can never go wrong with cucumber. I look forward to returning and trying other things on there menu.The service is great. The vibe is amazing. The smoothies are delicious. The lobster rolls are yummy too.  I love the juices & can't wait to try the jerk chicken wrap!"
"I was here with my wife and kids long time ago because a collegue of mine had recommended me that place as really good to have a fish. Unfortunately they totally did not meet my expectations. Inspite of that fish looked so attractive and nice, it was dry and tough like a resin. I can't imagine how could they spoil that food. May be they gave me old one which was cooked a week ago and then reheated several times? Anyway this is not a spot to go with a family. The only chance to enjoy that food is probably to get drunk and swallow everything what is given. I usually don't like to leave a bad comment and hope that such episodes will be forgotten but suddenly this shitty feeling when I first time have tried that fish came out of my memory and I have decided to write my review. Hope it will help someone."
"My homie Jando introduced me to the xianbing aka the Chinese version of a stromboli (or is the stromboli the Italian version of a xianbing -- oohhhhhh). The filling danced on your tongue. The flaky pastry crumbled all over my newly washed shirt. Grease lined my mouth like I did some nasty things.Fam, I don't know exactly, but I do know that if I lived in the Queen's Chinatown, I...1) Could at least feel comfortable with how much I save with food.2) Know that Tianjin Xianbing serves fresh, hot food on the reg, so no worries about poor quality.3) Understand that I'm supporting a super nice person. (Shout out to the owner/ cashier.)I'll holla at you again, Tianjin Xianbing..Hard to believe that this was probably my first ever Xianbing (meat pie). My boyfriend and I got a beef one each, and ate them right there on the street next to the stall. Felt like we were in Asia again!My noob/clumsy self wasn't aware of all the oil inside the xianbing soo I kinda got it all over my hair/shirt/hands... oops. Similar to soup dumplings, you have to be very careful when eating or else liquids will be flying everywhere. If the xianbing wasn't so wonderfully delicious, I would've been so pissed. But the mess was worth it, and hopefully I'll be better next time. I had originally wanted the beef scallion pancake (rolled up) from here, but there was a bit of a language barrier (we speak Canto, not Mando smh) and ended up with the beef xianbings instead. Again, not mad since they turned out to be sooo good but will have to try again next time..Hole in the wall dumpling spot!!! Located in the basement of a food heaven. Tianjin reminds me of the authentic Chinese dumpling that you can't get anywhere in the states. The dumplings are made so fresh and good that it reminds you a piece of your heritage. This place is obviously cash only. Cheap! We ordered 35+ dumplings for under $25. The lady/owner told us to try the seabass/fish dumpling. I've never had fish dumpling before and neither have my friends. Trust me, you have to get the fish dumplings! We all agreed that it was so different, good, soft and amazing! Tianjin is the place I would most definitely show and/or recommend to my friends when visiting flushing!.For the upper level of the Golden Mall, Tianjin Xianbing (天津餡餅) is for many folks, the first stop for folks on the go. They've been around a decent number of years at this point, I'm always so surprised when folks are discovering them for the first time. Here's hoping that my review will make a difference for future patrons since they are truly the real deal.The aroma during the daytime is hard to avoid, especially from the street. Lined up in the window is almost always an array of freshly baked goods, which will likely include a stack of what they are known for: xianbing (餡餅). It a super savory snack on the go and comes in a variety (lamb, beef, vegetarian, etc.) that is affordable and delicious.I'm also a fan of their scallion pancake rolls (蔥油餅捲) where one can stuff in bits of other meat and is absolutely delicious. For those who go inside, there are a number of hot foods ranging fro hot noodles, sauteed veggies, and fried foods. I've only partaken during lunch time, I can't vouch for dinner time.The service is always good. I'm really impressed with how bilingual (read:  the ability to speak in English and make recommendations based on palates and request. Just remember that this place is cash only and parking is limited to the street parking..My new favorite hole-in-the-wall spot! I came here last night to try their pan fried lamb and green squash dumplings and loved the unique flavor of them! The price has gone up to $8 for 12 dumplings but I think it's 100% worth it. I can't wait to come back to try more of their flavors. Oddly enough, the divey-ness of this spot makes the dumplings more comforting and authentic. Oh warning, there are no forks in this little food court!.Just letting y'all know that they are now on kissena blvd.  on left side of street as you are walking away from main st. Sorry, don't have address was just super excited that I found them again..Service: GoodQuantity: GoodCleanliness: FairFood: scallion pancakes wraps $4This is one of the hidden gems in flushing. Located at the corner of 41 road and Main Street. This take-out place is famous for Chinese version of empanada with choice of leek, lamb, or beef, scallion pancakes, pork buns...etc. I ordered a scallions pancakes wraps with veggies and pork rind jelly. I know it sounded weird, but that's what was in the mood. I do recommend to heat up the scallion pancakes first prior adding the two cold dishes. My wrap was a bit cold. All in all, I will return to try others items..It's super fresh and hot. I ordered the pork Xianbing and it's too SALTY. I don't know if it's just an accident or what but probably won't try again..I walked by this place and was feeling like trying them. I ordered two egg/chive buns, and was asking the cashier what's good and he said the beef bun so I got one and finally a scallion pancake. I ate the beef bun the next morning and felt sick all day. The type of yucky feeling you get when you consume bad quality stuff. I don't know what kind of beef and oil they use but I won't come back again..Usually, I wont give comment on Chinese food.But for outstanding foodstand, I will give my supporting efforts by writing reviews for them. TianJin XianBing is awesome.Not only the owner is nice, but also the food is authenticly delicious.I think the dining quality can prevent people from going but I doubt it is dirty.Anyway, it is delicious.For those people who are interested in Chinese food and never be in China, come here, give it a try!"
"I'm not a fan of overcrowded dive bars but with the prices, the quality of drinks, and the great food selection it's hard for me not to like this place. The staff is cool, love the diverse crowd and the music selection is great..Old school Irish Pub in the Lower Chelsea area. If you like a liquid lunch and chase it with food they have a pretty decent lunch. They have alot of good sandwiches and portion sizes are decent.They were out of Stella on tap when I came at 9pm on a Friday - I'm not sure how that happens. It was a crowded pub at night that got progressively more loud as the night went on. I ended up getting a Guinness that was very frothy. Service was decent and ambiance is what you'd expect from a pub.McKenna's is easily one of my favorite bars in the city. It's one of those go-to, consistently great spots. If you're familiar with the Manhattan bar scene, then you'll know that this kind of genuine place is super hard to come by and you latch on when you find it.I've come to McKenna's to pregame a night out, have a last drink before heading home, and for an entire night... and day. The bartenders are awesome, the drinks are strong (and there's a lot to choose from), and the food is REALLY good. If you're just looking for a drink (or 5) or you want drinks with the option of a meal, this is definitely a good spot for you.Now, for the vibe. The bar is big and has tons of seating. There are tables and booths throughout, too. One of my favorite things about McKenna's is how they celebrate/decorate for the holidays. Being an Irish bar, they go all out with food and drinks for St. Patty's. It's a can't miss event!I haven't been during covid because I unfortunately haven't been back in the city. They're still open and have added new drink specials like buckets and pitchers. Whenever I'm back, I will definitely make sure to grab a drink and a bite!!.Ok this spot is the tits. Amazing service, amazing ambiance, amazing drinks, amazing beers. I used to come here back when I lived in the west village and came back tonight because of st Patrick's day and remembered why I love it so much. Total New York staple. Highly recommend.So while I haven't been here in about a year, the last time that I popped in for a few beers was exactly like the previous time and the previous time before that and so on.  My usual rationale for popping in  to McKenna's was based on my heading to the now shuttered Highline Ballroom which closed some time in 2019.My standing order in the place is a couple of Bud Lite pints and depending on when you get there a two for one drink special is something to enjoy.  You order a drink and get a poker chip for your next drink, its a sweet deal and now most assuredly based on everyone needing to tighten their belt.  I also always order one of their hamburgers since they just make them so good there.  With this I add cheese or course and like the fries on the side.  It's just a little bit extra but overall is a very affordable addition to the experience.  The staff are cordial enough based on what I've observed.  There are a host of regular patrons to the place and in addition to some tables and booths on the side, there are some games and a pool table in the rear.  They generally play loud disco or house music but I have heard some Rock there on occasion.  Sometimes its a wee too loud but hey its a NYC bar and everyone is looking to let loose after work.  I look forward to returning and meeting friends once more for a very long overdue beverage of the alcoholic kind..Wow, great burger with steak fries for nine bucks!  Dollar extra for cheese, and dollar extra for roasted red peppers.  Came out fast. Cool staff.  It was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, the two other places I had intended to go had stopped serving early.  Decided to check out the menu here, blessing in disguise.  I'll be back!.Loveeeee this bar. Every single time I've been here it's always been fun. Staff is super cool, drinks are strong and the food is good. Best bar to go to during any season..I came to this place on a Monday evening with a friend for some quick eats wasn't crowded at all when you walk in the security will check your ID at the door. We  arrived at 7:40pm  so we just missed the happy hour that stopped at 7pm but that's cool we still got drinks I started off with a rum punch and my friend had a margarita for our first round with drinks were good and strong . For the second round we went with margarita on the rocks for both of us . The drinks also came in nice size cups filled to the top not those flimsy plastic cups that most places give you . Now for the food it was good I got the Mckennas famous grilled cheese which came with bacon , cheddar cheese and tomatoes on rye bread ( I believe it was rye bread ) it also comes with pesto sauce but I chose not to put that on mines but overall it was realllyyy good I got it with a side of onion rings which could have been better I thought they were going to be beer battered onion rings but instead I got frozen food / fast food onion rings. My friend got a cheeseburger and steak fries which he enjoyed as well . The only downfall of this place is even though we were sitting down at a table we had to go to the bar to get our food and drinks when it was ready I don't know  if they were short staffed or if that's how it works here but overall this place was cool I would come back next time I definitely will make it for happy hour ..Definitely not a dive, as google would categorize it but still very fun. Very good liquor selection and decent beers on tap. Prices are pretty reasonable for the city."
"I wandered into this place looking for a lunchtime place to kill time between appointments. I must say, this place turned out to be quite a find. It wasn't due to the ambiance (it's kind of dark and cavernous inside, but seeing crumb build-up between the picnic table slats was a bit icky - I couldn't help but think of all the people who dined there before me and what they ate ). It was the fast, polite service and the amazing food that did it for me. I had the chicken schnitzel with mashed potatoes and the citrus kale salad. I haven't had such tasty schnitzel since Germany (I've had it other places, but this one tasted like it was straight out of *Das Mutterland*) and the mashed potatoes were creamy delicious. Unfortunately, I missed the ""spicy"" part of the spicy citrus salad, so after a few bites of kale, I discovered my mistake and I knew my day would end badly (allergies). I did find out afterward that I can request the kitchen holds the pepper next time I order (which I will definitely do again).I was also very happy to find purse (or jacket) hooks! Not enough places appreciate that some women don't want to put their handbags on the floor or sling it over the backs of their chairs, particularly during these tough times, so a place that thinks of their guests' comfort that way really excels in my book.The place is kid-friendly and large party-friendly with lots of finger food for little eaters. It's also a good place to take a date and cozy up with some drinks and nosh (like a saw two couples do).I parked in a nearby garage so I can't attest to the street parking availability.I think you'll be pleasantly surprised like I was. Go and have yourself a tasty casual meal and have your smartphone ready - you'll need it to place your order and pay (FYI, they do accept cash).I'm looking forward to having more time to kill in the near future as an excuse to visit again!.""0.5""Nothing is wrong with the beer but come on.  Put a little into the customer service people.I understand when restaurants make mistakes or miss an order.  But when you call attention to it, it should be fixed.  And then when it's not fixed you should be apologetic not defensive.  I waited for 40 minutes for a simple beer, well I mean it was a draft, and got a huge attitude.  I didn't curse, I didn't cry, I just asked for the 2nd time.  The bartender acted like I personally insulted her family and turned it around on me: not cool.I make mistakes all of the time.  Own up..I love the inside and outside space. This location has skylights inside and the patio garden of the Smith st location is beautiful (summer).I'm a fave of the contactless order system for both Black Forest locations. Food options are good but limited. However, they have a great cocktail list which can be hard to find at beer inspired places..My food took way too long. I had to ask about my order. No one checked if I was satisfied or needed anything else. Because I sat outside I prepaid for my food and was ignored.  But this experience will be the last time. It's unfortunate but I work really hard for my money. The service and food was unacceptable..I've been to this Black Forest location a few times and it's a nice go-to spot for a easy casual night out. There's beer. The sausages are good. And you can hear your friends talk. The restaurant/bar is quite spacious and they have adapted to scanned toast tab menus as many others have. Solid choice for any night of the week..It is as you would expect a German restaurant to be, very deliberate and solid service with a no nonsense approach. The large pretzel is the size of a small baby, get the small pretzel unless you plan to share. The flourless chocolate cake is an interesting investment of your time in a meal, it requires you to pause to enjoy the sweetness. But the real win is the size of the aperol spritz....baby for $12, they understand the assignment.  Large glass and deliciously refreshing, they win..Came here with a group of friends after a night out. It was a Sunday night, and apparently the kitchen closes pretty early so we only had minutes to make our order.  We were seated at a long table, and they actually expanded the table separators a little bit to allow us to be more comfortable.  I think there was one other table present across the restaurant.  So you scan for the menu, and then order your food from your phone.  You pay immediately too which I really liked.  No last minute scrambling.  I had the pork schnitzel and a gluhwein.  The schnitzel was huge and absolutely delicious.  I paid extra for ""wine-brined"" sauerkraut.  I wouldn't recommend, it just tasted like sauerkraut.  The mushroom gravy with the spätzle was a nice extra.  We ordered a round of tequila shots and they were kind enough to bring us a couple extra on the house.I'll definitely be back to actually have a minute to go over their menu and try everything else..My partner reserved one of the ""cabins"" for a date night, and felt incredibly embarrassed after doing so because Black Forest was so awful. The ""cabin"" is a plastic hut with a desktop-sized heater (think about 6"" by 3""), which was not on before we got in to the cabin, so it was freezing. The door was wide open and there were already holes in the plastic. Realizing this, the host assured us ""it warms up quick."" It doesn't, and it didn't. The cabins had no light; our only light source was the bodega we found ourselves sitting in front of. We couldn't take off our coats/hats/scarves. We tried to because we had dressed up nicely for the occasion, but that was ultimately a waste. All ordering done online, including tipping. You have to tip upon ordering, which means they don't have to provide really any service whatsoever and still get a tip. You're seated around the corner from the restaurant entirely, and you have to walk to the restaurant bar to pick up your drinks, then walk them past the various pan handlers on the street to get back to your freezing cabin. We did not receive any service--no water, no ""how is the food?"" The server opened the cabin door slightly and handed the dishes over to us and left. We got our food 15 minutes before the 60 minute time limit was up. Almost as soon as we received our food, an employee came by to let us know that they had another reservation coming up in 20 minutes, so we should ""hurry."" By the end of the night, we paid nearly $100 to sit, freezing cold, outside of a bodega in a tent. The subway station was warmer than our cabin. We wished that we had instead just ordered take-out and watched a movie, then put the money towards something far better. There are so many businesses really struggling right now, and it's a shame that this place is overcharging for perhaps the worst NYC restaurant experience I've had, yet stays afloat. Pretty much, buy a couple of bodega sandwiches and a bottle of wine and you'll have a better night than you would if you went to Black Forest..So, when ordering delivery, make sure to express you want all the sides that are supposed to be included in the comments section. Unfortunately, they have become THAT restaurant. Like, I wouldn't think I'd have to ask for mustard or sauerkraut, since it's supposed to be included, but you def do. Currently looking for mustard and disappointed..Wow! We so enjoyed our visit.  You order from your phone.  Everything comes immensely fast.  The waiters were so kind!  The food was phenomenal but the drinks were over the top out of this world (enjoy your beer in a boot).  One of the best meals I've ever enjoyed.  You MUST try the giant pretzel."
"i'm 100% addicted to these cupcakes. so much so i've gotten them delivered to my home 3 times in the past few weeks!! these are show stopping desserts - the right amount of sweet and moist and so many flavors to choose from. can't recommend enough!!.Ever heard of love at first bite? If you go to BKLYN Cake Studio I promise you'll experience what I mean! We were looking for something sweet late one evening and this place didn't pop up on Google when we searched for bakeries near us, but we spotted it as we walked back to the car. The space is tiny; only enough for one person to step in and order/pay. I believe it was the owner who helped us and she was very nice, she patiently answered all of our questions. They get extra credit for being open late; it was around 8pm when we went and I believe they're open until 9pm which is awesome! We chose a Pumpkin Spice Cupcake, Chocolate Cupcake and a slice of Carrot Cake. The Pumpkin Spice Cupcake was absolute PERFECTIONNNN!!! I can't even find the words to properly describe it! It was so delicious and not overly sweet which is rare for me, because I almost always find frosting too sweet and I end up not able to eat all of it. This time it was so good I could have happily eaten a second cupcake with ease! The Carrot Cake was also delicious, it was light and fluffy, not dense like so many carrot cakes tend to be and the frosting had a subtle hint of lemon that was different and delightful. The Chocolate Cupcake was very good as well, although possibly overshadowed by how incredible the pumpkin Spice was. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because this was just my first visit and although I was blown away, I need to try more, which I intend to do very soon!.Janice Is the hardest working cake maker in nyc. Please support this local business . Janice accommodates all of our quirky requests with incredible deliciousness . I'm vegan and gluten free & she makes the best tasteful cake. Even non vegan friends love her recipeMy son always has intricate ideas for his birthday cakes and Janice creates designs that bring his dreams to fruition. She's a talent and treasure.Like the only other review on here, I don't know why it took a pandemic for me to discover how great this place is but I'm glad I finally learned my lesson. While from the outside this place might look a bit like a 'custom cakes only' joint, they actually do have quite a bit to offer for walk in customers -- from slices of cake to cookies to cupcakes to other various rotating options. If the rest of it is as great as the cupcakes then we are all in luck. The cupcakes here are amazing. They have that absolute perfect no nonsense homemade taste, it's the basics done perfect. Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate, lemon, you name it, it is all great. Depending on the day they will have some special flavors, sometimes seasonal sometimes not, and those are just as good as the regular ones. Make it all reasonably priced and with friendly one-super-woman service (you can walk in and order a half dozen cupcakes and she'll frost them on the spot for you) and you got yourself an awesome neighborhood addition. I now obsessive look through the window and pine for these cupcakes whenever I walk past this place. It's a blessing and a curse..Amazing and fresh cupcakes in a sweet storefront on 7th ave. I accidentally found it the first time on my daughters bday which was great luck and made two more visits during the month I spent in the slope.  If there are Oreo available def try them!.Incredibly disappointed  - this owner - refused to hear my thoughts - she never saw the texts sent to me by her employee - always said I was negative - i initially took the bad review after her disparaging texts - but she could care less about a new customer - I have written over 50 reviews - and 90% were positive - this is a place I would never want to do business with - she does not care about the other view point - just my thoughts -Janice - you never have spoken with me - obviously you do not care about clients - no harm no foul - good luck to you - won't ever order again - all my  very best - I removed 4 posts because the businesses closed - please stop spreading lies - had an awful experience with you and no worries - I will stick to MIA's which is always wonderful and at least when items are sold out - they callIf this business owner actually cared about customer service - she would actually try to help - instead she criticizes and trolls - so happy - I now realize Mia's is the very best and will never try anything new - she should learn about actually caring about her clients - instead of  being evilyes I am revising again - if you spent more time - trying to improve customer relations - as opposed to being simply nasty - maybe your business would do betterpromise this is my last revision - I have better things to do - I am in the hospitality business - its obvious you do not want more clienti have not changed in over 5 days  - you really need to let this go - glad you are doing well.We've eaten many birthday cakes (and cookies) from Bklyn Cake Studio over the years and they're always delicious. The birthday cakes also look amazing. We've ordered multiple birthday cakes with different themes/flavors/style and they never disappoint.  Janice, the owner is very easy to work with and gets back to you quickly. She listens to your ideas and she'll make suggestions on how to help create your vision in cake form!.Placed an order online and received a confirmation with the delivery estimate. The order never arrived and I called multiple times with no answer. My card was charged and now I need to pursue an AmEx dispute. Pretty terrible experience..I've only ever ordered from BKLYN but everything I've tried so far has been delicious. The cupcakes, cookies, carrot cake, all great! You can taste the freshness and quality..What a hidden gem! We were actually driving through the neighborhood and stopped to pick up some Vietnamese sandwiches a few doors down. While we were waiting for our order, I noticed this tiny storefront with a sidewalk sign advertising their baked goods. The bakery had a small assortment of cookies, cupcakes, brownies and cake slices. I love baked goods, but I'm always wary of trying new places because so many cupcake places are just not very good (dry with overly sweet frosting) and they're not cheap either. But this place had Snickerdoodle cookies and that's my son's favorite cookie so we had to try it. We got the snickerdoodles, double chocolate, oatmeal with butterscotch, and ginger molasses cookies - all were perfectly chewy and delicious. We also tried a chocolate cake slice which was moist and delicious. We will definitely be back!"
"5 stars+ experience at Cafe Sabarsky. Seriously, one of the more delightful meals I've had and it checks so many boxes. Cafe Sabarsky is located inside the Neue Galerie, a museum dedicated to German and Austrian art. We spent the first half of the afternoon viewing the  Galerie's exhibit and then headed to Cafe Sabarsky for dinner. We scored a last minute reservation thanks to our very generous friend and we were super excited to try proper German food.The first thing we noticed is the ambiance of Cafe Sabarsky. During the evening, it was darkly lit with a beautiful glowing chandelier and small lamps at each table. I loved the dark, rich color scheme. You really feel like you're at a intimate cafe in Vienna!Wanting to try everything, we opted for the beet and goat cheese salad, the pumpkin soup, Bavarian sausage, and the Tyrolean cheese dumpling. For drinks, we tried the espresso martini and for dessert, we opted for the passion fruit and coconut cake at the recommendation of our friend. Everything, and I mean everything, was absolutely delicious. The beet salad was a generous portion, absolutely loaded with beets and fresh goat cheese with a great honey mustard dressing. I'm still thinking about the pumpkin soup though - spicy, nutty, so flavorful. I want to recreate it, but I know it will be pointless. We had a good laugh at the pale Bavarian sausages, but paired with the pretzel and sweeter grainy mustard, it was truly so flavorful and really melted in your mouth. We also loved the cheese dumpling. It was somewhere between an arancini and a ricotta dumpling, so delicious and perfect for a cold evening. Dessert and drinks were also spectacular. The espresso martini was well made and perfectly balanced. The cakes are gorgeous, and the passion fruit cake had this amazing coconut crust that we really enjoyed.Overall, Cafe Sabarsky was such a great meal experience and we enjoyed every second of our meal. Ask yourself when was the last time you had a good German food experience and get yourself a reservation!.I always have a fun experience coming to Cafe Sabarsky. You really feel as if you're in a cafe in Vienna and it's a cool experience walking into the building with the museum, you almost feel like you're in someone's living room. This place is not cheap, so don't think this will be your ""quick and easy lunch"" after spending a day museum hopping. There will likely be a long wait and you'll spend at least $60 on a very small portioned lunch for two (excluding any alcoholic drinks should you get them). That being said, I love dining here. The restaurant is beautiful, the food feels very traditionally Viennese, and their coffee ""kaffee"" is high quality. The smoked salmon ""sandwich"" was around $26 for a very small portion, but flavor was good and presentation was very nice. My boyfriend liked his pretzel and sausage and was satisfied with the amount of food, although I thought the sausage looked like a beluga whale (sorry). This place is really a treat rather than your Sunday brunch go-to spot, but I will definitely be back and am already looking forward to it!.My server Nathan, was very on point. The guy had like at tables at the same time and was killin it. He also recommended and poppy seed cake desert that was gluten free. I didn't have high expectations. This cake- I had an out of body experience. I. Left. My. Body. It was so good. Just go and get the poppy seed cake. Jesus..Loooved the vibe of this cafe. Fancy and warm and cozy and everything in between. Servers were great and attentive. Came right before the breakfast rush on Saturday morning and were seated right away. The doorman inspects your purse and asks for your vaccine card as per routine with almost every NYC restaurant.We had sweet and savory entrees that we shared and pleased with the window's little view of Central Park whilst sipping on Viennese coffee such as the wiener melange. Dishes and service were nothing short of perfect..This place is truly one of the best kept secrets in the upper east side! Located inside the Neue Gallery that houses the famous Klimt's the Lady in Gold painting, this gallery cafe has an elegant/old world charm of Austrian cafes yet not too stuffy. The food is excellent as well! It has a great menu for breakfast, lunch,afternoon coffee, authentic Austrian desserts (sachertortes/strudels) I came by for a early afternoon drink along with some light bites before dinner. The roasted Bavarian sausage I ordered was amazing and paired perfectly with the roasted potatoes. In the spirit of the holiday, it was really nice that they had mulled wine amongst other wine and cocktails. Perfect holiday treat and really quaint place all year round!.Food 3/5 Location 5/5Wait 4/5Staff 4/5I heard that this was the place to go in New York for cakes so I went there with the sole purpose of getting a great New York cheesecake.  Now it may have been that my expectations were too high, but I was rather disappointed by it.  Both the top and bottom of the cheesecake had a regular cake consistency which made it very light and nothing like a cheesecake I was expecting. They are right next to Central Park which is phenomenal and east to get to by subway.  The wait is outside and split by museum or restaurant and ended up being only 15-20 minutes which was not too bad for New York.  The prices were a bit higher than I am use to which coffee being about $10 but that is not unexpected in New York.  Overall, It could be that their other options were better and I just chose the wrong one but I would get one of the other cakes if you plan on going..A dessert destination! It's a surprisingly chic museum Cafe.  The regular food offerings are, unsurprisingly, a bit on the pricey side.  In parituclar with so much competition in the city.  But the ones making the baked goods know their business!  If you want to have access to a delightful array of tasty treats this is the place!.Very high quality German food. A little overpriced but found it to be a worthwhile experience anyway..If you'd like to feel transported through time and space while being in the UES, this is for sure a place worth visiting!The ambience is superb and the service is exceptional. You aren't rushed at all which is great for a place in the city. We easily spent 2 hours here just taking our time.We got the herring sandwich and smoke trout crepes as mains. Both were delicious. The herring sandwich was particularly unique and flavorful.You then have the display of beautiful cakes to pick from. We went with the Sachertorte and Linzertorte. The Sachertorte is rich with a delicious apricot undertone, perfect for chocolate lovers. The Linzertorte was also great and the raspberry jam was very flavorful. The coffee was also great.Overall, great experience and would definitely come back!.Unique cafe within the Neue Gallery.  Wood panelling and very attentive service. Very lovely Austrian menu.  My friend's husband loves coming here whenever he's back in town.  He treks out from Astoria to enjoy the pleasure of dining here.  My friend and I shared the mulled wine (lightweights), bratwurst and one of the warm desserts.  The mulled wine was perfect for the chilly weather on Sunday.  Bratwurst was perfectly grilled and served with delicious sauerkraut and potatoes.  The suprise was the :  Kaiserschmarren mit gerösteten Früchten, 14 Preiselbeeren, getoasteten Mandelsplitter Shredded, Caramalized Crêpes Soufflé, Roasted Fruit Compote & toasted AlmondsAbsolutely a delightful and different desert."
"I ended up here after a visit to the Met - I was starving but I know that the options at the Met and both bad and expensive. This cafe was just a block or two away. Even though it was past prime time for lunch the upstairs cafe was packed with a long line, so I was directed downstairs to this cafe that serves the same menu. You can get drinks, Viennese coffees, desserts and full meals. Things are definitely pricey - cake is $10.50, and schnitzel was around $30.I picked a vegetarian spaetzle filled with carrots, peas and mushrooms - kind of like the insides of a pot pie. Despite the creamy sauce, it wasn't too heavy because the spaetzle was well cooked and not gummy. You'll hear as much if not more German spoken here than English. If you want the authentic Viennese cafe experience, it's pretty close..When the Cafe Sarbasky lines stretch out the door, Cafe Fledermaus has your back. It serves the same menu, albeit the view is not as nice. There are tables for 2-4 in the front and a few sharing tables in the back. The menu ranges from traditional schnitzel/spaetzle dishes to sausages, soups, and sandwiches. Prices are rather high, portions rather small, but the taste is quality. We tried a few bratwurst plates and the goulash soup. The roasted potatoes and fresh mustard that came with were taste highlights. The sausages were tender and flavorful. My favorite was definitely the goulash soup. Rich beef stew with potatoes and some fresh onions - hit the spot. The desserts are all so beautiful and delicious! We tried the chocolate hazelnut cake (feuilletine) and wow. The crunch from the hazelnut bark on top was incredible. Paired perfectly with a coffee.Can't wait to stop by for another cake next time I'm in the area..Cute little cafe downstairs at the Neue Galerie.  Same menu as upstairs but with no wait.  Coffee and Klimttorte (hazelnut-chocolate cake) were great..Too bad! This place gone down the drain. I haven't stop by in a few year and it was sad because it's an Austrian food only on the name. Asparagus-lobster bisque soup tasted like sweet, thin milk with no other flavor, Viennese schnitzel is too thick and famous apple strudel is not what it should be and, fresh and whipped cream seems to be out on the can. Service is also lacking for such high prices! Nobody asked us ones if we were done eating, just gathered plates and left..This little gem was a God-send for three hungry Germans! My brothers and I enjoyed a wonderful meal together here on a sibling trip to the city and we had the best time. We loved our brats and bier, and we had great service. Our grandparents used to own a German restaurant so it was a nostalgic experience for us. Thanks for the great time!.Cafe Fledermaus is a cute Austrian cafe located inside a museum featuring Austrian and German art.  The menu is identical to Cafe Sabarsky (upstairs), minus the Central Park views.  We came on a nice Sunday afternoon, so there was a 15 minute wait (security is a bit strict for a cafe, as they look through your bags and make you throw out water bottles).  We had the chocolate cake (absolutely amazing), chocolate hazelnut cake, and apple strudel.  The desserts reminded me of the ones I had in Vienna..Great environment average food. European vibe is very inviting. Dry sachertorte however is an unforgivable offense..I was exceptionally pleased with my experience at Cafe Fledermaus, downstairs from Cafe Sabarsky. I actually intended to go to Sabarsky, and there were tables available, but the room was bustling with loud, gesturing types, and I just wanted some peace. Luckily, Cafe Fledermaus has the same menu and is rather a chill low-ceilinged room. The tables are also low, not too, low, but it does make for a relaxed and conversational environment.   I had the cheddar-filled bratwurst, which came on a bed of sauerkraut accompanied by dijon mustard and an elegantly stacked pile of potatoes. Everything was absolutely excellent. I also enjoyed their flavored waters.  For dessert, I had the quark cheesecake tart with vanilla sauces. It was so/so..Great spot. More casual than Cafe Sarbosky upstairs but there was no line, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was nice. Good service. We recommend the cucumber juice with sparkling lemonade, the liver wurst sandwich (fairly mild, chunky version), salmon and cream cheese sandwich. For dessert, we had the adele-schnitte (passion fruit and coconut ), the apple strudel , and the Sacher torte. My favorite was the adele-schnitte. Sacher torte delicious and moist,  but rich, as they tend to be..Little expensive, but food is good!  And German!  Wine prices are outrageous.  Sandwiches are around 16 bucks."
"I have been to this location a couple of times. Customer service is consistently good. The prep time for your drinks fluctuates on the time of day and number of people ordering, both in person and online. I recommend ordering through the app and coming to pick up to avoid crowds..Just like so much on Broadway this Starbucks is a while lot of ""extra"" with it's shiny bright lights flickering on it's marquee.Tyical 'bucks menu and coffee offerings. Busy location of course as it's in tourist central. On a cold night it was even busier with many wanting a hot beverage to walk around with and take pictures. All it needs is the Naked Cowboy slinging drinks as a batista. So extra..What you would expect from a typical Starbucks location. Nothing fancy or friendly. Just somewhat efficient in getting you in and out..Love Love Love me  a peppermint latte especially on a beautiful Wednesday afternoon in NYCity Love the Christmas cups. Puts me in the Christmas Spirit!.This Starbucks was right across the street from our hotel in Times Square. This was actually the last weekend of Jan. The store was busy, but not too busy to have waited so long for coffee and hot breakfast. Just ordered a pike, americano, and a sous vide egg bites. Our order times were split. Coffees were 5min apart from one another. And food was 5min later. By then there was no one else waiting for their order except for us. Luckily we weren't in a rush. Seems like they either didn't get out order done it someone else grabbed it. So they still had to make it..Don't sneer at me for reviewing Starbucks. Otherwise it's Sneerbucks.This is the smaller of the three Starbucks that I've been to In Times Square but is the most notable because it has neon lights (and I'm not talking about Demi Lovato) as the sign which is pretty cool and unusual - in fact it's the only one I've seen like that..I went in yesterday to get my latest favorite drink, a salted cream cold foam cold brew. I normally go to the other Starbuck's across from my work because obviously, it's more convenient. Unfortunately, my place was out of my drink. I know now to just order something else and avoid this Starbuck's.Walking in you notice that the store is fairly clean. Music is playing and not too many people waiting for drinks. I ordered my drink and another for a friend. The nest thing that you notice is that the people working behind the counter are extremely loud talking to each other. I was getting really annoyed actually because I was looking at my two drink cups and they were not making them. I waited patiently as I listen to them screaming at each other in a playful manner. (I hope it was playful). But I was getting upset because I was on a break and didn't have time to listen to them shout back and forth.The girl behind the counter says ""are you waiting for something?"" I then pointed to my drink cups and she said ok.Very long story short: I had to have her remake the drink twice because I guy jumped in to make my drink and made it all kinds of wrong. I will definitely make sure that I do not go back to this location. If I want to listen to screaming and get bad coffee I'll go to a nasty coffee shop. At least then they might make my drink faster and undoubtedly it would be better..Laisha was super helpful!!  We needed to buy several gift cards as presents and she kindly helped us look for all the designs we wanted.  She also sold us the last two holiday reusable cups!! Laisha is customer friendly and made our visit to Starbucks in NYC a memorable one.  Thank you again Laisha!.So Starbucks unveiled its Halloween themed drink the Witch's Brew Frappuccino on Oct. 25 and has the drink in stores until Halloween day. The bright purple Frappuccino drink is made of toad's breath, bat warts and lizard scales. ....Well not really.... lolThe ingredients include an orange flavored, purple colored powder for the drink's flavor and color, chia seeds as the bat warts and green sugar as the lizard scales dusted on top of the whipped cream.  It's purple but tastes like oranges... Sort of like an orange creamsicle. The chia seeds gave it a nice crunch. I love holiday themed drinks so I gave it a 8 out of 10. Not too sweet but light & creamy. The downside to the Times Square location is the homeless people sleeping inside. I wanted to sit down as I waited for my Broadway show to start but had to stand outside because there was no room. It's just unacceptable for paying customers..Okay, we all know Times Square is a busy area but this Starbucks deserves some credit. There is almost always a line. The bakery and refrigerated section are always well stocked. In my opinion, they have the most extensive coffee and merchandise selection than any other Starbucks in the city. If you're looking for a special gift or a specific mug, chances are this Starbucks is gonna have it and have more than one. With that being said, this is a grab and go location so don't plan on enjoying your drink there."
"If you love diners as much as I do, then look no further!!!! Golden eagle is your perfect, local, all-American diner with a robust menu catering to any and all of your cravings. Perfect for a small gathering or large groups, there's a table for everyone!!! I came with a group of 14 and we were accommodated right away in a room just off of the main dining area, it was perfect. The service was excellent and although being a large group and in a separate dining area we never felt neglected or forgotten about. I ordered the chicken and avocado wrap, which was rather bland and, well.... We'll leave it at that, but the challah French toast with Nutella looked delicious and was among the favorites ordered today. I'm told the lox platter was great, and although the bagel was plain, the lox was fresh and tasty which made up for it!They deliver too!Note: I'm giving 4 stars not because it's the best food I have ever eaten, but for a local diner, in the Bronx - it's pretty perfect!!.I ordered a veggie burger combo via DoorDash. The order was made & delivered pretty quick & I see why. There was just a veggie patty in between two buns, no lettuce, tomatoes, onions, ketchup...just a dry patty. The waffle fries were super oily & I personally hate when you eat fries & all you taste is oil & salt. First & last time ordering at this place..Didn't expect it but, Golden Eagle Restaurant was really outstanding. Loved the atmosphere, and style of the decor. All of the food items are outstanding, their menu is amazing, I really like their Sliced Turkey Club Sandwich. The workers are very attentive and friendly. They're good at giving recommendations. Highly recommend - we will certainly be back to Golden Eagle Restaurant for more..old school diner in the bronx on morris park ave that gladly is still kicking for locals and visitors . a typical greek american diner serving breakfast. lunch and dinner with the typical diner food menu . place aint big but plenty of booths , tables , counter seating in interior decor style that looks outdated and thats what folks in the area are happy with including me who is visiting for the first time since the mid 90s.  got my booth near the back and now its time to enjoy my silver dollar pancakes with a side of sausages and orange juice . good food , good service and for two folks check was under 40 bucks including tip. old school diner in the bronx on a sunday morning works for me..This was a diner I would go to often a few years back. After moving back to New York I was quite excited to come back to the diner I used to eat at so often. I ordered roasted turkey with mashed potatoes, and my partner ordered mashed potatoes with a side of eggs and bacon. The food was okay, until we got to dessert. I ordered the cheesecake which was good, while my partner opted for the chocolate pudding. The pudding was hard on the outside and extremely lumpy upon sticking your spoon inside. I asked them to take it back. They brought another pudding out for my partner, which was slightly better, then the server proceeds to tell us she had just served us old/expired pudding because she was on vacation and did not know the pudding in the fridge had gone bad. What kind of server tells you they just served you expired food? What kind of restaurant doesn't label their prepared food with dates to prevent this..The food is great here and always fresh. I order lunch here often as my job is nearby. The prices are decent and the service is quick!.Golden Eagle is the definition of no frills - it's been on Morris Park Ave for ages and is definitely one of those go-to places for the locals in the neighborhood. The restaurant is not huge, but still a decent size - it has that classic diner look with booths, a large counter with seating, and TVs playing. I will say it's a little dated - the carpets and booths have that floral print that was popular around 20 or so years ago. They still write out their orders on paper receipts and have that old-school cash register - a real throwback. I usually go simple in diners; I had the turkey club which came with fries and a pickle with cole slaw. The sandwich was good - the bread was toasted and didn't fall apart when I took a bite and was tasty overall.Definitely a good place to go if you want to stay local - the food is decent and the people are friendly - not much more you can ask from a diner..This place sucks.  30 bucks for eggs bacon sausage and bread and still got the order wrong   How ? Over priced for nothing.  Close it down already.I go on Wednesday to have the best minestrone soup ever!Customer service is excellent, everybody is very nice and caring..I've been here numerous of times and I haven't had an issue. Staff are friendly. Food is good, this is a diner so you order your food the way you want to, no biggies. The food portion is enough for 2 ppl, they are big. The bathroom is clean and always has toilet paper!!.I've order from here too many times. Staff is great and never have I had an issue with my orders. I've also dine in here as well and my orders have been on point. The prices and portion are good."
"Hi,Just wondering why no one answers the phone for phone orders? Thank you! Keep up the wonderful boba in brown sugar. You guys have the best boba!.Wow. Drinks are so fresh and I love the new owners! Yao so sweet, kind and friendly!!!! Definitely will be back since the best kung fu tea is at this location. Good luck and keep up with the outstanding work!.So I have the app and I get emails saying oh come in today for free boba, so ill order the drink and there's absolutely no boba in my drink even though it was part of my order. Really annoying! I do love their drinks, I dont feel like theyre always the same and there's a lot of competition around..Let me preface by saying I didn't actually get any teaInstead I asked to have a Thai tea with brown sugar boba and was met with ""we can't do that"". Well can I have milk tea and substitute (pay for) the brown sugar boba? Again, ""we can't do that"" -_- eventually I just let without purchasing anything and went to Moge Tea.Yesterday I came here to get a drink. I ordered an almond milk tea with 30% sugar and NO ice. I made sure to emphasize that I didn't want ice.  When my drink came out I took it and left. I was drinking my drink and got to the bottom and what do you know, there was ice. I was disappointed because I especially emphasized that I did not want ice. The drink itself was good, the service was ehh..I went to the grand opening of this Kung Fu Tea and got a Winter Melon Green Tea and a  Passionfruit Green Tea. I liked the Passionfruit Green Tea better. The service was relatively fast and the staff were friendly. It was very clean and what I expected from a Kung Fu Tea. The second time I dropped by, I downloaded the app and had a $4 reward, so I got a Longan Jujube tea- my new favorite! It is not too sweet and I personally like longans and jujubes, so it was a good combination. The staff was different this time around and one of the employees allowed us to try the classic milk tea because he saw that I was having a difficult time choosing a drink. I also had herbal jelly inside my tea and that was a great addition! This Kung Fu Tea is located with several other stores nearby, so it's a nice part of the neighborhood. Although it is a little bit on the pricy side, I enjoyed my visits!.Finished my order at 5:07, shows pick up at 5:12pm but Didnt get my drink till 5:24pm. After finishing my drink I saw half cup of ice left. Basically I had half a drink and half ice..So I have never been inside this place but came recently during the social distancing take out and I got myself a taro bubble tea, it was delicious I should have ordered a large lol.... so you walk up to the window and place an order and wait outside for them to call your number .. then you get your drink .. pretty simple I overheard them talking about ordering online and you can just go to pick it up which seems even easier so.. next time I will probably order online I am looking forward to checking it out when we are aloud inside .. FYI there is always a line outside ( it moves pretty quick ) but to me that always makes me feel like if there is a line it must be that good !! The reason I chose to stop at this place is because they had some nondairy options not every place that has bubble tea offers non-dairy but this one does!! ...So I have never been inside this place but came recently during the social distancing take out and I got myself a taro bubble tea, it was delicious I should have ordered a large lol.... so you walk up to the window and place an order and wait outside for them to call your number .. then you get your drink .. pretty simple I overheard them talking about ordering online and you can just go to pick it up which seems even easier so.. next time I will probably order online I am looking forward to checking it out when we are aloud inside ..

The reason I chose to stop at this place is because they had some nondairy options not every place that has bubble tea offers non-dairy but this one does.I've been on a bubble tea kick, and so far this kung fu tea location is my favorite.  Never had any issues with my order.  Customer service is friendly & they make my drinks on time.  I tried their new wow bubbles & I'm loving it. It's more chewy and sweet than the regular bubbles..Came in 2020 during pandemic year. Not sure what happend to them, maybe business is too good so no effort into service or quality needed. the boba is suppose to have a subtle sweetness as you chew but their boba now taste like plastic, zero taste. like chewing plain plastic.  oh well.  luckily there are plenty of other options nearby...Didn't think I could get a better quality (texture) boba than Coco's but Kung Fu tea's is noticeably softer and the chewiness is just right.  Also the boba itself is sweeter at Kung Fu. As for the pudding and grass jelly, I still prefer Coco's..The service at the bayside store can do with some improvement. There is a clear bias that is displayed. Most establishments go on a first come first served basis but on more than one occasion I have to wait for my order while others who come in after me get theirs. Th.This review is solely based on the Taro Bubble Tea. If I recall correctly, this drink used to be the color purple not white!!! It didn't even taste like taro!! Do they put maybe a pinch of taro and fill the cup up with milk?? Sooo disappointed. This used to be my favorite drink. Will have to go to other bubble tea locations from now on."
"For the very first time they were fast with their delivery, most time we waited a little over 30 min, this time it was less than 20 min. First thing I thought it was rushed. To my Surprise it tasted great. Not all the time you buy pizza it's good. Only issue I usually have is you have to pay for garlic sauce!! Like come on dominos..THIS IS WHERE CUSTOMER SERVICE GOES TO DIE!! Called this place to order some wings for curbside pickup. I was told by just call when I arrive and someone will bring the wings right to my car. This was great because there is no parking at this location, it was raining and I didn't want to double park and risk getting a ticket. Well that's where the pleasantries end. I gave them ample time, double parked outside and called. A different guy with very nasty attitude picked up and informed me very rudely that he was in fact NOT sending anyone outside, I had to come in. I asked to speak to the manager and he said she's not here. Of course, I'm agitated by the time I walk in and when I ask to speak to the manager, sure enough the guy was a liar. She was right there, with a very bewildered expression on her face. After explaining myself, I was made to understand curbside pickup is only for online orders. Now that's perfectly fine and if it was properly communicated I would have just had them deliver my food ($4.99 fee and drama free). There was no apology for the miscommunication. Instead the manager said ""when he said I'm wasn't here, he meant I'm running around"" which in the food industry means she heard someone asking for her on the phone and decided she did not want to take a complaint. This store has a lack of leadership/experience and their communication skills are poor at best but if they fall this short on something as basic as decent  customer service, ask yourself, should they really be handling your food? I shudder to think of the health code violations that are taking place behind the scenes due to their blatant lack of interest. Stay clear of this place..Worst set of wings with halfway sauce and cold. Store service sucked and I was very disappointed!!.Oh my God, Domino's Pizza was epic. Everything is always so fresh, and the price is right! Every single thing was fresh, flavorful, and extremely tasty. The team was very helpful and service is superb. Anyway, get here and enjoy Domino's Pizza!.If you're in a staticy mood and wanna violate people order from this location , they'll give you mad attitude , fuck up your order a few times , try it out I promise it works!.Don't ever order from here. You'll end up getting stale food that tastes recooked. Not only that but they have a habit of marking your food ""delivered"" 15 mins before it gets there. I guess for their metrics? Last order I literally threw the entire order out it was so overcooked. Then when I called about it, got hung up on. Twice..I ordered first then I seen the reviews, I'm not going to front I got worried for a second because I'm starving right now. If I got sent a pizza looking like any of these pictures there would've been a problem. But the food came and it was really good, cooked perfectly. Good job.Listen this place is the worst. The people that answer the phone when ordering dont know anything about  (special) work. They tend to not have a good idea of their own workplace. This is blunt but the pizza was bad. The crust tasted like a burnt log. The tomato sauce was not present. The pizza even though ordered as a medium was given as a ultra small pizza. The dough rougher than life itself. The cut of the pizza slices given no love. The pizza slice was way too small and not even worthy of being called a pizza slice. I also ordered wings and it was awfully raw and not even pleasant in taste. Im not new to dominos pizza so i know what taste good within the company and this is not that.DO NOT ORDER FROM HEREE!!!!! By far the worst dominos branch in queens. I order pizza from them every Friday, Every time I would get my pizza It would either be cold, the wrong thing or the taste would be horrible, but since it is the closest pizza spot to me, I would have no other choice. However, yesterday was the last straw, I ordered my pizza around 5:30pm, the lady I spoke to charged my card, and told me it would be about 20 minutes. 2 and half hours later, I still did not receive my pizza. After calling the store about 12 times and not getting in contact with anyone, I gave up. I called back today and the lady finally answered and she told me that they just ""cancelled"" my order because they were busy, without any type of warning, after charging my card. I suggest, if you want good quality pizza and service .. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!.90% of the time I order from here, they always forget my dipping sauces. I order from this location often because they're the nearest to my home, but I am not a fan of their quality. I always expect it to be crappy but last night it was unbearable. The cheesy bread was extremely dough-ey, UNEATABLE. The bacon inside was not cooked, UNEATABLE. before I realized how poorly/barely baked it was, I took a bite and threw up 30 minutes later. sadly, that was supposed to be my dinner. Didn't even bother calling them, would've heard the most amazing excuse and bullshit."
"This restaurant-in-the-back bodega serves up some of the best Mexican food I've tried in the area.Sometimes they don't deliver.  Sometimes the kitchen closes early.  But all I can say is that they make excellent burritos and tortas, superb tlacoyos, and very solid salsa verde (pretty sure it's made fresh, as the flavor and texture varies slightly day-to-day).  Green sauce is one of my weaknesses and a lot of places get it wrong.  Make sure to get your tacos fully loaded.It's become one of my go-to spots in the neighborhood and is not to be missed.  The staff is very friendly and their food is served quickly.Plus, you can pick up a few awesome paletas while you're there..OMG, Connie's Deli was actually mind-blowing. You'll leave feeling full with yummy food and wonderful vibes. I genuinely have no words that can possibly describe how outstanding the items that I got were. Bonus that their service is so very good, they are so fast and helpful. I would definitely recommend Connie's Deli to others and will definitely come back in the future..Best shrimp tacos ever!!! They seasoned the shrimp with such flavor!! I love eating here.Pros- delicious food!!Cons- 1. Delivery/pick up can take up to and hour long even if your 2 blocks away2. While ordering over the phone in the middle of your order the lady starts having a conversation with someone else then asks you what were you saying!!!!!!!3. As you're telling the lady the order she is slowlyyyy repeating every word you're saying,. I guess she writes down the whole words your saying instead of just writing abbreviations like a regular normal person would. 4. If they are busy I assume, they will pick up the phone and hang up. You might think it cut off and you try calling again but will notice it was on purpose when they do it again!.This is my favorite Mexican food spot in the BX! Urgh my favorites are the torta de pollo, chicken quesadilla and chicken tacos!.This deli has a great grill in the back of the store serving up fresh, flavorful, traditional Mexican food. It's good and when I say good I mean I wanted to leap over the bar and kiss the cook."
"A quaint coffee shop with lovely customer service.Modern meets folky, a newer hungry ghost in Forte Green, with all of your standard coffee needs. Pastries and goodies are available as well.Plenty of seats inside, and a cute long bench for outdoor seating as well.Cappuccino was delicious. They have milk alternatives of soy and almond. Sit down and enjoy some alternative folk during your morning routine..Wandered in for a quick breakfast coffee and was happy to see that they also have king David breakfast tacos. I picked up the queen bean, pec, and mama's migas tacos to go with a small drip coffee. The tacos, like always, were warm, delicious, and a nice blend of eggs, cheese, and other ingredients wrapped up in a soft flour tortilla. One of my favorite ways to start the day.The coffee was fresh, hot, and stayed warm nicely for my 15 degree weather, 10 minute walk back home.Why only 4 stars? I didn't try anything else on the menu! Hopefully it'll be an easy upgrade in the weeks to come!.Weak coffee, weaker customer service. The chocolate croissant was good, but my coffee was, for lack of a better term, 'dishwater-y,' and the dude behind the counter was a condescending a-hole. Please go anywhere else..Everyone complaining about $3 coffee is extra ridiculous.... The person working was very nice and helpful with making recommendations. The place was clean, and the coffee was very good!  Got a cold and hot coffee, and Madeline cookies which were super soft and fresh !! STOP complaining about the extra dollar for coffee!.Hungry Ghost Coffee is located not too far from Dekalb Market or Fort Greene park.This location is really just for pickup - there's not much space for seating or hanging out. They have some pastries and prepared food along with the whole typical coffee menu. I ordered an iced latte. It was a little more milky than I'm used to, but i enjoyed the flavor of the espresso.Hungry Ghost has stayed open during the day so far during the COVID19 closures!.Great neighborhood coffee shop, come here almost daily. Coffee is always good and consistent..Wonderful staff! Very friendly and courteous.  Amazing Cold brew! During this Pandemic, they have been very kind with discounted coffee for all Healthcare employees.  They donated free coffee to the nearby the Brooklyn Hospital.  Proper mask, gloves and distancing are maintained at all times! Fantastic! Highly recommend..I will need to give credit where credit is due and that place is legit simply based on their incredible customer service. Everyone is really friendly and the place has great energy. It was unbelievable. Service was better than a lot of other places. Everything is good here..Was just looking for a snack and found this place. Super soft, perfectly moist, well flavored pumpkin bread. Highly recommend! $4 and worth it!.Simple menu of yummy coffee drinks, and such friendly people working there. I feel energized (not just from the caffeine!) and happy every time I stop by. Delicious baked goods and so-so refrigerated stuff. I have yet to try a breakfast taco, but I look forward to getting to!"
"Niko Niko is a decent place to drop by if you need food in you asap. Their main business was takeout and (free) delivery; there aren't any seats in the small shop. Walking in felt like walking into a mini grocery store where pre-made sushi and other small dishes were made ready and put on display.The sushi was mediocre--tasted just like any other ""fast-food"" sushi in the city. I felt that the spicy Korean ramen was better. While the noodles and pork were fine, I thought the broth could be improved. For one, I felt that they went overboard with the spice level.The speed of which they made these two dishes from scratch was pretty amazing, so if you prize speed of delivery over taste, Niko Niko is a decent place to try. On that note, the employees were great..Niko Niko Sushi & Bowl is simply superb. It is pleasant place. I am really happy that I wound up ordering Tuna Avocado, Salmon Avocado and Eel Avocado Roll Combo, it was unbelievable, just a superb taste. Everybody was extremely pleasant. I highly recommend Niko Niko Sushi & Bowl for others..#pricing trap alert# Looking at the photo, how much do you expect beef soba to be?If you think it's 11.5 + tax, then you are thinking the same as the restaurant owner.But if you think it's 10.5 + tax, then you probably wanna stay away from this place for good..I've walked past Niko Niko several times and I decided to stop in for lunch on day last week. I got the chicken teri don with brown rice; brown rice is an extra $1 charge. My meal came out to $9.25 which isn't ideal since I was trying to go for a cheaper lunch option although that is cheap compared to other places in FIDI and Manhattan in general. I tried to pay with card but they do not accept card for charges under $10. My food took less than five minutes to be prepared, I took it to go; there is seating upstairs don't let the bare inside fool you. The dish was pretty standard, the chicken was seasoned well, the sauce was on the sweeter side similar if not the same as teriyaki sauce, there was a ton of rice which was average in taste, and there was only a few veggies; carrots and broccoli. I wish there were more veggies, I noticed there was an extra charge for them, which makes sense since there were particularly none in my dish. Decent meal, large portion, I'll go back to try their sushi..Fast food sushiDropped by this place after my workout to get a some sushi. There is nothing too amazing here - the food is not bad but it is not amazing. I had the beef udon soup and my only complaint was that the soup was REALLY salty. However, the wasabi edamame was pretty top notch..I've been working in the FiDi area for almost four years and I just discovered this place. I've seen it on my walks towards the seaport but I never gave it a second glance. Now I can't stop coming here for lunch.They have a variety of Asian foods - they have sushi, teriyaki, curry, ramen, bibimbap, stew, etc. They also have plenty of specialty Asian snacks such as shrimp chips and lychee candies. They also participate in MealPlan for those of you who are curious. I usually get the sushi, which is pretty fresh and made on the premises. You get a free miso soup if you get sushi. I've also had the chicken karaage, chicken curry, and spicy tofu stew. All were pretty good. I don't have anything particularly negative to say about Niko Niko. They have seating upstairs if you want to stay for your meal.Don't let the low rating deter from you coming here. Honestly, I don't know why the rating is so low. I can assure you that plenty of people come here and enjoy their food..Very good food for the price. Sushi station was bright and cheerful. Super nice cashier lady.  3-6pm sushi 30% off.  I ordered the beef yakisoba, eel avocado roll and tamago nigiri. Seating upstairs. There are a lot of Japanese snacks (e.g. pocky sticks) for sale too! Will be back!.I would agree mediocre fast food sushi at best with a couple soup options. Walk in and bring back to your desk type of deal. Not much more can be said..Not my personal favorite.Most sushi are pre made and fried dumplings were soso.The cashier seems to forget that I walked in during happy hour which then the items should have been discounted at a 30% She didn't apply the discount and charged me full price.But, there was a free edamame which was good. I think I paid for the so called free price.I would come back but only to buy 7.99 green tea ice cream mocchi, nothing else..Niko Niko is basically Fast Food Sushi.  I think it's better than ""convenience store"" or ""supermarket"" sushi, but not as good as sushi from a restaurant.It's nothing spectacular, but if you're in a hurry or need a quick sushi fix, then Niko is a decent option.They're pretty busy at lunch time, so the sushi doesn't sit for long which is a good thing.  I just think it's pretty basic and nothing to write home about.When I first started working in the Financial District, I would go to Niko often, but then I discovered Nu Sushi and Taste of Tokyo, so I go there instead as the prices are about the same.  Niko is slightly cheaper than those two places, like $8.75 vs $9.50 for a two roll combo, but the savings doesn't compensate for the lower quality you get.Two last things of interest.  They also serve noodles and noodle soups which are pretty good, but not exceptional.  And, if you come between 3pm and 6pm on weekdays, the sushi is 30% Off.  Only thing is, most of the better sushi and rolls are gone, so you're options are limited.  Still a pretty good deal though.But like I said, if you're in a hurry, or don't have the time or desire to walk 5 minutes to one of the other places I mentioned, then this is a fair option.  Just don't expect anything remarkable."
"I live within the community and have been a frequent but never checked in. This location is the best for speedy service, but accurate ordering. I arrived before 9am and ordered my son's bagel and cheese with butter. It was ready in 5 mins. This location also offers app online ordering, i had know idea so I've added the app to my phone.The location is clean, fast with orders and offer more than breakfast they serve ice cream and cakes. Cleanliness, service and fresh food bring me back 1 to 2 times a week. Please note the mental facility is near by so you'll sometimes run into vagrants in the front entrance begging for breakfast or money. ‍.I love Dunkin but this location is the worst. They messed up my order TWICE. I asked for a hummus toast with TOMATO and they added tomato and bacon when the menu doesn't even have the bacon option for the hummus toast only the avocado toast. Then she tried to tell me I ordered bagel bites when it CLEARLY says on my receipt that I ordered a CHEESE croissant stuffer. I didn't realize it until I bit into the croissant that she gave me the bacon stuffer. As a Muslim I DO NOT eat bacon, so not only did I just unintentionally sin because of them I also just wasted $12 of food because I couldn't eat any of it. I would have gone back to complain but it wasn't even worth being late for work. NEVER stopping here again..The worst.  No flavors.  No cones.  No variety.  Just bad. Needs better management.  Does not cater to customers.  Sad excuse for an ice cream parlor.  Nice people working there..I visit this location often, and used to work in Customer Service myself, so I didn't expect that the server didn't understand what I wanted, and did not ask me to clarify. When I used to be a member of the McDonald's team, with my consistent clients, I knew exactly what they wanted and would have the order or beverage ready before they even got to the cash register to pay. Customer service at this location sucks, and I wouldn't recommend unless you have time to waste. #SorryNOTSorry.Today is a Tuesday July 7th. I stood in line, and out of nowhere the cashier insisted on taking someone else that came in after me! So rude!  I was I was in a hurry . If you're in a hurry or impatient- do not come here.Didn't even say why. I politely backed up because I knew I'd come on here and yelp that bad customer service !.My go-to spot to grab coffee when I'm running late to work. The doughnuts here are always fresh. And the staff here prepare my drinks quickly.Pretty good as far as Dunkin' Donuts goes :).HORRIBLE FUCKING SERVICE!Anytime of day. Doesn't. Matter.You'd think late at night.. at 1:30 am you'd be able to at least get subpar service but nope not even that..Worst Dunkin' Donuts ever, how can an establishment be 24 hours and yet never have anything to serve? You name is Dunkin' Donuts you're next to a hospital that always have workers that would like something light and yet you never have donuts, your blender is always broken and half the staff do not know how to make proper drinks, they need to close down and try again, just downright horrible.Can't go here without being inundated by panhandlers first in the parking lot, the moment you get out of your car. THEN, as you approach the place and there is always someone at the door bugging you for money. THEN the WORST there is a beggar, sitting at the table that you have to pass going to and from the cashier. I gave her a quarter. She gave me a dirty look and mumbled under her breath. \Why the hell does this place allow this?Now for the coffee and donuts, I drink black coffee. N creamer or sweeteners of any kind. Been drinking black, Dunkin' Donuts coffee for years,. .'The coffee is like weak, dish water. It sucks,. Their donuts leave a lot to be desired, The customers who go here aren't your regular customers. More like gang bangers. The workers are just OK. Skip this 3rd world donut shop. Management shouldn't allow what is going on at this pathetic joint,.This location is kind of iffy for ambiance, slow reloads to the app and lots of beggars, but the coffee is always fresh and close to my favorite roti and tire shoppes.  We ordered on the app and less than 5 minutes later, it was ready to go.  There are chairs and tables to enjoy your coffee or ice cream treats as well. Strangely enough, people buy a lot of ice cream cakes, and fancy donuts so they must bake on-site.  My advice..... place your blinders on, order on the app, get your order, roll out quickly, and don't forget to tip these employees go through a lot over here."
"Started off with the Samusas, which were tasty, and a couple Ethiopian St George tastes just like a Peroni and the Addis is a nice light amber... a little like a fat tire but lighter. Yum! For dinner, we got special kifto and doro wot, which both came with injira and two sides. The special kifto is absolutely special, like a really unique slightly herbal steak tartare with this pleasant cardamom note, a  beautiful richness from the kibbeh (clarified butter) and a lingering but not overwhelming heat from the jalapeño. If you like steak tartare you MUST try this, it's amazing. The doro wat is also tasty: sort of like an Ethiopian mole sauce. For sides, we got the Gomen (collards), deffen mesir alicha (lentils) and denich wot (potatoes and carrot) which were all equally tasty but both my fiancé and I were legitimately obsessed with how good the yellow split peas or ater kik alicha were-- definitely going to order double next time!We were too stuffed to finish it all: definitely generous portions that will last for another day! Excited to come back and revisit this cozy family run spot again..Very good quality Ethiopian food is served at this informal place with both indoor and outdoor seating (not many seats, so go early). Service is welcoming and fast: we got our food within minutes after ordering it. Siga Wot (diced lean beef seared on a hot skillet, then slow-cooked in a berbere sauce): spicy and very yummy. Recommended. Lega Tibs (pieces of marinated lamb sautéed in onions, jalapeños and rosemary): I loved the flavor, although the meat looked a little old. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed what we ordered. The meat could have been of higher quality, but it was tasty nonetheless. We choose the collard greens (delicious), string beans (good) and beets (also good) as sides (2 sides are included in each entree). They bring you plenty of injera, but you can ask for more if you need. Recommended..The best Ethiopian food and the friendliest service! This is my go to spot every time I'm in the neighborhood. They have outdoor seating and their indoor tables are spaced out with dividers between the tables. Restaurant follows covid safety guidelines. :).Ordered through DoorDash and their customer service sucks so I couldn't tell the restaurant. But I had plastic in my food. I ended up choking on it, swallowing part of it and having a friend fish this remaining bit out of my throat. Thank god someone was here with me or this could've been way worse. I couldn't get this plastic piece out of my throat and was stuck choking. Food tasted fine before this. Oof that was terrifying..The food was good, but honestly I personally do not love Injera.We took the easy option of the Meat and Veggie Sampler for 2, which gave us a small taste of everything available. I enjoyed all the meat and veggies, I just don't really like injera, which is the staple of the Ethiopian meal. We did love the Beef Sambusa appetizer though..The food is INCREDIBLE! Been going here for years with my partner and it's the best Ethiopian food in NYC! The restaurant atmosphere is beautiful and the owners are so welcoming.The food is amazing!!!! The owner and staff are wonderful!!! You're missing out if you do not eat here!.Love this neighborhood gem! The food is delicious and the atmosphere is small, cute and pleasant..Wow so impressed with the food!!! The portions are great and the dishes are each so unique and flavorful. The meat and veggie platter is well balanced and could easily feed 3. The owner was very welcoming and explained what each dish was, outdoor seating was nice! I will definitely be coming back ASAP.This place is such a treat! If you're sick of eating American or Italian... You definitely need to give Ethiopian food a try! The owners are so very nice. They have a wine selection from Ethiopia which really intrigued me as I have lived in France. We ordered the sambusa which was OK but don't fill up on appetizers... definitely get one of their meats or vegetables on the fermented bread. If I go back I will be only ordering vegetables because they were so delicious. I also remember liking the minced lamb in the lighter green sauce (in pictures). The food was so flavorful... It makes me want to become a vegetarian because if vegetables can be seasoned that well as well as lentils... Why not switch over?All in all: I give this restaurant a five out of five!!! I definitely will be back... This is a great restaurant for a Sunday afternoon when you just like to eat some nice comfort food and enjoy a quiet and cozy restaurant in Harlem.I'm writing this review from November.  We had an excellent dining experience, and the food was delicious.  The food was neatly presented, and the service was attentive!  I will definitely return again!"
"Service. A+Smiles A++Food Excellent Typical old fashion seating Two tables that sit 4-6people each.Clean place15 min Waiting time for my order of shrimp fried rice and chicken wings..Never got a chance to eat the food. When I called and asked for a delivery,  the girl who answered the phone said no delivery and slammed the phone down. I called back because I wanted to make sure I understood what she said. When she answered the phone again she acted as if I was bothering her asking a question and yelled no and slammed the phone again. Based on that I wouldn't even want takeout..I have been coming here for awhile now the service is great food is wonderful could be a Lil cleaner but hey I would recommend this Lil spot to anyone who likes good Chinese food.Really good local chinese food.  I had written a review years ago when this place was owned by others.  Back then I got sick from the food twice.  The new owners do a really good job at keeping this place clean.  The food is awesome.  I have tried many things from the menu and have not gotten sick."
This place is filthy and smells very bad I honestly do not know how people continue to eat at this Chinese restaurant.  I have been living in this neighborhood for about 10 years and when I first moved here this restaurant was great however nowadays I don't know if it's the new administration or what but the food is horrific I got sick from the chicken and broccoli about a year ago and that is when I stopped eating there..Stay away from this place.  I have lived in this neighborhood for 11 years.  When I first moved in the original owners were amazing in keeping it clean and serving real good food.  Now this place has passed several hands and the current owners keep it filthy and the food is sub-par.  My cousin got sick off their chicken and brocoli.  Chicken had a really bad smell to it he tells me.   Wish I could give it ZERO stars.
"Amazing service.....not rude like all the other places Great food cooked the right way I highly recommend this place...I'm from New Jersey so I don't really like New York But coming here is must.Happened to be in the area for an appointment and was really craving a diner breakfast. I'm originally from New Jersey and I tend to be a little over critical of NYC diners.However, we walked in on a Sunday morning and it was packed. We waiting for about 15 minutes before we could get a booth. Once we sat down we were promptly attended and we ordered two omelette one with home fries and one with regular fries.I got the Florentine and I was really impressed with how fluffy the omelette was! The french fries were also crispy on the outside and nice and pillowly on the inside. The toast was nice and buttery and the coffee wasn't overly watery. Not to mention that we got our food right away despite the place being busy.The service and food were great highly recommend checking them out!.Honestly one of the best spots to eat I've been at in a long time. Quick service, delicious food, well kept restaurant. Awesome eating experience!Michael LevyPrincipal Broker at Grand Lux Realty.Came here for a breakfast with my dad and sister and it's a sweet gem. You can tell this is run by local folks, everyone was super friendly. The food was typical diner food which was exactly what we were looking for. Had the feta spinach omelette and although i didn't taste much of the tangy-ness of the feta it was still great!.I live not far from this place and as long I been to this place I always love their breakfast but lately I notice a lack of consistency,maybe because I order through Grub Hub but the pancakes and food taste like they're a bit rushly made.The eggs are like rubbery like they got it from an egg beater carton.I feel for a local neighborhood diner their food should be of more better quality,it's not bad but they could definitely take it uo a notch..No customer service. Keep your fingers crossed. So sad, if was never like this before!.I used to live in the neighborhood. This is THE diner. The food is awesome. My wife and I still drive down about once a month to get our staples, I get the Mexican omelette, she the corned beef hash. The staff is friendly, knows us, asks us if we want the usual and the comfort food comes out quick, delicious and cheap!.Awesome place! Food drinks and service all was excellent!!! the outdoors very pretty you can have table and enjoyed especially if you take a your entire family!.The coffee is outstanding and I have always had friendly and accommodating service, no matter how busy the house was. This place is working with the best beans in the area. You can tell they use quality ingredients. Everyone who works here is super friendly. There was absolutely nothing to complain about here!.One of my favorite places to go in the neighborhood my dad and I always eat here at least once every couple weeks the servers are so nice and it feels very homey. The food is delicious and fair priced. If you live nearby this a good place to come for any kind of diner food! They even have all kinds of pastries as well! P.S. there milkshakes here are bomb!"
"212 steakhouse is definitely one of the best I have been to in NYC. It's truly a remarkable experience. Everything we ordered was delicious from the cocktails to the appetizers and to the high quality steaks.Once we sat down I was already very impressed by the complimentary bread. It was warm and the butter they served was amazing. We ordered the strawberry mojito and mango lemonade and they were so fruity and paired perfectly with the food. We started off with the grilled octopus; it was amazing with a wonderful mix of flavors and textures; it had the crispy charred exterior but very soft inside. We also ordered the lobster bisque and it's the best lobster soup I've ever had; it was so rich with a lot of lobster meat; it's very flavorful with a hint of sweetness. We also got their signature Kobe beef steak which came with Kobe beef ribeye, Kobe beef sirloin and Kobe beef tenderloin. They were super juicy and tender. We also got the Australian T-bone and it was cooked to perfection! No sauce needed because it was insanely juicy and yummy. Will definitely come back; great food, great service! Totally recommend this place!.One of my favorite steak experiences ever!We started off with some fried calamari which was fresh and tasty. We also got a couple of sides - mashed potatoes and lobster mac & cheese. Both were incredibly delicious. The real highlight was our main course - the Kobe beef ribeye. Sliced right through like butter and literally melted in our mouths! We've been to Japan twice and can confidently say this was the real deal. Back when we visited, it was in August 2020, so COVID restrictions were in place and we dined outdoors. We're looking forward to trying the indoor dining experience next time. Can't wait to go back!.I stumbled upon 212 Steakhouse for a drink and little did I know it is the only restaurant in the East Coast serving authentic Kobe beef! As soon as I went in, I noticed their impressive certification in Japanese on the wall! (Yes, I'm native Japanese so I could read it.)I haven't had the pleasure of trying their steak yet but I would be very excited to, and having a drink at the bar was a memorable, great experience as the owner and the bartender were very friendly, attentive and fun to talk to!Thank you for spreading the great Japanese delicacy to NYC!! Looking forward to going back!!.Outstanding service! It could have been a scene ripped right out of a movie: our waiter, a jovial man with a thin mustache, rounded featured, and a slight Latin American accent that added to the romanticism of the scene, welcomed us with smiles. He calmly and kindly explained the menu, was SO apologetic that certain items weren't halal (yet! They are working on getting Halal burgers), and when it came time for dessert, he so kindly had our slice of cake decorated with ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate sauce on the side and a little candle in the strawberries too! This was old school, fine dining waiting and for this classy experience alone I would come back to 212. Now the steak might be the main attraction but don't miss out on the seafood! The ""Grilled Octopus"" was the most perfectly cooked octopus I've ever had in my life. It was not rubbery at all - it was almost like a roast chicken. The tangy flavor of the sauce and capers accented the octopus well. The steak was succulent, with a good combination of fatty and meaty bites. I loved the whole peppercorns - little bulbs of bright red that popped in my mouth with as much flavor as they had color. The ""Black Truffle Risotto"" had a generous helping of black truffle flavor. I feel like I didn't know what black truffle really was until I had it in this dish. It made the price well worth it. I wish it had been a bit spicier. The mashed potatoes were silky smooth LASTLY! Don't leave without having some dessert. These are top notch. The ""triple layer chocolate mousse cake"" is like the one from Costco but - I can't believe I'm admitting this - even BETTER..212 steakhouse serves authentic Kobe beef that comes from pure blood ""Tajima-gyu"" cows in Japan. Their menu carries everything I love to eat honestly. They even have halal cuts and regular cuts if you aren't a fan of the fatty beef. This might be the only high end halal steak house I know of honestly. They also have really delicious mocktails. My bf and I tried the strawberry nojito and the Shirley temple. They were both very fruity drinks and paired nicely with our steaks. We started off with the burrata. The imported Italian Burrata with tomatoes, capers, and basils were really good. The burrata was very fresh and creamy on the inside. the tomatoes capers and basils didn't just add flavor and textures but completed the dishes presentation beautifully. The Mediterranean Salad had heirloom tomatoes, cucumbers, mini roasted sweet peppers, olives, and feta cheese. It is the most delicious Greek inspired salad I had. Every bite was very refreshing. I basically ate this whole salad on my own. It was really good.  We also got half a dozen of oysters, their raw oysters were super fresh. Each slurp was so shucking delicious. I could eat 100 more of them. For our meats, we tried the Kobe Tasting. The tasting comes with Kobe Beef Ribeye 3 oz, Kobe Beef Striploin 3 oz, Kobe Beef Tenderloin 3 oz. Our favorite cut would have to be the tenderloin. It was super juicy and tender. My bf wanted a leaner cut as well, he got the New York strip. I do recommend you tell them how you want it cooked, I think we forgot to tell them, they cooked it medium well which is how my bf likes it, but I think I would have preferred a more medium rare meat. When our meats came, the waiters allowed us to take some pics first before cutting it in front of us. He cut the Kobe first and shaved a giant Himalayan salt rock over it. I never seen anything like it. For our NY strip, he sliced the steak and placed a rosemary over it before using a torch to burn the aroma over the steak and shaving the salt. The whole presentation was fun to watch and felt so luxurious. We also ordered a side of bourbon peppercorn steak sauce, it gave the steak a little kick. We had to get a pasta dish, well not really pasta but we ordered a black truffle and wild mushroom risotto. It was so creamy and the truffle aroma was strong. We also got a side of lobster Mac n cheese, it could have been cheesier in my opinion because I am a cheese girl, but it was really good, you get good chunks of lobster meats. We also got a side of potato au gratin, my bf really liked that side, it was creamy and the potatoes were cooked perfectly. At the end of the meal we got a tiramisu and chocolate soufflé. The tiramisu had a strong espresso flavor, it was so soft. The soufflé was warm and when combined with the vanilla ice cream, chefs kiss! Overall, our whole experience was very lux and fancy, we thought this would be a great place to celebrate an anniversary or birthday. We saw many muslim families walk in as they also serve halal cuts. My boyfriend is also muslim, his diet isn't as strict but we definitely appreciate the option..This place has been on my fiancée bucket list for quite some time. We finally made it for our early valentines date night !We started off with a shrimp cocktail and Cesar salad which had a MOUNTAIN of cheese so delicious . He had the 212 experience which had skirt steak and the most delicious piece of Kobe wow, I had the half a lobster stuffed with crabmeat, incredible. We both shared the truffle mash and broccoli rabe. The drinks were amazing and strong I highly recommend this for a date night spot !.This place was recommended by a friend so we went, it was delixouS ! Had the shrimp cocktail and ceasar salad both fantastic . Also had the Kobe experience so good will be back ! Lobster fantastic also.Hands down one of the best restaurants all around, but especially in NYC. Great atmosphere, very well trained staff, and divine food and drinks. Their 212 premium selection platter for two is the way to go. Worth every single penny. The taste and the quality of the meat is unmatched, literally melts in your mouth. We started with a cheese plate and an arugula salad which were both good portion sizes and so good. For dinner we had the 212 premium selection, roasted brussel sprouts, and lobster mac and cheese... these pictures do not even do it justice. The steak was perfectly medium rare. The brussel sprouts were so flavorful and crispy. And that mac and cheese, served.We ate, and left no crumbs. We also had the chocolate souffle for dessert which was just the cherry on top of a perfect meal. Then had to literally roll ourselves out of there. This place exceeded all of our expectations and we will definitely be dining here again & recommending to everyone!.Terrible! This is one of those places that are hyped up simply because they serve zabiha steaks. We ordered two ribeyes and one t-bone that were very cold when they arrived to our table. We sent them back asking for new ones because warming them up would further cook the steaks. They did not make new ones because the one ribeye I had ripped off to taste was put back on the dish as a complete puzzle. Furthermore, they were still cold. We sent them back and then again the third time, sure the temperature was better but the sides were burned. The steak had no flavor. We make better steaks at home. We asked for flaky salt and got table salt. What kind of steakhouse doesn't have flaky salt? The sides are incredibly expensive and are additional pay, nothing comes with the steaks! Very disappointed! So much money down the drain. Don't waste your time just because they offer zabiha steaks and the food ""looks"" good!.We came to 212 steakhouse on a Tuesday night in time for their halal restaurant week. The atmosphere was absolutely fantastic and the waiters were very attentive. We got the grilled octopus, ribeye, lamb chop, mashed potato, and the chocolate souffle. Grilled octopus: 4.5/5 - I loved this octopus, it was tender and full of flavor. My companion didn't like it as much as me though. Ribeye: 4/5 - We got this medium and the fat that came with the meat was underwhelming and it was a little more medium rare in some parts than medium. The presentation was superb though. Lamb chops: 4.5/5 - I asked for medium, and the lamb came out perfect and was super tasty! Mashed potato: 3/5 - Our least favorite dish. There was a strong buttery aftertaste that did not pair well with our meats in my opinion. The texture was perfect though. Chocolate souffle - 4/5 - A nice little dessert to cap of a great meal!Overall a solid steakhouse experience - I absolutely love how they have halal meats as an option..I just want to start off by saying 212 Steakhouse probably have the best service I've received in a long while! Their staffs are extremely attentive and trying to make sure you have a great experience from the moment you walk in. Beside their phenomenal service, the food here speaks for itself. The steaks are super filling and delicious, they have a section from halal steaks to choose from and you can't go wrong with their lobster Mac and cheese"
"I don't know how anyone can give this place less than five stars. I've been ordering Uber eats from here for years and I finally went in person while I was walking home from shopping and wanted to grab a quick bite. Just really really good Katsu Curry, and a great spot to recommend to people who have never had Japanese curry before. Perfectly savory and delicious, cooked to perfection, i've never had a bad experience with them!.small fast-casual Japanese curry eatery. there are like 2-3 small tables inside for dine-in but this seems primarily like a takeout place. the interior is clean and maintained fairly well. basically you order your rice, protein, curry combo, & any extras, and it's packed to go or for dine-in. the food is solidly good, but feels overpriced based on portion and value. got the small pork katsu, combo. the curry and pork katsu were both prepared and tasted fine. however the portion seemed on par with the pre-prepared curries at any Japanese supermarkets (where the price would be fairly less). you can order larger portions of the curry combos at Go Go Curry but the price ends up being about the same as any sit-down Japanese restaurant with waiter service. don't really see the value at Go Go Curry as a fast casual place as the portions feel smaller and the prices seem higher than other options--also things like fukujinzuke are typically included with a curry but they charge extra for it, here. that's said, the curry is worth it if you have limited options and are in the mood for Japanese curry. the staff are nice and move fast. My food was packaged well and neatly for takeout. drops mic cuz i need my curry in a hurryi outzzz.Decent place for a quick bite! You order on the kiosk and the waiter at the counter will call your name when it is ready. They don't have free water, so make sure to also order a drink! The katsu pieces are pretty thin and small. The sauce wasn't as flowy, but it was still decent. Good for casual quick bites!.Really solid spot for katsu curry!! They do one thing and they do it well. This is a fast casual place perfect for a grab and go meal if you find yourself in Midtown East. I got the large pork katsu curry, which comes with a lot of rice and cabbage. Unless you're extremely hungry, it's definitely big enough for 2 meals!.A tiny Go Go Curry nestled between all the bars and restaurants of Turtle Bay. There's also a Beard's Papa a few doors down, which makes a perfect duo! We came here to grab a quick, late meal. Pork Katsu was great, flavorful and meat was tender. The outside was crispier than the chicken, but pork did have fatty bits that I had to spit out. Their curry is a thick goopy delicious mess, deep in flavors. This location is definitely stingy with the rice, which I haven't experienced at other spots.I tried the Chicken Katsu and while good, paled in comparison to the pork, as it was more bland and slightly soggier. I prefer the original Midtown West location on 38th/8th, which gives a better portion, and their curry particularly packs a flavor punch!.Was really excited to stumble across this curry place in New York. I tried Go Go curry for the first time when I was in Japan and it was so amazing. So glad that there's a joint available in the US. The curry they serve here is darker and more savory than your typical Japanese curry. I got the large bowl with chicken katsu, shrimp, and sausage. It's super delicious, literally heaven in a bowl. I would recommend you to try and it's quite filling!.We have been going to this place for years! Today, absolutely horrible customer service. Just straight up rude and unprofessional. Called ahead to make a pick up order, girl on the line picked up very unenthusiastically, I tried to make an order, she hung up the line mid order. Tried calling back multiple times with no one picking up or hanging up the call immediately. Went to the store in-person. Two workers by the ringing phone and when asked about the call, worker refused to acknowledge customer complaint. Completely heartbroken by one of my favorite Go Go Curry spots. The awful customer service does not do the great food justice..Go-Go Curry is a fast casual joint offering Japanese katsu as its centerpiece.Its a simple, hearty meal. I ordered the ""Home Run"" (costs $16 as of jul21,2021) - fried katsu (pork), sliced cabbage, sliced hardboiled egg, tempura, sausage link, over a bed of koshihikari rice doused with japanese curry sauce. Extra side of fukujinzuke (pickled veggies).Yummy overall. A tad salty toward the end with alot of curry sauce plus the sausage, but yummy. Chased it with a bottle of water (extra $2). Two light eaters could split the home run meal in terms of portion. If big appetites, def get your own separate dishes.Not my first time at this food chain, and won't be my last!.I placed an order for pickup for the first time. I'm glad I ordered an extra side of rice. It was a bit pricey for the portion but it was very good!.Small location in Midtown East. I've really only gone here for pickup. The Pork/Chicken Katsu Curry are tasty. However, I have to rate this place a 1 star. The last time I went here I got extremely bad food poisoning so I will not be back. I'll go to a different location next time."
"Came over here for the weekend with my family, it was recommended by many family friends so we decided to try it out for ourselves. It was a Saturday night and it was pretty loud when we arrived. It was loud to the point where I have to raise my voice to talk. But the service was great and attentive to our needs.Pina colada: pretty good, they did not hold back on the alcohol.Chicken dumpling (steamed): it was a standard dish of 6 dumplings. It was nice and chewy.Chicken and broccoli combo: a decent portion and the food was good. The dish included an egg roll. Dessert: chocolate ice cream. Overall, an affordable place to go out to eat with friends and family. There's a bar so it's great for those looking for a night out to eat and drink. It might be loud during peak hours. I recommend for friends..Always great food! Plenty of vegan/vegetarian options . Buddha delight is very  good! Lots of Chinese and Japanese options. I've cream served with every meal-Get the pistachio.I was very disappointed with my take out order.  The Lomein house special was the worse.  I understand that during the pandemic people had a lot of loss but if you  are going to raise your prices you don't cut back on orders.The shrimp in the lomein was counted as 3 and the size of a nickel curled up.The pork and chicken was shredded very thin.  Lomein was all stuck together.  Very disappointing.  Also, if you do not ask for extra duck sauce you will not get it according to the order.  I asked for extra and did not get.  The rest of the order was just ok..Oriental Plaza a friendly place to dine. The staff is professional & the service is impeccable. We had Raymond as our waiter as always. He remembers his customers. Started with a delicious mai tai. Had the green salad and then my husband & I ordered the breaded sea bass. My husband had it with a ginger & scallion sauce. I had the garlic sauce. Both servings were crispy & delicious. My husband topped his dinner off with 2 scoops of chocolate ice cream. The restaurant has an extensive wine & cocktail menu. They also have a nice Chinese & Japanese menu. Prior to Covid the menu was larger, but the new menu has a nice selection. If you are looking for good food go to Oriental Plaza..The worst ""Chinese food"" I've ever had. I bought boneless spare ribs which were dry slabs of meat, chicken and broccoli had no flavor, broccoli and garlic sauce was edible but it didn't have the traditional sauce it was very runny, Buddha's delight with black bean sauce was greasy and flavorless, and the wonton soup didn't had some weird meat inside and the noodle didn't taste good. The fried rice didn't taste good at all. Overall it was the worst chinese food I've ever had..The food is delicious and delivery times are pretty decent.  I've never eaten in the restaurant so I can't speak to that part..We ordered from Oriental Plaza on New Year's Day.  We have previously ordered from them and were pleased with them.  Well New Years Day was no different, the shrimp and broccoli and fried rice were delicious.  The place was busy but our order was fresh, hot, and ready in no time..Love this restaurant. Great place for a party or to just go for a bite to eat. Food is A++ and very reasonably priced, service is excellent and managers John & Simon are both very friendly and Accommodating. I've had & attended many parties here as well as a quiet dinner with husband, & super pleased with everything each and every time!.I have this place five stars because it's a really great space for parties of over 20 and they have 3 rooms you can use for it. The owners will work with you to tailor your experience. Chinese food is classically prepared and they can make authentic Chinese food like you would find in Chinatown in NY. Visit if your in the area!.This is a great Chinese Restaurant! We often order from Oriental and sometimes eat at their Restaurant that is not your typical Chinese venue. The place is big and very comfortable and the service is second to none. This people know how to make you feel welcome and that's why you see entire families with children over there. Also, very cheap guys!!!It's really hard to pinpoint a favorite dish because they are all amazing but I am crazy for the sesame chicken, pepper steak and shrimp on garlic sauce. The only thing I wish they should improve is to make more spicy options. Every time I ask them to put some pepper on it still not enough. But this does not stop me to eat their food at least once a week - - - the kids love iwhich makes things much easier. Highly recommend this venue..This is a great Chinese Restaurant!

"The good news is that there are plenty of places to sit here. And there is an upstairs with tables. The bad news is that the service is atrocious. Incredibly slow. If there are two or three people in front of you, expect to wait at least 20 minutes. There is never a sense of urgency..Mobile order is really quick. Now that people are getting back to work this place us getting super busy again. I odered grande passionfruit iced tea w no Ice. Then a side of cup of ice. Double the drink.Quick pit stop at Starbucks to grab some much needed caffeine. They were out of their nitro coffee, so they were kind enough to upgrade my drink to anything on the menu. Appreciate the great customer service at this location..Five start because the cashier was welcomingThe Barista guy on Friday wasn't friendly but I guess because it is in Times Square, very very busy area. Stressful for some staff..This is a pretty busy Starbucks as being right in the heart of the fashion District on seventh Avenue. And they still maintain such friendliness and care for the customers. I ordered the new pistachio latte and the barista informed me that it was the first one of its kind that she had ever made. To be so lucky! It was delicious I highly recommend trying while it's still on the menu..Starbucks is amazing any where you go. We went to Starbucks in New York and their drinks came in handy. Warmed my entire body. The customer service ideas amazing. They shears had a smile on their face..Very disorganized slow servicing. They need a process and a strong manger plan on a 15 min wait min to get your drink.  I like to give food feedback but this is an ongoing situation. Friendly staff just not working efficiently.This Starbucks location is a nightmare. The lines are always insanely long, even with 5-6 employees behind the counter. It takes forever to get a drink. To make matters worse, when I came here a few days ago, the barista gave me a bent cup, so when I went to take a drink of my hot tea, it spilled out down the front of my jacket. Not ideal!Save yourself the headache and go to another location - this one is a mess..WHO KNEW COMMERCIAL MATCHA EXISTED. I was excited to know Starbucks actually sold matcha latte but I was a bit skeptical. I was right to say the least. I am grateful that I had matcha latte at Café that specialize in making there drinks from scratch. No commercial short cuts to be precise. Starbucks matcha latte was soooo creamy it threw me off. Like it was too creamy. It honestly some how felt like creamer was in it instead of milk. It just was too thick. I just don't even know how to describe it. It's not even on their menu. I just ask them because my co worker was getting something to drink for me. Matcha Latte is a bit grainy. It's basically green tea. So it's a bit strong but good. The taste you kinda got to get use to. So I can understand why maybe this is the reasoning behind Starbucks creating a creamy one. Something easy that people would like.Unfortunately, I don't like it because I got introduce to original matcha latte early on. so if your like me you will likely not like it. If you never had matcha ever and don't mind a creamer version, then hit any Starbucks for it. I personally don't think it's great because of the fact that's it's not on your menu. I guess it's apart of the Ghost Starbucks menu. Ha! Who knew it existed..First of all, I like starbucks and its my coffee store of choice so not shitting on starbucks in general just this location specifically.  Today I ordered a venti cinnamon dolce latte, light on the ice, no whipped cream.  I ordered it on my mobile app for pick up.  When I picked it up I could tell the drink was 95% milk and ice because it was so light in color that I tasted the drink before I left just to make sure there was coffee in it....It tasted like flavored milk.  I thought about saying something but decided because of previous experiences here it would be no use.  Last week I ordered a bacon gouda sandwich during morning rush hour on my mobile app, just the sandwich no coffee.  I knew I would have to wait but from experience the food items tend to come out earlier than the drinks.  I waited for 20mins and finally decided to ask the cashier I ordered with if he wouldn't mind checking on my sandwich because I saw him wiping the counters.  He checked and I could see that there was nothing on the oven and nothing in the que, I watched him put a bacon gouda in the grill machine thing and tell me it was heating up, I waited, then I saw one of the young ladies behind the counter take my sandwich and bag it and give it to a gentleman that had just walked up to the counter.  When I asked them about this she told me there was a que and I had to wait......I tried to explain the situation but she just repeated that there was a que and I had to wait.....no words.....  If this place wasn't so conveniently located on my commute I wouldn't go here anymore."
"It's Monday at 9:45, the place is very quiet and very clean. The staff is always nice and they take their time to make sure what I want is what I get, (a slight language barrier).We got the:Salted fish w. minced meat casserole which was delicious. Be prepared to wait 30 min. for this one. But, its a large portion with a good amount of fish, topped off with fresh ginger and scallion. Make sure to dig deep for that crispy rice.Fresh pork rice rolls have a lot of flavor. They are not cheap with the pork. I highly reccommend it.Pork n squid congee came out very hot and had a good amount of stuff. I specially love the fresh ginger and peanuts. The squid was tough and the soup itself had a little too much thickener (corrnstarch?). Overall, its a good dish.We've eaten here before. Whatever we ordered has been very good. They're famous for their honey wings..Still one of my favorite place for yummy bbq roasted meats. Came here with hubby on a Saturday afternoon (1pm) on April 11 hungry after grocery shopping for the entire household. It was a long wait; everyone was lined up 6 feet outside the restaurant (we were 2 stores down from the main door) for at least an hour. I believed each person was placing large orders because each time a person left with 2-4 bags full of food that it worried the rest of us (we all wondered if there would be enough food left for us). The lady before me ordered extra meat and bones because I saw poultry necks and bits through one large bulging bag. Hubby and I ordered 2 lunch boxes, 1 rice roll and a half roast duck to go. When I got in, they barely had enough duck but then a staff in the back came back with some freshly roasted duck which made me very happy. Hubby ordered the 3-combination meat over rice (roast duck, soy sauce chicken, roast pork), I ordered the roast duck over rice and crispy roast pork with egg rice rolls (it also contain cabbage veggies) and an order of half duck to go..Been here a few times, mostly for the roast meats as takeout. This is a female run restaurant (only saw 1 guy once, I think he is the one that roast the meats because he came from downstair with hooks of roast chicken and ducks to put by window and left). Place is always busy, clean and great service. Roast meats always fresh, crispy looking and delish! Never looks dry.They offer roast meats, noodles, rice, congee, rice casseroles and steam rice rolls. This review is for Saturday 11/2. Came here for late breakfast (brunch 11:54am) with hubby. We both wanted something warm (soupy) and their delicious roast meats. We got tea, an order of steamed rice rolls with mixed sauce (no roast meats since we getting it for our meals) and 2 bowls of ho fun noodles with honey crispy roast pork & added roasted duck to our bowl (add extra roast meat $1 unless it's honey crispy roast pork $2). Yummyy and we'll be back..For weeks, I've been wanting to try this place out based off the one yelper who raved about their wontons, and just like that, I was on a wonton binge hunt. Meaning, if i so happened to be in a chinese restaurant, I just had to get wonton noodles. Due to their early closing time of 9pm and my long hours, I didn't have the chance.. until recently! It looks like your  typical ""roasted meat"" places... not so typical, big wall arts of the Underground stations. I was expecting mediocre service, when it \was the complete opposite. Four really nice ladies working their stations. I saw no male workers. It was nice, a breath of fresh air. When I stated this to my dinner partner, I was called a feminist. Well, how many ladies have you ever seen manning the chopping board? Uh huh. That's what I thought. It was fascinating and mesmerizing to watch the lady making the fresh steam rice rolls since I've never seen it freshly made before.Food:Wonton noodles: Four wontons, each with a shrimp (!) with the noodles. I liked the noodles. The soup was ok. There's some cabbage for good measure. Maybe I'll get just wontons next time.Vegs: I don't know my vegetables, whatever it is, it was soft and cooked just right with the right amount of oyster sauce.Half a soy sauce chicken: I think we had initially ordered the regular steamed chicken with the ginger scallion sauce but were given soy sauce chicken instead. It was ok, you can't really mess this up lolTofu 'custard'/tofu faa: It's not as silky as I'd like it to be and it was served piping hot (like almost burned my mouth hot) with the sweet syrup. The lady told us to let her know if we needed more syrup... we didn't. It was ok though. Recommend? Yes. I'd like to try their steamed rice rolls and other foods for sure..It's perfect! Congee and cheung fun is better than other Chinese restaurant in brooklyn.We always would pass by Double Fire Gourmet when we would run errands on 86th Street, but Saturday was our lucky day that we decided to give it a go around lunch time.  Thanks to the picture menu posted on their window outside, we quickly decided to get some fire in our bellies.You walk in and seat yourself; much like most Chinese establishments.  If there's room you can squeeze, do it.  We literally got the last empty table that was closer to the door, but we were quickly served hot tea - oolong too!We first got an order of chinese vegetables in oyster sauce ($6), and although the price was a little steep, I always need to have them.  We also got the rice roll with mixed sauce, which comprised of peanut sauce and a thicker soy sauce with sprinkled sesame seeds - a MUST!  So light and fluffy; great for sharing too!For the main dishes, I decided on the soy sauce chicken with Hong Kong style rice noodles, and the hubby got Hong Kong rice noodles with wontons that were actually stuffed with meat AND shrimp!  They totally looked homemade and were also savory.  The soy sauce chicken was the clear winner for me; be careful of the little bones though!  The five spices mix that they use on the chicken is so wonderful and the chicken was so moist, it coats the noodles perfectly.All of this can be yours at an affordable $30 even; cash is king here!.Food here is fresh and good portion with cheap price. We always order here from congee to lo mein. They have great honey roast pork (char xiu). Yummy. PLUS: good portion and slightly cheaper  than other in the same block.Everyone should pay attention when going to this store This store is not honest in business. On 5/20/2020, I bought half a roast duck. When I returned home, I found that it was 1/3 less than other stores. The duck's upper legs were gone.  The duck breast was also detained for 1-2 pieces.  I know that business is not easy to do now, it doesn't matter if the price is high, but you can't do this to deceive consumers.  This behavior makes me very uncomfortable, and I will never go again in the future. Please pay attention when you go here to consume.大家去这家店时要注意这家店做生意不老实5/20/2020去买了半只烧鸭，回到家发现比其它店买的少了有1/3，鸭上腿没了，鸭胸肉也被扣了1-2块。我知道现在时期生意不好做，价钱贵点没关系，但你不可以做这种欺骗消费者的事。这样的行为让我很不舒服，以后再也不会再去了，各位去这里消费的时候也要注意。.2.5 starsFu Kee has always been my go-to for Cantonese style meats, congee, noodles, etc. in the area but I decided to give this place a try after seeing them promoting their new hot and sour noodle soup (I am a big fan of hot and sour anything). Although smaller, Double Fire is a lot cleaner than Fu Kee and the workers are friendlier as well. However, the food at Fu Kee is still miles better. We got the rice rolls with hoisin/peanut butter sauce and the rice roll was all falling apart and seemed like it was just carelessly scraped off the cooking tray. I'm sorry but this really isn't that hard to make and Fu Kee does it perfectly every time. We also tried the combination congee with beef, pork and squid and it was bland and watery. Another point for Fu Kee where you can literally get the best congee in Bensonhurst IMO. As for the hot and sour noodle soup, I thought that it came with 3 types of meat, as they advertise on their poster, but it turns out you only choose 1. If you want all 3 then it's $15, which is insane since that's approaching Manhattan ramen prices and I know that this is not Japanese ramen quality. The taste was nothing to write home about. The spiciness is from the chili oil that they add and the sourness is from the pickled vegetables. I haven't tried the roast meats here yet but seeing the decline in quality of the roast meats at other restaurants in the neighborhood, I wouldn't mind giving this place a try since it's so close by. But in terms of congee, noodles, etc. Fu Kee still wins..Actually I wanna say bad service . Very bad . They're didn't know how to manage customer walk in order . So missy . I wanna rate negative. But the app doesn't has it . So disappointed.Terrible roast pork in the worlds.. Tastes like put in there over a week and keep reheat and sell it again and they are price higher then somewhere else"
"It took me a bit long to write this review and I always forget about going back here. There's a reason why they've been open for such a long time. It's not the best Mexican food you will ever have but it is a whole lot better then 90% of the other places in the area (outside of the local cart nearby my workspace/ I think I just realized why I forgot about this place, lo siento.) I have had the chicken enchilladas with mole/enmoladas de pollo several times and it is always tasty and the chips in the beginning are fine. Special note to their agua frescas, specifically their tamarindo. It is nicely sour and they give you just as big a glass as some of the Mexican carts. The service is fine and the food is fine. Low 4..As a family, we've been visiting Mexico Lindo for almost 20 years. Whenever we're in Manhattan, we make it a point to visit. So right there- that- should be my review. Every meal here is delicious and the owners are friendly with everyone and strive to make your visit fantastic. On this visit we had a very large group - which sometimes meant our requests took a bit longer than usual. But what can I say when they bring us after dinner drinks for being loyal customers!!?! We love it here and you will too..Wow! I had fish tacos made with cod fish, amazing. Truly authentic, not Mexican made for Americans.Came with rice and black beans, again delicious!Fresh, great food! Keep it up!. The service was alsoGreat. I believe it's family owned, so they're taking careOf business! For real!!.Ate here for dinner on a Saturday night. We walked in and were seated at a table outside for 4 within 5 min. Safely precautions were followed closely as the waitress wiped down the entire table and chairs and changed the tablecloth. We shared a pitcher of margarita along with nachos, veggie enchiladas and a chicken quesadilla. Everything was delicious! A solid option to satisfy that mexican food itch..Delicious food for Brunch on Mother's Day. Staff are so friendly and attentive.  Definitely will return to sit at the bar area..I feel there's a new Mexican spot popping up like in every NYC corner. Mexico Lindo in the Kips Bay area though, has been long-running...for 47 years! Lindo is more about comfort food. And by the way- it's far, far away from the whole farm-to-table flow, diet fads or the latest trends we all know. And if Tacos are what you're looking for- this isn't it. Instead, it's more entrees than anything else: stewed Fish, Shrimp dishes, meats, etc. Lindo's style is cozy, almost villa-style with brick walls showing through. Decent-sized dining space, small bar area at the far end and a cozier seating area with 26th St's side view. Aside from a few folks dining in the main area, we practically had the area to ourselves by the window side. Service was friendly from the guys on the floor and our server Ely. And let me not forget... Old school Salsa with Frankie Ruiz, Jerry Rivera and so many others- played throughout the night. Since I'm detoxing majorly, Tamarindo Juice was it- and boy....that sh*t was amazing! While hubs had the Sangria which he said was, ""good"". I really wanted to start with a Nopales salad- but none is available. Guacamole was freaking fresh though- but agree with someone else mentioning lots of chopped onions in it. My Camarones al Ajillo's were good. The hero-type bread was a bit unusual but hey...I dunked that sucker right in the garlic sauce (the hell with Keto!) and hubs liked his Chicken Fajitas with fresh veggies- down to the mushrooms. I don't mind coming back here. Seems like Mexico Lindo has a knack for serving it up real good...for this long in these parts.........despite their 3 & 1/2!.Really, REALLY, bad place. Bad service, flavorless food, limited menu. We were starving and couldn't finish the food. Very disappointed..Pretty solid vegetable fajitas served with a ton of different vegetables. I went here with friends and it's a pretty good place for groups. Location is central around the Murray hill / gramercy area. I have had better fajitas in the city, but these stand out for being very filling..I haven't eaten from here yet but ik the food is amazing because it's been around for years and I love the workers they are so sweet and I love seeing that they are still in the community . Ima eat there soon LOL.Love this little spot. The ambience was laid-back and friendly. I need to admit that I really liked Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas. All of the staff are really polite - you definitely feel welcome and taken care of. Mexico Lindo Restaurant is pretty solid."
"Nice spot , went here for lunch with my friends!!! Once I'm ever in New York I'll be sure to try here again. price - affordable Location -its New York (look for parking ) There salad actually comes with avocados, which is a plus . I definitely recommend the , steak tips and the plantain..The driver was amazing. The staff at the restaurant on the other hand was not. They didn't send my whole order. Then lied saying they did to only turn around and issue a refund for only half of the missing food. All this after I expressed this was a corporate card and I couldn't have refunds without having issues at works They could careless. I had to reach out to GH for help to get back All of my refund and write an email to corporate apologizing and explaining the problem. All this left half of the people attending this corporate meeting without food or drinks. The manager never came to the phone to speak to me directly and I could hear how rude she was in the background.  Extremely disappointed on the service I received today..This place is a hit or miss. The roasted chicken is some times burned and the favors are off. But if you don't want to cook it comes in handy..The people who work at this restaurant are extremely rude and nasty. I ordered something for delivery and misunderstood what it said on the app. I called the restaurant to ask about it and the woman who answered the phone immediately spoke to me a rude tone and said I need to read what the app says. I didn't argue because I recognized that it was a mistake so I politely asked for them to send me what I wanted and I would return what they sent me. After lecturing me about how Seamless works, she said she would send me the correct order. Some time had passed and I wanted to know the status of the order so I called back and someone picked up the phone. I explained the situation and they put someone else on the phone. This person immediately raised her voice at me as if I'm asking for free food and so I told her that she doesn't need to raise her voice at me. Then she started to again lecture me about the Seamless app and basically acted like she was doing me a favor and telling me it was my fault when all I wanted was my order. After she again started to argue with me and raise her voice, I told her to cancel the order and hung up.While I understand the initial mistake was mine, the way they responded was extremely rude and disrespectful and I've never been spoken to like that over the phone by anyone working in the food industry. I am never ordering at this establishment again. If you're going to treat your customers like shit, then your food should at least taste better. ~Las personas que trabajan en este restaurante son extremadamente groseras y desagradables. Pedí algo para la entrega y malinterpreté lo que dijo en la aplicación. Llamé al restaurante para preguntar por ello y la mujer que contestó el teléfono inmediatamente me habló un tono grosero y me dijo que necesito leer lo que dice la aplicación. No discutí porque reconocí que era un error, así que les pedí amablemente que me enviaran lo que quería y que devolvería lo que me enviaron. Después de enseñarme cómo funciona Seamless, me dijo que me mandaría la orden correcta.Había pasado algún tiempo y quería saber el estado de la orden así que llamé de nuevo y alguien cogió el teléfono. Explicé la situación y me pusieron a otra persona por teléfono. Esta persona inmediatamente levantó su voz ante mí como si estuviera pidiendo comida gratis y así le dije que no necesita levantarme la voz. Luego empezó a volver a hablarme de la aplicación Seamless y básicamente actuó como si me estuviera haciendo un favor y diciéndome que fue mi culpa cuando todo lo que quería era mi orden. Después de que ella volvió a discutir conmigo y levantó la voz, le dije que cancelara la orden y le colgué.Aunque entiendo que el error inicial fue mío, la forma en que respondieron fue extremadamente grosera e irrespetuosa y nunca me ha dicho así por teléfono nadie que trabaje en la industria alimentaria. Nunca volveré a pedir en este establecimiento. Si vas a tratar a tus clientes como una mierda, al menos tu comida debería gustar mejor..Compre un pollo rostidazo y ese fue el pollo estaba todo seco. Por el precio $12 no vale la pena..If can give -33 stars I would don't go here the Spanish lady mess my order mess up and than laugh in face don't go here nobody in this world deserves to be treated like this save your money and time and go somewhere else.So I order from this restaurant before but this time around they decided to be slick and send me bones instead of chicken. My meal was supposed to be Yello rice with chicken stew. They send me rice with chicken but these pieces of chicken where the bones part beaky any meat. Called them and they told me that all they had left. Won't even offer a refund. Never again..The food here is delish. Rotisserie chicken is soo good but I wished there were more rice options. Would love yellow rice as an option. The sweet plantains were a little soggy but still good. White rice and beans were ok. My praises are really because of the chicken. They offer multiple soda options on Grubhub but I don't think they actually have those options in the store because they delivered a soda flavor we didn't order. Overall, quick delivery and delivery guy had good customer service. There are a lot of family plan options which is perfect when you want your kids to eat something other than chicken lol.Actually the slowest place at getting food out i have ever experienced. Sort of mind boggling how inefficient it is....Got food delivery from them tonight. Delivery came faster than I respected. My lemonade (like in their menu said it is a smooties) end up just a lemonade. Fried Pork Chunk and Fried Fish is an Okey.... nothing impress."
"Best place to eat Every time I go to the Bronx I have to stop and get food from here..I do not recommend going here, the customer service is terrible. My mother is a loyal customer for many years, she goes in for a $10 order of Chicharrones, the employee is giving her a small plastic container and she politely ask for a slightly bigger plate and offers to pay for the plate. As the employee tells my mother they usual serve it in a small container the Manager out of nowhere intrudes and proceeds to yell at my mother saying if you already told her and don't listen move on to the next customer(in Spanish). Everyone stood there in shock looking at her and at my mother. That manager is extremely rude and clearly hates her job. If you do hate your job that much leave. You lost a very loyal customer, a women who has visited this restaurant for over 18 years gets this type of treatment over asking for a bigger plate. Clearly this place needs changes and should start with its disrespectful manager....Every time I order by the phone the lady treat me with very kindly and my orders are always right. I live close to the restaurant and the delivery time is faster than expected. The food quality is great, my favorite plate is Chicharrón de Pollo con hueso, I recommended!.Very good chicharrón and fried batata ,. Clean and fast service.  The juice is a bit overpriced ..5 stars for my visits !!  Yummy!! I've been here a couple times after work. I get the usual, chicharrón con tostones.. The best . Last time I went was with a group of girls on Valentines Day (yes we were all single lmao) but I had a great time. Buckets of beer were priced fairly as well as the shots of black label. The bartenders are attentive when they're not drinking, and taking pictures behind the bar lol .. Other than that, the music is great. If you wanna eat good chicharrón and dance bachata, merengue, salsa, this is it..If it was up To me they wouldn't get any stars. They sold me food with worms in it. I hope they get burned down. When I asked for the manager she got upset and had the nerve to say I just traded the food for someone else's and that I didn't buy that from there. When I just walked out of her restaurant with purchased food. They're disgusting and what's worse is that she had an attitude. I wanted to punch her in the face. Never going there again. They lost me as their customer and my friends and family that go there. Good luck to those who do eat from there..Come here for the namesake chicarron, which is sold by weight.  There are a couple of bar stools, but this is primarily a take-out place located right next to the subway.  They have a steam table, but nothing is labeled.  The counter lady patiently identified the dishes I asked about.  According to the take-out menu which I picked up on the way out, they serve various specials of the day such as pollo guisado, chivo and pernil..I selected a star because there is no other choice otherwise they wouldn't get not even one. Food is great is you go there and eat. However, according to Yelp they deliver and to make sure i called and they do. I live 1.9 miles away and when i placed my order the nasty rude woman on phone said ""you live to far i need a plane to get there so i will not drive that far. If you want to eat you are going to have to come and get it "" and just like that hanged up.Customer service is the worst i've encountered in the bronx..Really love the food from here. I do recommend this place. I'm giving them a four star because they take a very long time for delivery, but besides that I give them a.Came here one time order the Fried pork with Plantains it was really good... The staff was Polite I will come back again..."
"Little Italy is always a fun time. Caffe Napoli especially, is the hot spot for a lively crowd, music and great eats. Whether it's appetizers or dessert, there's bound to be a favorite dish to find here. This is one of my top three places to hit up whenever I want to dine in this neighborhood.Inside dining rooms feature bistro style tables and regular. There are multiple dining rooms and they even have outdoor seating for the warmer months. They are not heated when the weather gets cool so try to enjoy the al fresco option when it's available.This visit was for a snack believe it or not. I came at an off time for a full meal but after shopping and running around town, we just wanted to sit down and enjoy some small bites from a tried and true spot. In my group, party of five and everyone wanted something different as you can see from the photos. The cannoli was my guilty pleasure and I totally recommend it. My kiddo really enjoyed her rigatoni a la vodka - simply satisfying. We were also here on a cool winter's day so soup was in order. Warmed us up quick!.The cheesecake here was the best cheesecake I ever had in my life. The only downside was they kept asking if I was going to leave after we paid. I was waiting for my friend to get out of the restroom and they kept wanting me to get up and leave??? Weird..Awesome food! Attentive and friendly service! Very knowledgeable staff! Smack in the middle of Little Italy in NYC!This is truly some of the best Italian food i have had. We had the antipasto salad which was so fresh with a nice light vinegar and oil type dressing! Portion definitely for sharing!For entree the chicken cutlet with gnocchi in a vodka sauce OMG I can't even begin to describe how good it was from the perfect cook of the chicken to the creaminess of the sauce and the perfection of the gnocchi, wow i cant stop thinking about this meal!Espresso martini compliments the meal so well and the finished touch of creamy creme brûlée and the outside ambiance of Little Italy in the winter, well it was the perfect meal!.This place is delicious! I had the gnocchi with pesto and it was the best I have ever had! My husband had the panini with prosciutto and tomato. Everything was fresh and hot!.Went here for lunch a few days ago.  Either they didn't have the lunch specials or they just didn't give the lunch special menu to us.  The other guy was fine with the regular menu so I didn't make a fuss.  The bucatini amatriciana was good but overpriced at about $19.  I might come back -- but only if the lunch specials are clearly available.  Take the subway or cab to nearby Brooklyn Heights for better Italian food..Romantic street corner perfect for afternoon lemon tart, coppa pistachio and cappucinnos..This place is a joke. I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and the portion size was completely a joke and it was not even the lunch special. The staff is nice but lets go back to the portion size - it was like i ordered off the kids menu! I will not be back nor will I recommend anyone else to come here. Not if you are hungry at least.....Great food, great service, AWESOME PEOPLEThis place is hella valid would for sure recommend The service is great Italian homestyle restaurant makes u feel like your in Italy Did place a BANGERRR!.This is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC's Little Italy. It is a definite stop every time I visit the city. The food is fresh, delicious and homemade. I love to sit outside on a nice day and enjoy some wine with my delicious food. Of course I always get pasta (duh) and it never disappoints.  The prices are very reasonable too. Great value, great food, great experience always!.Wife and I stopped in for a late dinner and a couple of drinks. Wednesday night around 8:30P, only two other tables occupied at this time. Our drink order was taken quickly and brought out. At the same time we put in an order for their Spiedini Alla Romano. Wife had a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon and I one of their house drinks which was a vodka lemonade with crushed strawberries that I forget the name of. Wife loved the wine and the drink I had was good enough that I got a second.Spiedini Alla Romano was phenomenal. Prepared and plated very well.We were then treated to some very good bread.Food took an appropriate amount of time. While we waited various staff tended to our water and other needs.Wife ordered the Spaghetti Aglio and I got the Porcini Ravioli, which is one of my standard when going to a new place.Both dishes were well portioned and really really good. We ended up taking quite a bit back to the hotel. I would say the raviolis were better than average and the wife's dish was quite tasty.We did not have room for dessert but they have a full array of cakes and cannoli and such. We did get a couple of hot coffees to go and it was very good. In the end, a very nice night.Pricing is right where I expected it to be for a dinner for two in Little Italy NYC. The drinks are a tad bit steep but food prices are actually a bit lower than I come to expect. Restaurant was clean and welcoming. We were dressed casual and the setting is open but spaced appropriately. Current NY vaccination mandates were followed.Staff was very friendly. Our needs were attended to but never did I feel rushed or that i was waiting for anything. If you are looking for a spot open later on a weeknight this is definitely a go to."
"This place is so hit or miss ,but every once in a while they make a good sandwich , this turkey sandwich on a roll was 10.21$.. café prices but this place is actually a Deli..Stopped here before a mini road trip for a quick breakfast. It was just okay. I got a cinnamon raisin bagel toasted with light cream cheese. Nothing overly special with the taste of the bagel. It was filling though. Service was fast..I've never had an avocado egg bagel taste so disgusting. The Bagel with stale  and avocados were old.I have been ordering breakfast 1x a week with this establishment for around 10 years. It is usually 1 wrap with many extras . Every time I order the price changes. I never questioned it because I like the way it is prepared.When I called to order the same thing, they refused to deliver it because it was just 1 thing. With their prices ALWAYS flucuating, I was sure to get the order with no problemThen,  NASTY, RUDE, LYING girl that picked up the phone refused my order because it was one thing. When I explained I do this all the time and for an egg white, spinach and tomatoe omlette on whole wheat wrap cost me12.99 last order, and I never questioned it, she was adamant and told me no delivery.I asked to speak to manager, she said he was not in. She put me on a brief hold and then said the manager will not deluver 1 item. LIES, LIES and MORE LIES. from a very dissapointed FORMER CUSTOMER.Ordered on Uber Eats, and you could tell the bagels were microwaved before delivery! Not fresh AT ALL. Horrible.Never have I wished I could give negative starts than now. Ordered one more time. Not only are their prices more expensive than sandwiches I get at bagel stores in Manhattan. Not only are their sandwiches thinner than any bagel sandwich I've ever gotten, but this is the only store that up charges me AFTER I've placed the order and doesn't even tell you why. Their sandwiches are crap, their prices are ABSURD, they are deceitful  with their prices. Not only that, but every single time I've gone into the store itself, they have made errors (in their favor) when ringing me up. STAY AWAY, and if not, make sure you check your bill. THEY ARE THIEVES!!!!.THIEVES! Every single time I have gone there, they charge me for extra items. Not only that, their bagel sandwiches  are chintzy, as are their special cream cheeses. This place used to be great back when they first opened around the corner and there was less competition. Now their prices have gone up and their quality and customer service down. Go to the Gourmet Bagel Shoppe on Avenue U instead..This place has some nerve...they are ridiculously OVERPRICED! I asked for a bagel with just lettuce and tomato. The girl rings it up and says $6.50! I asked how is that possible, she said she could only ring it up as an avocado sandwich. I said yes, but I didn't get avocado, I only got lettuce and  tomato, which on a sandwich is like 50 cents extra for each. She asks her boss, Rob, and he says yeah that's ok. So I called his name and I said, really? He said avocado in the computer is the closest thing to lettuce and tomato!! ARE YOU FOR REAL! Avocado is expensive, lettuce isn't. He turns his back on me and mutters, ""produce is expensive"". Obviously I walked out. I then went to Bagel Bob, got the same sandwich and was charged $3.00!!!!!STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE, he is the worst businessman!!.SUPER NASTY REGISTER GIRLS. they are like high school idiots who talk nasty to you and disrespectful. They need to change them out. I been there 2-3 times recently and they are always nasty. As if they are forced to work there. Also bagels are super dry and inedible but mostly won't be coming back because of the girls mostly.These are my absolute favorite bagels. Every single time I'm in the area, I will always get my bagels from here. They are the perfect New York style bagel that is perfectly chewy and full bodied. Their whole wheat everything bagels are the best of all and are a must try. They also make very good bagel and lox sandwiches and their scallion cream cheese is delicious. I am really glad that they finally switched their containers over to more eco-friendly options. They used to use styrofoam, but now only use paper and recyclable plastic.While they do currently have a little table set up right outside their shop, this isn't the type of place you sit and eat at..Super stale, dry bagels and flagels. Good fixings and they got the order right, but the bagels weren't fresh at all so I basically couldn't eat the sandwich. Won't even going back."
"This place was awesome, when we first walk in all eyes were on us, the waiter came to seat us, he said take the table in the middle, and we wondered why!!??but it was a pleasure,the company was wonderful, the food was delicious and everything overall was great/ excellent the service was immaculate, I will definitely go back there we will definitely do , it's now our new Italiano place/ home  , I will definitely recommend this place all day everyday!!!!!.Il Nocello is a hidden gem in Whitestone that serves some of the best Italian food you can get! Everything is so fresh and the service is great and fast. I went here with my parents last night during the hurricane, and it still was pretty crowded despite the bad weather.I got the chicken parm (my all time favorite dish) and this place has some of the best chicken parm you can find... even have some leftovers for lunch today I can't wait! My dad LOVES the veal here and always says how its some of the best he's ever had. Mom got shrimp scampi and loved every bite. Definitely check this place out for dine-in or take-out. Great for large groups and private events!.Me and my boyfriend love this place! We literally eat here three times per week. The branzino over spinach with Penne alla vodka is outstanding!! Best Italian food in Whitestone. This restaurant is never a disappointment no matter what you order..Not impressed. The food was pretty good but this place is not a moderately priced place and more like $30 a plate. That's totally fine with me but the service absolutely did not match.  Their menu prices online are way outdated and showed more of a $13-$17 range and this is not accurate.  The servers were poor. They left our table a mess, grabbed things without asking if we were finished (we weren't), forgot my father in laws side sauce, walked off in the middle of questions, never asked during the meal if everything was ok and then after we paid they came back to try to snatch the tip before we had even had a chance to finish our drinks.  At these types of restaurants with cloth on the table a proper waiter will generally use a crumb cleaner to quickly sweep off crumbs..and the bread was VERY messy and crusty (but good) so that should have been standard.  The staff was just rude and poorly mannered (awful etiquette and need to learn how to properly speak to customers) and I saw other unfortunate customers mention (in their reviews) that race comes into play.  I'm white and my husband and in-laws are all Hispanic. Best part is that ALL the staff were Hispanic. I observed MAJOR differences in how other non-minority tables were treated during this visit. What a shame.  My husband and I make close to half a million a year and the $200 meal would have been a standard $60 tip from us had they just been decent. I left a small tip but they really didn't even deserve that.  My in laws (and it seems many minorities) are apparently used to this racism and classism but I am not and it's disgusting and I won't stand for it.  Businesses are struggling post pandemic and people are much tighter on money to spend (in general) so you'd think businesses would be breaking their backs to give good service. It really isn't that hard to be nice and have good manners. We were an easy going party with no special requests and this dining experience fell short.  I gave 3 stars because the food was all pretty tasty, however..For those that are born and bred from Whitestone (like myself) we've always have been that 'nicer neighborhood' that never had the best restaurants, bars, cafe, etc. (hence going into Astoria and Bayside all the time). That's slowly starting to change and Il Nocello is a great example of that.I was back in the hood for an unexpected visit and my dad and I heard some neighbors chattering about this place and gave it a whirl. Very solid across the board. For starters, this place is smack dab in the middle of the 'village' so while it's easy to get to, parking can be tricky, depending on the time of day. The dining room is basically takes up the entire space of the restaurant (so probably not the best place for a special event or something) but the seating was very comfortable and the wait staff was top notch.The menu was your standard issue Italian-American type of selection. We opted for the hot antipasto for 2, which was a solid B overall but they just put too much marinara on everything. I went for the branzino which was VERY good and the sauteed spinach was done perfectly. My dad had the veal francaise and loved it too. We washed it all down with a carafe of white wine. Perhaps the reason for the 4 stars on my end is the price. Granted, branzino isn't cheap but for 2 people, a karafe of wine and a shared app and you're paying over $100, including tip?! I can get a higher end meal that cost that much at a snazzier place. I'll be back though! A great addition to our hood!.My boyfriend and I strolled in on a random Tuesday night. We weren't planning on going in but I'm glad we did! Food was delicious and service was great. We had the baked clams, eggplant parm, and veal capricciosa. Will definitely be back!.Surprisely very good for a little place in whitestone! The lunch special is fantastic. $14.95 for an app, meal, dessert and drink. (No ETOH included.) Definitely will come back or order take out. The chicken soup was fantastic and like home-made! Linguine with clams was great! Al-dente! And the pork chop was delicious! Try this little gem..This place needs a makeover. It has a lot of regulars and Whitestone doesn't have much to offer in the restaurant department, so I see why they are still around. Service is stellar,but that's the only thing that's stellar. Again, very,very mediocre food. Last time I was there, the food was so bland, I had to put a ton of salt. We will still go there just because you can't go to the same restaurant all the time..First let me start by saying we say down for 10 minutes before we even got a menu. We literally had to ask for them!When we ordered fried calamari for our appetizer we asked for marina sauce and fra diablo sauce on the side, the waiter brought only marinara we asked for the other one 5 minutes later he comes back with the same marinara on the side and red pepper flakes and I guess that was their version of the fra diablo?Food is ok, service is absolutely horrible. If you see the locals from Whitestone normally get over the top treatment instead we had a very bad experience! Do not recommend  everyone else got their food before us, people that came before us got their appetizer and their main course!!! not to play the race card but if you look at the other negative reviews you can clearly see if your not white do not eat here BEWARE !!.IL Nocello Ristorante you are truly fantastic, I had a lovely experience here today. IL Nocello Ristorante is a total gem of a find. Eggplant Rollatini was really great, I wanted to order everything off their menu, but glad that I got Eggplant Rollatini. Good selection and fabulous customer service. But, seriously. IL Nocello Ristorante - Really, really good.."
"Was in the area and got hungry. Decided to grab a quick bite to go. Everything looked great. Got the bacon burger to go. Service was quick. Burger was a bit messy to eat as the burger was huge! It was very juicy. Staff was friendly. There are some tables available if you choose to dine in. Would love to try the fried chicken if I'm back in the hood again..Horrible. Can't bother to get the order right. Looking for some good food? Skip this place..Quite frankly the previous reviews are appalling however, when I stopped in a few months ago I had no issues. I ordered spicy chicken wings with mozzarella sticks. I had to wait ten minutes for my order to be fulfilled because they ran out of wings. The food was tasty. The wings were spicy and reminiscent of Popeyes spicy chicken wings. The mozzarella sticks were crispy on the outside yet moist with gooey goodness on the inside. I'd come back..Their burgers are just wow specially Texas hell burger and double cheese burger. The chicken menus are quite average as well as their taste . Disappointed with the drinks collection. Fast customer service. Moderately recommended!.Their burgers are just wow specially Texas hell burger and double cheese burger. The chicken menus are quite average as well as their taste . Disappointed with the drinks collection. Fast customer service. Moderately recommended..Well I came because I was craving food and I've always pondered what the food is like at close to  1AM after missing the Q40. I ordered the Tex Box which came with either 2 tenders or 2 pieces of chicken, I decided to get the later; along with it was a small fountain drinK, warm cookIe and fries included a big packet of ranch dressing I requested which was free unlike at Popeyes..I found out about this place from my  coworker it   has been about 2 weeks and I cannot stop going. it never fails, me the customer service is great the food is great. I live in the gym for nothing because I go to this place on my days off...The spicy chicken sandwich was delicious. I got it with bacon, and pepper jack cheese. You gotta try it. Idk what else to say. Just try this sandwich. You'll love it. Oh and the bacon is crispy not soggy.We ordered 50 pieces of fried chicken- 40 spicy 10 regular and they said ""okay it'll be ready at 4:30"". We come at 4:30 and they say 20 more minutes. We come at 5 and they say 10 more minutes. They give us 30 regular and 10 spicy. This is the wrong order. Then they say oh sorry the rest is cooking. We wait 10 more minutes, it's 5:22 and then they give us 10 more spicy. Our order was 40 spicy and 10 regular but they give us 30 regular and 20 spicy and it is 50 minutes late...Nice new chicken spot, a bit more pricey than crown fried around the corner. But they make up for it with class and taste. Not to mention better location. ( no stinky fish two doors down). Like them so far hope they keep up the service and overall food quality.I waited 20-25 minutes for a simple fried chicken order while 5 people in front of me, who came after me, got their foods and left. The order was two pieces of chicken and it was premade and right in front of me, yet I was ignored and disrespected by being ignored while others received their orders. This is unacceptable and I felt incrediblly degraded as the staff joked around with others in front of me and did not complete my order on time. It does NOT TAKE 20-25 minutes for premade chicken that was already cooling on the racks. Unacceptable."
"Fun little spot.  Went for a birthday party and stayed for around 2 1/2 hours.   It was refreshing to walk out of a busy without tinnitus!   I think the best way to describe the Pour House is that it's not trying to be something it's not.Good selection of clean, cold draft beers.   I always appreciate a place which takes the time to clean out their beer and soda lines.  Thanks for a good time, Pour House!.Fun little spot.  Went for a birthday party and stayed for around 2 1/2 hours.   It was refreshing to walk out of a busy bar without tinnitus!   I think the best way to describe the Pour House is that it's not trying to be something it's not.Good selection of clean, cold draft beers.   I always appreciate a place which takes the time to clean out their beer and soda lines.  Thanks for a good time, Pour House!.Just a quick viewpoint about this rather comfortable local bar in Bay Ridge.  I stop in here every now and again for a pint or three with friends or just on the occasion when a getaway is necessary from the outside world.  There is a great choice of your standard beers along with the occasional surprise that might be in stock and if you are just looking for a good regular bar then this is the place for you.  For the times that I have dropped in I found a nice assortment of Rock being played and I guess this is more based on the working bartender but its nothing I would ever argue about.  Price wise its very reasonable and if you need a no frills hang then do stop in, I am sure they'd love the visit.  There is no food on hand and I cannot speak to their policy if patrons wish to bring something in.  It cannot hurt to ask..Good cheap drinks in a classic bar feel. Despite being an old school bar it does have big open windows so it's not a cave. They also have darts if that's your thing..Pretty unremarkable Ridge bar, but its never boring. There are no seats (my biggest complaint) despite being a biggish space. Dedicated crowd, lots of regulars, super busy when school lets out on Friday. The darts haven't hit anyone yet; this is rather amazing, given how packed it gets Thurs-Sat. Pretty good music, heavy on the 90s. They really need to clean the taps more often, and some of the regulars are sloppy and annoying. Been here my whole life, and I still dunno what people are looking for here. But I suspect I'm not the target audience. Maybe you are, try it out..When I came in here last week I got great attention and service... the bartender was very friendly and welcoming, he made some magnificent cocktails.Bars are not for judging, they are for relaxing. Either your family or with friends. Friends become family. The Pour House is a fun family feel, stay a minute you make a friends. Come back often you become family. Beer is cold drinks are well made. You have to work in this world to fit or to cast aside. Work to have fun and learn laugh. Judge not as thee.... Great place.My friend and I stopped in on Saturday night after noticing it wasn't as crowded as other bars in the area. There was plenty of room to move around, a nice beer selection and attentive bartenders. The atmosphere was inviting and pretty laid back. We did realize later on that they do not serve food, so make sure you do not walk in on an empty stomach. Other than that, we had a good time and would definitely drop in again..Went here for a quick drink after dinner with bf and friends. The staffs were very nice and friendly. Asked for Guinness but the tap wasnt working. Settled for just regular Corona. They have 2 dart boards you can play for free. Restroom is pretty clean too..I am a fan of this bar. When I feel a little dancy and I don't want to go all the way into the city ... or to Salty, I go to Pour House. If you are from Ridge you'll end up seeing people who you went to kindergarten with, but no one cares. It has a relatively large crowds on weekends. The music is heavy on the 90's, which is so much fun, I am talking like great throw backs.  I was here on a monday with a friend a few weeks ago and it was quiet... well not quiet there was a dart league going on and they were very lively! I had no idea there were such things like a dart league..I been here just that one time.. And I was treated as I was there for years! The staff is super friendly and welcoming.. The crowds is nice also friendly drinkers.. I stayed late and enjoy my time. To come again when in town! Keep it up guys!"
"Cozy wine bar with an excellent selection of wine by the glass and bottle. Their menu is perfect for light bites and pairings-- the staff is also super knowledgeable. Black Mountain is great for both social gatherings or sitting and reading and enjoying a quiet moment. This place is a gem..Vibrant and super cute ambience. It looks like a hole in the wall but has a lot to offer. To start with the vibe is great, wine collection Is decent and the appetizers (at least the ones we tried) are bomb. Highly recommend you try Tete de moine cheese and roasted tomatoes with Parmesan with bread.Carby yet healthy and delicious bar food that  complements the good selection of wines.Do visit if you are hanging around in the neighborhood..One of my favorite places of all time. I discovered it by accident, ten years ago, because it was between the subway and my music lessons and I needed a little something for dinner. Good wine, good wine-friendly foods, attentive servers and when the fireplace is on it's the perfect cozy atmosphere. I've considered moving to this neighborhood just because of Black Mountain. And in the warmer months with the outdoor option and the flowers in bloom it is absolutely charming.Also the playlist is usually very good, and matches the funky but cozy atmosphere perfectly.I love the goat cheese tart..This place is so unassuming you could easily miss it but it's so cute. I'm so lucky to call this my neighborhood wine bar.Loves:+ Cozy atmosphere. It's a little log cabin that decided to grace Gowanus.+ So many delicious wines to choose from ranging from $9-15+ Good food pairings to go with the wine (eg. charcuterie $16, pork meatballs $14, and our fave the chocolate bread pudding $9) + Shoutout to the best server, Ryan! :) The space can get very busy and reservations are not accepted, but the wait is worth it. I am already looking forward to my next visit..""I really need to stop in there sometime."" -me every time I biked or drove by in the past decadeFinally did! First of all, super glad they survived... well, everything.Came by a bit early on a Friday, which was a good choice because the outdoor seating filled up fast. Sat in a little parklette on Hoyt.Great wine menu (duh), including skin contact oranges.Also had some light bites, including some charcuterie - a salume board, cheese, and some olives. Quite delightful.And of course, if there's one place to describe the inside of this place, it's ""cozy"". Walls lined with bottles. Fireplace in the corner. Some real mood lighting.I'll definitely be back!.Get the salt cod!!! It was absolutely delicious and super worth going back for over and over. This place has great outdoor seating with comfy patio chairs that recline nicely - a good place to sit and talk and have a drink/snacks. My friend and I shared the salt cod which was sooo good. We also got the goat cheese tart - that was ok but not that memorable, I'd get something else next time (and I say this as a lover of goat cheese but it was really just ok). Service was friendly. I'll definitely be back to get the salt cod again and try something new!.Spotted this gem on Yelp before we even landed in Brooklyn. Cozy yet sophisticated vibes, we downed all of our small plates, charcuterie, pea soup, Brussel sprout/kale salad and goat cheese crostini. Yum, yum, yum. If there's one area of opportunity it would be to go one higher on the wine list. Some choices were predictable and accessible elsewhere rather than new discoveries I delight in at a wine bar. Honestly, tho, I loved this place so much that ultimately I still highly, highly recommend..This place is great! The bean toast dish we had was really tasty, but the highlights were the staff's excellent recommendations. I know nothing about wine, but I feel like I would come back to BMWH to learn more! Great place to go after a long work day for sure!.Absolutely chuffed to have visited this glorious spot. It was perfect t for a freezing Friday night. Fantastic wine list at agreeable prices. My friend and I shared the baked Brie and apples, kale and Brussels salad, butternut squash soup and goat cheese/beet/potato/salad masterpiece. Perfect sharing sizes. Our server was so kind to oblige a request to split the soup in 2 bowls, which was so appreciated. The crackling fire place warmed my hands AND my heart. This is definitely an intimate setting, most suited for groups of two - maybe 3 max. A lovely place I can't wait to visit again!.Visited Black Mountain Wine House on Saturday afternoon. An excellent wine bar that manages to provide a cozy space to enjoy their selection of wines.Quality: Black Mountain Wine House is my kind of wine bar. First, I love that nearly every wine on the menu is available by the glass, and the few that aren't can be ordered as half bottles. I very rarely know what I want from the start, so making it convenient to try before you buy, without feeling bad for turning it down, is a huge plus. Second, the wine menu is expansive, but not overwhelming. They clearly chopped down on options, so it is not pages long, but still with enough diversity in terms of styles. Third, is a simple food menu that is focused on compliments to wine rather than full meals. The House Marinated Olives were a perfect bite, while the Charcuterie Plate with soppressata, capicola, chorizo, and salami, and the Cheese Plate with manchego, capri, and formage d'affinois, were a little more substantial snack. And finally is the wonderful space. Both inside and out, it is set up as a cozy little cabin, perfect for enjoying a glass of wine.Quantity: We only ordered small bites, but there are a few more substantial items on the menu.Value: $5 for the House Marinated Olives. $15 for the Charcuterie Plate. $15 for a Cheese Plate. $8-$15 for Glasses of Wine.Ambiance: Black Mountain Wine House is located in the Gowanus area of Brooklyn. It is not on a main stretch, and when closed it does not look like much. But when they have the fire pit going out front with piles of wood and folks gathered around, it is such an inviting image. They have expanded the outdoor space for COVID, with additional seating on the sidewalks, and now have a few tables open inside. And while it was not going during our visit, they have a fireplace indoors as well. It is small, it is rustic, and it is comfortable. Crowd: On a beautiful day in winter, it was not surprising to see this place fill up quickly. The fire pit is the prized area, but nearly every table inside and out was filled by late afternoon.Service: Our server was excellent and did not hold back his opinions on wines, which is great. He was also excited to break out a wine that had been missing from the menu, which was right up our alley.Parking: Street parking can be found in the area."

"I waited a while to review this Dunkin D because some branches try it, no consistency! One week they're sweet as ice tea the next they pour hot cappuccino all over your face ( exaggeration). This DD is fine, nothing ill to report here (lol) carry along. Staff is nice. They open early but promptly shut at 9pm or quarter to when they gently nudge you out. They do their best to keep the place clean. I've become fast friends with one of the worker's nine year old and him and I chat our faces off when we meet on evenings. Though technically he's not a member of staff, I've observed him open the door for customers or even wipe it if he thinks it looks dirty. This is a true testimony to how awesome his mum who IS a member of staff here is, he's an extension of her so I felt I could include my lil homie in my review. The only bad is location. On Fulton street the boys (old men but childish behavior so yes BOYS) that hang out in front this establishment harasses women and young ladies as they walk in or pass by. They don't try that mess with me because my beast face is always ready and quiet as it's kept my tongue can be sharp. I like this branch a lot. The End..Poor customer service. Worst dunkin franchise I've ever went to. Walked in and the cashier literally stood at the expresso machine pulling at prongs. He makes eye contact with me then pulled a lookaway to appear busy. It was not until I said ""I know you just saw me"" that he finally comes forward to ask my order. Wtf ... I asked for hot pumpkin latte then he says the machine is all cleaned. I ask ""what time y'all close?""7:45Mind you it's 7:07. I had enough turned on my heeled cowgirl boots and sashayed out the door. I hate my time and presence being wasted in any establishment.This Dunkin is legitimately the worst Dunkin I've ever seen in my entire life. Apart from the fact that it's always dirty the service sucks and all the employees hate their lives. Unfortunately it's right downstairs from my job so I have no choice but I'm late everyday because they take forever. Sometimes they get my order wrong and other times their system is down. Sometimes they're all huddled together doing nothing. A hot fucking mess I'm annoyed..First- the staff is good.  They're nice and helpful- no issues with the staff. The problem is they NEED TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE!!!  This store is so slow.  I stop by every now and then on my way to work, around the corner, and I don't even walk in anymore if I see there's a line in the morning.  The person that runs the register also has to make the drinks and occasionally get the food.  There's one person in the back actually making the food.  They really just need more people.  I've turned around and walked out several times because it takes so long with that few people on staff.  If it weren't for the shortage of staff, which cases the long wait, I would really like the location.  Management, if you read these reviews: Please hire more people at least during the morning rush hours..Manager and staff are super friendly! Manager is always helpful, and trying to make dunkin be the best! Alot of unwelcomed crowds hang there which makes it a little skeevey, other then that i love this location.Horrible service. Two weeks ago I was trying to ask the cashier that I wanted to put some money in my DD app, but he chose not to listen to me and kept asking what I wanted. After I placed the order, I told him again about reloading my account and he got upset and responded with an attitude that I should've told him before ordering! My hot coffee was not hot at all, but I didn't want to ruin my day by interacting further with this individual.Yesterday, came here with a friend and hoped the experience would be different. I was wrong- this time the cashier was a woman with the same bad attitude and disrespect. She wouldn't use words, just hand gestures to communicate and put her hand (palm) in front of me to cut me off while I was placing my order. She then used as little words as possible, to tell me that my coupon was not valid. She didn't give me a second to respond and started taking someone else's order, skipping my friend, who was right next to me. At this point I cut her off and told her that my friend was also going to order. She was refusing to listen, but finally took both of our orders. We don't plan on coming here again..Well, it is Dunkin' Donuts, a fast food chain.  I once had to call after realizing while at work in upper Manhattan, that they had given me the wrong change.  It wasn't a small amount either.  But thankfully, they were able to review the cameras and see that I wasn't given what I was supposed to (however, that worked exactly), and I was able to pick it up that afternoon.  Another time, dude told me he couldn't make my ice coffee dark with just a bit of cream because it was pre-measured.  I calmly informed him that's how I always get my coffee from that very Dunkin' Donuts.  He grumbled about it, but then made it how I had asked.  Others that work their are sweet or at least neutral.  There are usually random folks hanging around, but hey, it's on Fulton Street after all.I got here when I want some decent, cheap coffee, and it serves that purpose..Clean, fast with a takeout window for early mornings with my dog.  The coffee is good, and the sandwiches are greasy tasty.  Hey, you always know what you're getting when you come here!.If I could give zero stars I would. The young woman behind the counter is bizarre. During my first few encounters with her I let it slide thinking she was having a bad day, but it's apparent something is off with her. She is consistently rude and angry, as if she doesn't want you there at all! Today I was right in front of her and she literally looked past me and above my head at nothing for long enough for it to be awkward. It was very obviously on purpose, maybe to get a reaction? Honestly, she's so bizarre I can't even be offended. She was looking past me making doe eyes at an older man who didn't even buy anything and seemed to be just hanging out. As I sat to drink my coffee I also noticed she was equally dismissive to every woman in line, but smiley & flirting with the men aged 17-70. It was unnerving to see her go from sullen to big smile depending on the customers gender. A bit scary even. I can't make this up.I understand personality disorders or serious, but being outright hostile and dismissive to every woman in the place and fawning over every man is not good for business. It's discriminatory and unprofessional. This girl has an obvious problem with women and possibly some disorder where she's obsessed with male attention. I wouldn't be surprised if her parents gave her this job to keep an eye on her and/or because she couldn't hold a job anywhere else..Terrible experience. Seemed like employees were more worried about having ""funny moments"" than serving customers. Cook tried to get me to take a shot of vanilla syrup, trying to convince me it was coffee. The cash register attendant laughed. Unfortunately for them I wasn't at Dunkin for a comedy skit, just coffee. I live right down the street, and love DD, but will never consume another dollar at this location..Disgusting. I would give it 0 stars if I could. The woman behind the counter was so rude. She seemed so incompetent. I had to repeat my self 4 times on a simple order. She was very rude and seemed so off. I ordered an egg & cheese on a bagel after 5 min waiting for the bagel I find out the bagels aren't ready- it's like 7 AM how don't they have bagels but besides the point I get a croissant instead. So i pull it out to eat it and there's a huge thick black hair. Literally disgusting. Hair in my food, rude employees and I just got a horrible vibe. 100% will not return."
"I haven't had tacos this fresh in a very long time. The manager/cook Alex is super friendly and he makes a hell of a burrito. I can't say enough good things about this gem. I wish I lived in the area, because it's one of best small scale Mexican restaurants I've been to.I wouldn't exactly say the decor is charming, but there's something authentic about the place. It's just a place where actual Mexicans would go to appreciate the food and the atmosphere. There's been late nights when the jukebox is pumping out some festive Tejano music and the beer is flowing and the customers at the bar are really enjoying themselves..Just FYI, Luna's appears to have closed a while back; we're unsure if it's moved. :(.Luna's has wonderful Mexican food, the best we've found in NYC so far. That it's just down the street from us is a huge bonus. I tried the enchiladas suizas with beef but would try it with chicken next time, it lends itself better to that I think. The tangy sauce and three enchiladas, rice and beans meant I waddled out of there stuffed. The chips and salsa served before dinner were authentic and tasty too. I have yet to find a bag of chips like those, not even from my other fave (read: cheaper) place which has fresh tortillas.We tried to go Sunday for lunch but they were closed - we were crestfallen. Thumbs up for the food. Decor is minimal but clean, and the bar has a great selection of tequilas according to my guy's eye; we haven't tried them all - yet. Prices are good, normal for the area but not super cheap like my other fave place. The service was good. Can't wait to have dinner at Luna's again soon..I'm not positive this is the exact address but it's just West of Gino's Pizza. It's a hole-in-the-wall Mexican place that's REAL Mexican. As a West-Coaster I lament the number of real Mexican places in the city and this is one that makes me feel a little better.Atmosphere's not much but the food's excellent (complete with Mexican tacos-the soft ones with steak not ground beef or try the enchiladas suizas which are to die for) and super cheap. They also do take-out/delivery. Right off the GRV train it's a worth the trip out of the city for price and quality..I lived off of Luna's enchiladas for three years.  Anytime I was hungry and needed comfort food, Luna's came to the rescue.  When I go back to visit my friends in Astoria I order in from here.  I love it..My go to Mexican in the neighborhood.  Sure, they have the Tacos, Burritos, and Enchiladas when you crave.  But they also have an extensive menu with more complicated Entrees.  The quality is better than most in the area.  My only gripe is that it doubles as a somewhat dingy looking Bar.  On a busy night it's not the most pleasant place for a sit down meal.  But, that's why god invented take out..This place was everything I wanted it to be for a late Sunday night dinner.  I had the carne asada tacos and my boyfriend had the enchiladas.  The tacos were plentiful and the meat was tasty.  The enchiladas had just enough cheese and weren't overly saucy.  The guac needed more salt, but there's a shaker on the table so all's forgiven.  The chips and salsa that were brought out to start the meal were really good.  The decor isn't worth much, but it's cheap and yummy and open late..ehhh... not the worst Mexican I've ever had but not the best, especially in Astoria/LIC area.  My two friends and I each ordered different menu items and none of us were particularly impressed..Being from California, I have pretty high standards when it comes to Mexican food, and this place is a solid choice.  I was first introduced to Luna's through my boyfriend, an honest-to-goodness Mexican himself.  He has even higher standards than I do, and swears by the burritos at this place.  Delivery is fast, the folks who work there are really nice, and the food is quite good.  It's not as good as back home but hey, that's New York.  It's one of the better Mexican joints that I've found here though, and I've been looking for a number of years..This place has awesome Mexican food...their food is perfectly seasoned and decent sizes, not dripping with cheese and sauce like other places. We were looking for a place on Cinco de Mayo and came here, which is close to our apartment. I got the enchiladas and my husband got a burrito. Both amazing and served with rice and beans. The guacamole was delicious (I judge Mexican places on their guac)! We also had some fantastic margaritas. All in all, a great night. One thing I didn't like...I couldn't finish my dinner and asked for it to go. The waitress took is back to the kitchen and never brought it back and I forgot to ask before we left. It would've been an awesome lunch the next day. :-(.Love Lunas! The nachos are great and so are the beef tacos. Delivery is quick!"
"This is the best Mexican place in New York!  It took a little while to run into it, but once I  did it became a Jimmy-staple.  Get the Enchiladas Banderas!  They're awesome!PS:  When I moved away in the summer of '07, they changed their name to ""La Luna."""
"I had resorted to this restaurant because the other restaurant that I had intended to visit in the area was closed since it was later in the evening. However, I had not eaten for hours so I didn't want to leave Sheepshead Bay on an empty stomach so I requested lamb adana over rice and ezme and cherry nectar. The wait time was minimal and I had discovered that no indoor seating and eating on premises was permitted. With that said, the staff called my number and the entire meal was neatly situated in one bag. The lamb adana was tender with a nice combination of savory and charred flavor. The rice seemed to be evenly cooked, but leaning toward the softer/gummy side which is good (in my opinion) because it mixed well with the garnishments. The ezme was situated in a separated container, but it was tangy/spicy with somewhat sweet undertones. Therefore, I consumed it with the included bread which was softer rather than crunchy/caramelized. I provided a 5-star rating because the staff were nice enough to hold the cherry nectar that I had forgotten to take with me so I simply returned and stated my previous order number to which I had discovered was located on the counter without any issues..This place USED to be ok, however, lately the food I purchase from them is not acceptable... and it's time I go to the myriad of better Turkish Restaurants in the area (Kings Highway alone has three nearby).  For example, I just ordered from Annotolian tonight about 10pm.... within 30 seconds after I ordered and paid the cashier, my number was called (I thought it was kind of weird, because it was too quick of time to make the gyro sandwich I ordered).  I live only 5 minutes away, and sure enough, as soon as I got home I opened my sandwich to find the gyro meat was COLD.... it was obvious I was served meat that was already cut off the gyro and sitting their rather than being made a fresh sandwich with warm lamb meat.  For the price you pay, you could take your business to the local competitors who will actually have the decency to serve you fresh cut meat that is warm, rather than cold meat that has been sitting out in the open already cut.  Been going here for years, but their service and food has been so awful lately, my peers and I will be going to the Turkish spots on Kings Highway for now on.... it is a little further from me, but at least I know I won't be served cold lamb meat that has already been cut off the gyro and sitting on the bottom just waiting for a customer like me to disappoint.  Stay away!!! You have been warned.UPDATE:  Not only was the meat served cold, but half of it was also burnt/charred.  So if you like the meat on your gyro to be both charred and cold (as if it was found on the floor behind an oven), Anatolian is for you!.The food was pretty mediocre, and overall my experience was not pleasant. My food was packed in a way such that everything leaked. Also the prices are kind of expensive. Please just go to a halal cart if you want good gyros and lamb..Second favorite after Taci Beyti in the surrounding area! Food is deliciousss. There's a separate counter for picking up food on the left of the entrance so head over thereLamb Gyro Platter $12.50/small: what really works for me here is the appropriately seasoned meat. Usually, the gyro meat from other places tend to opt out of the salt/seasoning so that the white sauce really stands out, but makes the star of the show bland by itself. That's a no no for me, since I don't always use the white sauce haha. Here, it's flavorful and salty enough, and perfectly tender and juicy slabs of meat. After devouring the entire plate, I was already regretting not ordering a large - that's how much I enjoyed. The pita bread that came with the entrée was also outstanding. Normally I'm disappointed by the flat and limp pitas, but this was as big as the takeout container and extremely pretty. I ate the bread two days later and it was still so soft and fluffy. Now imagine eating that fresh!.They messed up my Take out order! On top of that i get a nasty attitude when i returned the food at the store. Very inconsiderate staff..For $10, the kunefe was smaller than I expected. It's sweet on the outside but there's cheese inside. The combination is alright but it definitely does not taste good AT ALL when you don't eat it hot. The cheese gets cold and the outside gets soggy. You can't make out the different flavors anymore at that point..Craving meat on rice with grilled flavor. This spot is so busy for good reason. Their skewers r plentiful, made to order, hours fresh- you can tell by the amount of food they push out vs. 10 men behind the counter cooking and prepping the food and the never ending clanging of the doors and ringing of phones. Phew. Standing in the organized chaos for 20 mins was hectic. But worth it. Pricey but worth it. Sizable hunks of grilled beef 2x2 inches of expertly marinaded and fire roasted yumminess..Ok.., ok....1st. The delivery  driver went to the wrong address, when he     called me.2nd. When I got my order the ( Chicken Gyro ) there were no    Cucumbers.., only 1 THINLY SLICE of a supposedly tomato.   hardly ANY ONION'S....   3rd. I got only  2 little .5oz  Cucumber Sauce containers which    probably was smaller than a tea spoon of Cucumber Sauce..I guess I forgot how much I didn't like this place. So I placed a grubhub order and when I went to pick it up the girl tells me the order never went through, although I showed her the receipt (my card was charged). She told me to wait while she spoke to one of the guys who was probably a manager. 10 minutes later I asked if my food was being made and they tell me ""no it didn't go through"". I was straight up it ignored while waiting for food I paid for. Was not helped in any way to either get a refund or the food. Walked out and disputed with grubhub. Insane..The food here is decent but not the best. I typically get the chicken gyro over rice but I feel like the quality has gone down. The chicken is cooked well and moist but lacks flavor, as does the rice. I find myself drowning the food in sauce in order to get more taste to it. I always order a shepard salad with my large gyro platter. The problem is that they include the salad in the ""large"" container, and it ends up taking up half the space. This makes the large platter significantly smaller, and I don't believe you end up getting any more rice and chicken than in a small platter. For the price, they should serve the salad on the side. Also, the shepard salad itself is lackluster. It is actually just tomatoes and cucumbers chopped too large. Not sure if there was any dressing on it but if so, not enough. No feta cheese on the salad either. Overall, edible but probably not worth it. Overpriced for the portions and quality in my opinion..This place never ever disappoints! It's very easy to place your order over the phone or on their website and the staff is always kind when you come to pick up the food!My SO and I love to share one chicken gyro platter and lamb gyro platter because I really think it's the yummiest dishes they have. Great, consistent quality & flavor! The pita it comes with is literally to die for and if you really love yourself grab a hummus appetizer... you'll thank me later"

Their skewers r plentiful, made to order, hours fresh- you can tell by the amount of food they push out vs. 10 men behind the counter cooking and prepping the food and the never ending clanging of the doors and ringing of phones. Phew. Standing in the organized chaos for 20 mins was hectic. But worth it. Pricey but worth it. Sizable hunks of grilled beef 2x2 inches of expertly marinaded and fire roasted yumminess..Ok.., ok....1st. The delivery  driver went to the wrong address, when he     called me.2nd. When I got my order the ( Chicken Gyro ) there were no    Cucumbers.., only 1 THINLY SLICE of a supposedly tomato.   hardly ANY ONION'S....   3rd. I got only  2 little .5oz  Cucumber Sauce containers which    probably was smaller than a tea spoon of Cucumber Sauce..I guess I forgot how much I didn't like this place. So I placed a grubhub order and when I went to pick it up the girl tells me the order never went through, although I showed her the receipt (my card was charged). She told me to wait while she spoke to one of the guys who was probably a manager. 10 minutes later I asked if my food was being made and they tell me ""no it didn't go through"". I was straight up it ignored while waiting for food I paid for. Was not helped in any way to either get a refund or the food. Walked out and disputed with grubhub. Insane..The food here is decent but not the best. I typically get the chicken gyro over rice but I feel like the quality has gone down. The chicken is cooked well and moist but lacks flavor, as does the rice. I find myself drowning the food in sauce in order to get more taste to it. I always order a shepard salad with my large gyro platter. The problem is that they include the salad in the ""large"" container, and it ends up taking up half the space. This makes the large platter significantly smaller, and I don't believe you end up getting any more rice and chicken than in a small platter. For the price, they should serve the salad on the side. Also, the shepard salad itself is lackluster. It is actually just tomatoes and cucumbers chopped too large. Not sure if there was any dressing on it but if so, not enough. No feta cheese on the salad either. Overall, edible but probably not worth it. Overpriced for the portions and quality in my opinion..This place never ever disappoints! It's very easy to place your order over the phone or on their website and the staff is always kind when you come to pick up the food!My SO and I love to share one chicken gyro platter and lamb gyro platter because I really think it's the yummiest dishes they have. Great, consistent quality & flavor! The pita it comes with is literally to die for and if you really love yourself grab a hummus appetizer... you'll thank me later"
"Sometime's I decide to visit places based on the review and articles about them, while other times I go to a place because of word of mouth from a friend.But there's also something to say about those places that you stumble upon by total happenstance that turn into a winner. This was the case for stumbling into Megan's towards the end of our NYC trip, because after an hour of trying to wade through a sea of humanity to see some holiday lights and trees, I found myself REALLY having to go to the bathroom!When you reach that point in a city like NYC you can't just stop and go anywhere, especially when you're around a quadruple jam-packed Times Square during the holiday season. So despite having to go, I tried my best to find a place that wasn't super crowded, super expensive, or a basic fast-food spot. And when we stumbled upon this Irish pub that touted having many taps of beer and then some, it was a sweet relief in more ways than one! The more I chilled inside in the more I realized that it was the perfect off-Irish pub that channeled good memories of some of my favorite Philly one's like Fergie's. Only it had more than double the beers on tap, and had much more of a versatile food menu.Of course this Irish pub had the standards like Guinness, Harp, and some of those regular American brews. But they also had a ton of good locals I never tried and was ready to savor, some draft cocktails and wine, and op tap of that they even brewed their own beers with my favorite being the Irish red ale.For food choices, it was pretty hard to decide since their menu consisted of plenty of traditional Irish foods and pub foods, pizzas, burgers, and then some. But it was pretty hard to overlook their Greek salad that was loaded with grilled shrimp, feta, kalamata olives. All of the above combined for the best salad ever!Toss in incredible bartenders and the ability to order flights when it isn't a jam-packed NYC holiday weekend, and you have a spot I wish I could take back to Philly with me!.Quick | Beer | Chicken Sandwich Quick - We walked in and were immediately seated.  There are two bars that fit about 8 people each downstairs and 20 tables that fit 2 or 4 people on the bottom floor.  We received service immediately and our drinks/food came out extremely quickly. Beer - They have an extensive and diverse beer/alcohol list.  The Beer list has beers throughout Europe on its menu - which raises the quality of the experience.  Additionally, they have a good variety of alcohol types of levels (top - middle - well/house).  You could get food and chill or you could get drinks and chill for a very long time. Chicken sandwich - I really enjoyed the chicken sandwich.  It comes with fries which were pretty standard.  But, the star of the meal was the sandwich.  It comes with a significant portion size and cut in half.  The chicken was fried but the skin was the proper level of crunchy. Pro Tip - They don't have a ton of space.  So, if you want to come with a large party it's not a great spot unless it is relatively empty and you plan on taking it over..5 stars due to service, great New York attitude and selection!My girlfriend and I luckily fell upon Megan's on Saturday night. Bottom floor was packed but Trevor and Carl (2 great Irish lad's) made sure everyone had a full pint. I apologize for not catching his name but their coworker from Venezuela was also working hard making sure the patrons were attended to in a quick manner.  Carl recommend a cider for me to start with before he poured me a proper Guinness. There is a digital jukebox you can sync to and play songs. Unfortunately for Carl, I was feeling nostalgic from a trip to Dublin so I selected some good Irish music. With a quick look of the eye and a couple friendly words Carl changed my music and threw me a $1!Great conversations with Trevor and Carl about what brought them to New York and about 10 pints later, my girlfriend and I were closing out the bar with some new friends we met also on vacation.We made sure to go back for breakfast and 2 of our 3 servers were back working again! These guys are doing all they can to keep their customers happy, bellies full and glasses cold.I had the Irish stew on Saturday and it was a perfect amount of food on a wet NY evening. Filling but not too much.Sunday my girlfriend and I each ordered the Irish Breakfast.... Way too much food for her and just enough to fill me for the flight home.Great spot! Great Guinness. Great Conversations!.This was a nice bar with a good atmosphere and fairly reasonable drink prices for the area. Located close to Times Square and the theatre district in NYC, this is a good place to stop for a quick drink. We didn't order food, but they had pretty standard pub/bar fare. They had a surprising number of signature and home brewed beers, which you don't see often outside of breweries and tap houses. Megan's had a great tap list, with around 50 beers. My favorite that I tried was Meg's wheat beer, which was very light and refreshing. Overall, 16 oz pours were $8 and the flight was $14, which I would normally consider pretty pricey, but was a better price then most of the other bars in the area. The atmosphere was lively and there was several TVs with sports on (basketball and football)..After museum of all morning, we were hangry. The original plan to eat in Grand Central fell apart because COVID apparently took out most of the eating options (sad! Hope it rebounds soon!!), so we found ourselves wandering around helplessly, scrolling Yelp. Megan's caught my eye- mainly because it was less than a block away and had all red stars! Once we walked in the door, however, I knew it was kismet! We were immediately enveloped in warmth- both literal and metaphorical. On a chilly NYC day, Megan's was warm and cozy, an Irish pub from door to decor. We were greeted as friends, a casual hello and easy conversation as we were led to a table further in. The Irish hospitality was perfect- the best way to explain is that feeling of chatting with an old friend-- easy conversation, gentle teasing, shared laughter. Cider was ordered and we settled in to look at the menu. I had a ""Big Meg"" (burger with all the fixings) and fries- my daughter the ""Gaelic Burger"" (cheddar and Irish bacon!)  Both we're excellent- cooked to order, fresh and flavorful. The food came out quickly, and we were checked on, but not bothered as we enjoyed comfortable conversation and good food. The only regret I had was at the end of the meal as we were finishing up our food and signing the check, a waiter walked by with a pizza....mmmmmmm...it looked ahhhmazing. I regret not looking at the menu past the burgers!! (They were great, but ohhh...that pizza looked great too!) All in all, this was a delightfully happy accident- one I encourage you to make..I have been in NYC for a week and I leave today sadly... but I've eaten all over NYC, and by far there were the BEST FLAVORS for the entire trip.  I'm sorry I didn't take a picture of my sandwich (the midtown ) I didn't know it was going to be so delicious until I started eating and could stop!!!.Fantastic spot!  Trevor was fantastic and offered a fun bright spot in our day.  Thank you for the great food and friendly conversation!.Great beer selection, friendly staff. Can only comment on what we had, but everything was top notch. Best lamb burger I have ever had. My wife raved about the chicken pot pie and my daughter devoured her Mac n cheese. Generous portions, reasonable prices..food was good, the waiter visited our table once. never got refills or silverware or condiments. had to take silverware from other vacant table. took about 30 minutes after finishing eating to get the check.Great good! Great drinks! Great atmosphere! Great fun! Looking forward to going back the next time in the city but probably won't be for awhile due to the NYC vax mandate bs! Don't miss this place when you have a chance!"
"Yesterday, in the midst of the Chinese New Year parade chaos, hubby and I were overcome with the desperate need to eat something, and we needed it now.  It was 2:30PM, which was really late to be considered ""lunch"", so we decided to give Fu Mun Lou a try.  Its blue awning captivated us, and we saw some patrons leave that looked like locals, so that kept us open-minded.There were more white people here than my Chinese friends, but they were clearly tourists, so I still wasn't sure how this would pan out.You need to be a little aggressive here to be seated, and we were seated away from the door.  The menu was in English and Chinese, and we had ZERO issues ordering.  I was confused about them offering us hot water first instead of tea, but it felt good anyway.We decided to get pan fried pork dumplings, Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce, beef fried rice and I got the beef with scallions.  How much was all of this? $32.85 - that's just simply AMAZING at this cash only establishment!  What did I like?  EVERYTHING - I'm serious!Dumplings 5/5 - it was worth us asking for them twice since they didn't come from the kitchen right away.  10 per order, they were lightly fried with a great thin skin that felt very homemade.  When I bit it in half, juicy pork essence spilled out!  Make sure you dip the whole thing in their dumpling sauce and shove this in your mouth quick; almost like a soup dumpling.  Chinese Broccoli 4/5 - I was a little confused that they came out from the kitchen diced up and with a little drizzle of oyster sauce, but once we mixed this up, it was perfect.  Nice crispy crunch and they weren't drowning in sauce; really excellent.  These are greens worth eating.Beef fried rice 4/5 - I was really taken aback as to how simple this was presented and how flavorful this actually was.  Generous amounts of sliced beef with a sea of rice and egg, it had me going back to it every time I took a bite of something else.  Great for sharing.Beef with scallions 4.5/5 - For $12.95, I thought I might of made a mistake ordering something on a higher price range, but the amount of beef they give you is justified in the pricing.  We couldn't finish it all!  The scallions and onions that covered the beef, and the marinade were insane.  This doesn't come with rice, so paired with the beef fried rice, I died and went to beefy heaven!  Tender and juicy, this was exactly what I was looking for.You get up and pay at the register up front.Yes, they have two unisex bathrooms, and YES they were actually pretty clean and decent in comparison to some horror stories I'd seen in my beloved Chinatown.I will DEFINITELY be coming back and further exploring the menu..Great food, food taste good and very reasonable price.  I strongly recommend ShaCha Beef.  Thanks.Get it delivered many times and some real authentic which will be a bit challenging to try but most of the food are affordable and delicious. Though i wish they won't mix the oil which they fried seafood to fry the dessert stuff too ‍.So bad.... The dishes have too little weight compare to other fuzhou restaurant.no next time!.Terrible delivery service. The postman would swear customers if you don't give them a lot of tip..better be prepared to speak chinese to order from this place, they'll hang up on you otherwise..childhood place classic fuzhouese restaurant that serves a variety of food including but not limiting to rice, noodles and stir fry dishes and soups..A bunch of friends and I came here not knowing what food they serve. We also couldn't read the menu. We literally asked them to serve us whatever the next table was having. 3/4 dishes were good so we call that a win. Everything was ridiculously cheap. Nobody really spoke English though.Then we found out beer was $1.75. $20 of beers later, we had a great time. We definitely we're not the only ones, great atmosphere..I've been to Fu Mun Lou (or is that Lu?) many times.  In fact, it is one or our go-to places in Sunset Park.  There are some incredibly tasty items on the menu, but this is definitely not a place for a novice round-eye.  The menu, as described in some of the other reviews, is almost impossible, and the wait staff's English varies from good-enough, to nonexistent.   Even pointing to the menu item does not guarantee you're gonna get what you wanted, and if you're  accustomed to food being brought out in a certain order, i.e. appetizers first, forget about that.  It is not a concept of importance at ""Lou's"" as we call the place.    All that said, their dumplings are light and delicious as are the noodles in sesame (or is that peanut) sauce.  The eggplant casserole is one of the best tasting dishes you will find, although on my last visit, after pointing to it on the menu, they decided to bring us a flame-pot of liver and intestines.  Not an easy mistake as I see it, and not an experience I would embrace with enthusiasm or intention for that matter.  Bottom line is if you are not afraid of playing menu roulette, you can get some very good food for incredibly low prices at Fu Mun Lu.  I kinda like the adventure and keep going back....These reviews are so off or friends and family posting. the food was horrible. We all left feeling disappointed. It was a Friday night and they ran out of chicken & Shrimp?!  They served the veggies last, it was so gross in a fermented shrimp paste. Lobster was decent, but u can mess that up. a group of seven, me being the only non-Asian, and they all agreed it was so bad."
"My fave place to go for quick lunch/dinner on 8th ave. This spot serves authentic authentic cantonese homecooked food. Not restaurant food. I'm talking grandma's-house-in-the-mainland type canto food like bitter melon, pork meat pie, fermented peppers, and braised pig's feet. It's the real deal and it's REAL GOOD. They also serve roast meat (chicken, duck, pork). They don't speak fluent English, so it will help if you know Mandarin/Cantonese OR keep your dialogue to a minimum by following the directions below. I highly recommend getting the combo with rice and 3 sides. To order, go up to the glass window (outside) and gesture that you want your food to-go or to eat-in. I usually get it to-go. The sides are displayed in the pans behind the glass. Choose 3 by pointing. My usual order is a meat pie, preserved peppers, and a vegetable. Then, go inside and pay (about $6.50 per combo). They will ask if you want a free soup...say yes because the soup is filled with MSG and is delicious. I can understand why people would be hesitant to come here due to concern for cleanliness, but all the good restaurants in Chinatown are dirty. I'll take my chances..Decided to buy some of my favorite dishes today instead of cooking. It turns out the restaurant has not changed at all. They were closed due to repairs in the gas supply line. Food was tasty as before with only a minor price increase..Just walking around 8th Ave this Sunday and noticed that the restaurant has reopened again after closing around the height of the Covid. Everything seems the same; BBQ meats hanging in front next to trays assorted favorite cooked dishes. The three items over rice combination is the best way to go for lunch or dinner..Much like restaurants with the Chinese bbq hanging in the window except there are many trays of cooked foods displayed as well. Order the various choices of prepared foods over rice or just a whole order of it to go. During the evening rush hours, some of the popular prepared foods are already prepacked and ready for grab and go. The bbq items are also good, tasty, and fresh. Most people go there for quick lunches; dinners are usually takeouts."
"This is a pretty decent Cantonese restaurant with very great prices. You can get three plates over rice for four dollars total. The food is very fresh if we come around lunchtime but it's into special in terms of text. The major advantage of this place is the price point. Also, in the mornings they have dim sum options as shown by the pictures left here. Be careful though; they do not speak English nor do they take credit card as many places in eighth Avenue do not..I am so disgusted with this place! I was looking forward to trying cheap buffet style lunch. Guess what I found in my food, a dead roach! I couldn't believe what I saw and it ruined my appetite. This place does not even deserve a star for cleaniness..I always thought it just cannot be worst, it just can't, and.....here it is. First of all, I'm not sure I'm suppose to be surprise that I can't find review on this restaurant. Well, here it is yelppies. I was in the area tonight, I really like to have one of those duck over rice dish, and because is kinda late, on 8th Ave, this seem like the only one still open, so I went in.Soonest I walked in, the woman behind the counter waved her hand like have a seat on your ownWe sat down, and nobody bring us water, nobody bring us menu, they have total of 4 tables, yes just 4 tables After few minutes later, I saw the waitress went to the front where the hot tea pot located at, pour the old water out from the pot, and input hot water into the pot, and brought it to our table WTF?Don't EVEN BOTHER TO WASH IT??How long those old water been sitting in the pot???That is so..disgusting, unacceptable!!And guess what next?The table sat next to mine, they're 4 guys, they started smoking, I thought we passed the law all the restaurant 'CANNOT' smoke!!I was so pissed, my friend and I got up and left, I'm going to send a letter to the health department, I'm going to report these people!!!"
"I don't know if I can say this is my favorite Chinese food place to order in life and all.  I feel like my regular spot in manhattan that I mostly order chinese had been letting me down lately so I came back to an old favorite in the Bronx close to where I used to live.  The food here is basic Chinese, I mean I love certain dishes to order at almost any different place.  The style of cooking is always a bit different, one place might have the Broccoli with garlic sauce just cooked a bit too much, now the Broccoli taste extra well done (not here just an example), or some people just go with the same thing they order everywhere (Chicken with Broccoli or General Tso's Chicken might be most popular dishes that most people order).  I definitely do order the occasional fried chicken wings with Vegetable Fried rice , but also love something that does have Broccoli so more like Shrimp with Broccoli is something to order.  The House Special Lo Mein was very impressive.  ORDERED it last night and for a large that costs $11, it was well worth it.  Tons of food for two people and even more for leftovers today.  I did order General Tso's in the past here (not my 100% favorite), will order maybe the Ribs tips with plain fried rice next time as well as an order of Tostones along with possibly Fried Scallops.  Wonton soup is a thing I like to order at every Chinese food establishment and I love the soup here.  Wonton by itself or the WONTON with Egg Drop soup is recommended..The chicken and broccoli the rice is kind of dry . The chicken taste weird and the broccoli taste good . The chicken teriyaki if you order it doesn't taste good. The egg rolls ok . The wonton soups taste weird ."
"Get my Sunday dinner here with my husband and sonThey have very good food and the prices are really good People are friendly.I usually order from here. But after last night I won't be doing that again.  This has been a regular of mine for years.   Their food is tasty and quick. HOWEVER be careful of food poisoning. I've been sitting on my toilet since 4 in the morning. Contemplating how my life has taken me this far.  And can barely keep food down. Without it sending me back to the bathroom..Fast and efficient. They are proficient with your everyday Chinese food restaurant menu but they do have a few interesting surprises as well. Don't sleep on the apple sticks or pork buns.  Homemade iced tea fan. No complaints..I ordered through Grub Hub. Asked for my meal to be spicy. Nah, didn't happen at all. I asked for chopsticks, nah, didn't happen either. I had to eat with my fingers. You'd think during a pandemic when restaurants are close to bankruptcy they would do everything possible to appease their customer base. Well, not here. See ya!.I always give this place a good review because I actually like the food. I called for delivery instead of using an app to attempt to order my food and the lady (who usually answers my call) was yelling at me when their own phone wasn't working, then she sighs and yells ""WHAT DO YOU WANT!!!!??"" This was 59 seconds into the call and 30 seconds of it was just some static background noise. I definitely told her a piece of my mind and hung up because no returning customer should be treated this way, and especially because I have been ordering from them for 6 years. She really ruined my day and it may sound petty of me to not go back because of a phone call but I deserve to spend my money where I will be appreciated elsewhere. (By the way, I am a receptionist. It's not like I can't understand some of the frustrations over the phone because I do.).This is my favorite chinese restaurant. I always order on Grub hub, they are always on time to deliver, food tastes good, hot when its delivered, keeps up with all your special requests of your order. I always order the baby shrimp chowfun no vegetables and their fried cheese wontons are my favorite. Their lunch special is worth it..Don't nothing about Chinese food ate once and it was jus broccoli and rice . Thank you kindly haven't ate Chinese since this place.Go to spot for quick Chinese food. . All I eat is broccoli and white rice!! So it's really hard to cook that wrong..I hardly go in this place or order from here because they have always been incompetent and rude. They're in a good, busy location- so people go here for the convenience. Tonight I went in with a simple order of roast-pork egg foo young and chicken wings. When the order was ready the girl yelled at me, chicken wings and egg foo young! "" I didn't check it because she just shouted it and it was such a simple order I never thought it would be missing something. I got home and the chicken wings were missing. I called the place and it was total confusion, nonsense and attitude. Finally they told me to come get the wings and I told them they could deliver them. Waited 40 min for the wings (I live in walking distance and it would take 5 min to run them over to me) called back and the same girl said they were on their way.  Still waiting ...Never again.The food is alright, can't really go wrong with just about any choice and it gets the job done all the time.This place is slacking! I do not get Chinese food often and don't really come here. I went tonight for fries and crab sticks. They use to ask if you want ketchup and hot sauce on your fries before closing the container. She already had the container closed. I went home, their is no fork, napkins or ketchup in bag. The flour on crab sticks could of been cooked longer. For the amount of time I waited it should of been..Greeting - harshService- horrible. Six people came in after me. The left with food before me. Said the egg roll was cooking. Then said wontons were cooking they are frozen then they are boiled then pan fried. Parking- free lot. Tight SpacesPrice- niceBR- one for allFoodExcellent best dumplings and steamed wontons in garlic sauce.Giant fried chicken wings $4 / 4 are goodEgg Roll nice and crispWIGB? NoThe degenerates that go here are a turn off. Not a safe place. The staff is rude because they deal with these low life's all day long. But the food is better than all other Chinese take out places. The ceiling fans are filthy. How they got an A rating i hope was due to a clean kitchen. Its a turn off but the food is good. Hard to say if I will go back. Its been a decade since i was last here due to same reasons. They have another place in babylon go there instead."
"Honestly, I was surprised by how good and actually spicy the green curry (with chicken) here was, considering they offer a range of kinds of items on the menu, and my previous experience with other fusion-type places has made me weary.But it was great! We made short work of it. Service was efficient, impersonal. The place itself had a playful vibe..Interesting mix of Thai/Spanish fast casual spot for some lunch or dinner food. Eclectic vibes with Thai food and Mexican music and decorations.Small Thai place in Chelsea with both a Thai menu and Mexican menu. I didn't have anything from the Mexican menu because I mainly came here for the honey pork slider. The honey pork slider is delicious! Definitely worth trying!! Also got the hobo noodle (at the waiter's suggestion) and it was really good! It had a nice level of spice, and was really good! Good portion, great taste! Would definitely come back to try other things on the menu.The only reason why I took off one star is because they don't sell a few items from the menu they gave us. The waiter told us which items weren't available to order after we already looked at the menu. The restaurant should either cross it off the menu or have the waiter inform your party before you are ready to order..I've recently had this curiosity to try Pad Thai from different Thai restaurants to see which I like best, and I have to say this is definitely one of my favorites. For $10 (lunch) you get all this delicious food which filled me up tremendously while also being delicious and satisfying in every way. They definitely don't skimp out on the veggies which I'm happy about! Love my veggies! I'll remember to ask for extra zucchini  I'm new to the area for work so I've been trying to support small businesses more recently and glad I did. The person up front was very kind and helpful, made it easier to place my order..This place has really cool Thai/Mexican decorations and a menu that's split between the two cuisines. I ended up getting the sweet sausage pineapple fried rice, and it came with a generous portion. The rice was flavorful and the dish was well seasoned. I just never saw any pineapples. It was overall a good experience eating out..This place is DELICIOUSLY AMAZING. I should note we were given a generous donation from meals4heroes (shoutout!) from Thai Sliders, and it was so good! we've been donated these meals several times - I've tried the spicy fish, shrimp pad thai, and garlic stir fry veggies. All were perfectly done. It's my off day today and I'm craving it. Definitely going to hit up Uber Eats for my fix =). Also, the owner is SO sweet - thank you for your kindness!.Came here for dinner randomly with my boyfriend. This place was such a great find. It has a very cute and intimate vibe inside. Our waiter was very kind and I definitely loved the food. I ordered the spicy hobo noodles -- I've never had it before but it was great!! The Thai iced tea and basil fried rice were really good too..Highly suggest Thai & Sliders for a date night or a quick meal. We happened upon this place while walking down the street and it is the cutest aesthetic with respects to Mexican and Thai roots - loved the ambiance here.+Soy Chorizo burrito was huge and good.+Basil Fried Rice with Shrimp was a gigantic portion and plenty of shrimp20% off for a yelp check in was super generous as well. Highly recommend this Thai Sliders!.My friend and I decided to step in while we were walking around the area looking for some food options. We entered at 8 PM on a Thursday night and the place was fairly empty except for one large party. However, the later into the night we were at the restaurant the more filled it became. Service itself was very quick and efficient. As soon as we were seated we received our menu and had our orders taken. I ordered a thai iced tea and my friend and I split a honey pork slider/peanut chicken slider and bowl of kale tonkatu pork ramen. --THAI ICED TEA: Delicious creamy flavor however slightly too sweet for my taste.--HONEY PORK SLIDER: Absolutely delicious! A must get! --PEANUT CHICKEN SLIDER: Not as satisfying as the honey pork slider, the chicken was a little dry but the peanut sauce it was slathered with was nice and had a nice hint of sweetness. The fried wontons that the sliders came with were also a great addition. The size of the sliders were also pretty large so you are getting a good quantity for your money. --KALE TONKATSU PORK RAMEN: The noodles were really good, well cooked and flavorful. I liked the broth as well. The pork was a little dry - I personally like mine with a little more fat which these cuts didn't have. But the veggies helped to add a lot to the noodles as well. The restaurant itself was a little bit dimmer and a bit run down but in a quaint way. All in all, a pretty good joint definitely would like to go back for those honey pork sliders again!.I stumbled upon this place today and was intrigued by the name (I love sliders!). I ordered a Thai iced tea, fried rice with shrimp, and a pork slider. Let me start with the good.....the cashier was very friendly, the Thai iced tea was good and had the right amount of sweetness for me, and the pork slider was amazing! Now for the bad....the fried rice was very bland (it also looks bland). There was no flavor at all which was very disappointing after having the flavorful pork slider. I would definitely go back and try other non-fried rice items on the menu (and get the pork slider again)."
"One the many convention visitors to town, I looked for a place that seemed least likely to have a slew of the Javits-ites and to provide something light and tasty for dinner. Silom didn't disappoint.It's clean and has some sense of decor, but it's not fancy or even Asian chi-chi. Clean and basic.  Plenty of tables for two and a few for four, but I'm sure they'd put tables together to accommodate a bigger party.It's a family-operated place. One of the sons waited on me and of course he knew every dish on the menu and helped me make a couple of great choices.I started with the fish cakes. Plenty for two to split, and a very healthy portion for one, these are bite-sized cakes. Dip them into the provided sauce and soar a bit of iceberg lettuce chips for a bit of crunch. Different, and a great way to start.Next was the panang nuur, a panang curry with thinly sliced beef. There was a sense of cinnamon in the curry, but halfway through all the other flavors were being more prominent. The beef was cooked properly and while not filet mignon (fortunately), it had the right amount of chew and was itself flavour and beefy.$31 for these two dishes, a beer, and a good tip. I'd like to go here again some day..This place is fantastic. I do want to make the disclaimer that I've only been once and had one appetizer and one main dish, but they were both terrific so I'm going to take the liberty of extrapolating and believe that everything on the menu is just as terrific.Came here for dinner and it was very sleek and chic inside...my kind of place already. Started off with the classic fresh spring rolls, which were good but fell more on the standard side. The rice wrappers were slightly tough and I couldn't quite taste the mint, but all the ingredients were well-balanced inside the roll, and the peanut sauce had a spicy kick to it to make it even better than normal peanut sauce! Ordered the Hobo Noodle with shrimp, which was the star of the show. The noodles simply had perfect texture - chewy and substantial, but not so gummy as rice cakes - I could eat those noodles forever. Sauce was incredible as well, and I wish I'd asked what was in it because it was so divine. The string beans were rather undercooked and still hard, but I got a generous amount of shrimp, which I was very pleased about; it's always such a mood dampener when restaurants are stingy about their seafood. And speaking of, portion size was pretty large too. All in all, this dish by far canceled out any negs from the spring roll. I'd give 5 stars just from it alone.Service was the other big component of what made dinner so great - there were probably too many servers for how many people were in the restaurant with me at the time and I sometimes felt like I was being watched, even if I wasn't, but all of them were so unfailingly kind, polite, and discreet the entire time. Can't stress that enough.I'll definitely be back! I'm actually almost even a little afraid to just in case the second time around won't be as great as the first and my memory of those perfect noodles will be tarnished, but...I'm going to say this is a safe one to risk..I stopped into Silom a couple years ago with my mom for a quick lunch. It was absolutely amazing. The place is cozy and the food was fantastic. It's to the point that anytime I mention Thai my mom immediately brings up Silom. I can't wait to stop in soon..Everyone is so so friendly. I accidentally ordered the wrong appetizer and they replaced it with no problems. Their customer service rocks! Food is affordable and amazing. The atmosphere and the ambience is relaxing. I will definitely come back again. Great job!.Went there for dinner a couple of nights ago.  The decor was low key, it was not busy (yet), and quiet - all good.  We ordered Singha beer, steamed pork dumplings, chicken satay, some spicy chicken basil, and pad thai.  They were all tasty, and hit the spot.  The bill was wallet-friendly, and the service was good.  I will be back..Came here last nigh for dinner.  Cute little Thai place in Meatpacking.  Had dumplings- pretty good.  The sauce was tasty as well.  Cute presentation.  ALso had Tom Yum soup w/shrimp.  Had about 3 sliced mushrooms- that needed to be better.  I love this soup with lots of mushrooms, and not the sliced ones.  That was a first.  The broth was OK, the shrimp were good.  Overall, the soup wasn't great.  My friend had a curry with chicken which he liked.  The drinks were cheap.  Paid 7$ for wine (not expensive classy wine, but good enough) and it was a huge glass.  The dear server even let me taste it first.   They have a full bar....Service was great.  Fast and food was freshly cooked.2 bathrooms.  Used both.  The small one in the back.......not so great.  The other one, just fine.Would I come again or recommend?  Yes, but probably won't give the number of places to try in this city!.In a word: Nom.A great spot for omnivores & vegetarians alike.  Their accordion menu can be confusing, but flip it over for the veggie menu and specials of the house (non-veggie).The guy swears by their Special in Honor of the King, while I chow down on their noodles, curries and soups.  Turnip cakes and tofu todd are both excellent appetizers.Although we tend to go there for a late late lunch or early dinner, there's never been a wait for two and dishes come out quick.Minus one star for cold sauces on hot food - specifically the guy's favorite dish mentioned above, whose sauce is sometimes served cold at the dish's expense.  There was also an unfortunate incident involving a new ""Rice Bowl"" menu that seemed to advertise a small soup as part of the meal - turns out the soup wasn't small or included, but the same size and price as the rice bowl.  So we ordered what we thought were two $12 lunch specials but wound up with a ton of food and a $48 check.  The server explained the misunderstanding but didn't alter the check, which kind of cooled us off the place for a minute, and when we returned the menus had been fixed.Solid Thai with no wait keeps us coming back for more.  Thanks, Wave!.Dear Silom staff, I was sooo hungry so I decided to stop here for some Shrimp Pad Thai. As with most Thai places, the pad thai comes with a slightly beaten egg. Yummy, right? No. As I scarfed down the meal, I swallow a wonderful surprise - seemingly disguised as a piece of fried egg white. Thanks for the mint chewing gum in my pad thai. It was refreshing. Expect a health inspector at the door. Love, Peter K.PS A follow up disturbing thought, gum just doesn't randomly *fall* into a hot wok..I really enjoyed the ambience, service and wine, but the noodle dish I had was just bad - lacking flavor, and bad meat quality.  Maybe my trips to Sripraphai and pok pok ny have spoiled me a bit. :(.Haiku #4Chelsea and Thai foodLike Starbucks in Manhattan- One on every blockI tried 4 placesMy  top pick  was Room ServiceBut they had closed downSilom sits on topOf Thai places in ChelseaLet me explain why:Silom is cozyIt's gently lit for dinnerSpace for twelve tablesTry the ""Penang Nuur""Beef, peppers, and white onionsSpicy/sweet curry.No Calimari!Rubber texture gently friedWith bland dipping sauce.Why rate it 4 stars?Efficient service and staff Always on their toesNot to many frillsA typical Thai menuTypical pricesHere is a quick tip:Thai people don't use chopsticks!Their main tool are forksA Stereotype If a place offers chopsticksRefuse politely"
"I almost don't want to leave a review to let the secret out about my new go-to for Guyanese/Chinese. The lamb dishes are a game-changer. The lamb is thinly sliced and tender. I got the spicy garlic lamb which I expected to be spicier but it was still flavorful, I'm definitely trying the jerk next time. We also ordered boneless cha chi kai chicken, jerk chicken rasta pasta, chicken lo mein, and veg fried rice. Everything was tasty and I'm happily eating leftovers as I write this..Definitely a hole in the wall spot I must've walked past a bunch of times but I'm glad I actually stopped in. It looks like a club/lounge which is why I never anticipated their food being as good as it is The portion they give of their shrimp Rasta pasta is huge! I appreciated that they packed a menu, a small bag with napkins, utensils and pepper sauce in my take out order. I liked my pasta very much. the shrimp was a little over cooked so a few of the shrimp did taste rubbery but despite that I do see myself returning..I have to say by far this is the best takeout food I have had in a very long time. The flavors were on point. The service was great. The location is amazing and beautiful. I can't wait for them to be fully open for dinning in. And man the owner is an amazing person, she took her time to answer all my questions, and made my visit a great experience. I will definitely be back for more. Thank you for a great dinner experience. I loved every little bit of it!!!"
"Good fried chicken and fries. Friendly staff. Quick service. The food is always hot and made to order..This is the 3rd time I threw up from this place. Don't go here. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt but nah. If I can give them 0 stars I would.In the City That Never Sleeps, nothing beats an eatery that truly understands our city life and stays open late.It's a nice, small space with two sets of tables to dine in that offers friendly and fast service. Great prices. Good food. Affordable prices for the sandwiches and meals. I ordered the chicken sandwich, which was delicious..I always eat here or at the other location in cypress ave and they are great!! Fresh fast and convenient as always!! Fast and free deliveries as well.it's a really good ""fast food"" place. everything is really good and the portions are big. the only downside is it seems their philly cheesesteak got smaller. they use to be so big and cheesey but the most recent time i got it, it was very tiny. aside from that everything else is good.Please stay great!The burgers are delicious, they even toast the bread! The food never tastes old and they have a great pick up/ delivery system.Great chicken! The biscuits are delicious and the burgers are well made and filling. And the strawberry milkshake had strawberry pieces. Everything was wonderful..I'm giving this place a 4 because I think it's a little pricey. The chicken and fries specials aren't pricey, but the sides are (5 dollars for cheesesticks?). Nevertheless, the service is good and the food is as good in the fast food way. They also keep great hours. One thing to keep in mind is that they charge 2.75 percent for credit card transactions..This place has really stepped up their game. I came hear a year ago with my boyfriend and it seemed to take a while for the food to come out but it always tastes incredible. This week I was feeling awful and didn't want to cook so I called to pick up an order. The guy answering the phone spoke clear and perfect English and was so nice!! The food was great as always, and he made sure I had ketchup and napkins which are critical in my opinion. He even reminded me not to forget to choose a canned soda that's included in the meal because I wanted fries. Incredibly impressive for Bushwick, that guy should be a manager. Wish I knew his name.The only thing they could do to make this place better is to update their signage. The photos of food are faded and look kind of gross. The food, as I said, is incredible and deserves to be represented as such. I would consider taking photos of and condensing the menu a bit so that it's easier to read.Keep it rocking Texas!.Nice fresh food with great prices! It's nice & quick and also super clean place. Burgers are really delicious as well as side orders many to choose from !"
"Just like there are in Manhattan, there are better places to grab a slice or two in the Bronx. Though when you're in an area you're not overly familiar with, you sometimes like to rely on the comforts of the known. I might have visited the Pelham Bay section of the Bronx half a dozen times a year tops for work, & would usually be in prime position to grab a late afternoon lunch here.The pizza isn't great, but it's far from bad. Do you run the risk of burning the roof of your mouth on it sometimes? Yes. Is the can of pop that comes with their 2 slices for $3 a convenient way to help soothe that burn? Also yes..Two Brothers Pizza is a terrific spot. The value is exceptional. They have a phenomenal menu too. The team is really a highlight of this place because they are always fast, courteous, and provide service with a smile! I can recommend that place enough, it's so relaxing and amazing vibes..after getting off the 6 train buhre station  i went to my second fav italian bakery to pick up a few pies and before heading back to the lovely 6 train (cant wait for april to end and my no car ban is done) i notice two brothers pizza shop and decided to grab 2 slices and diet coke for lunch and with inside seating available i took all my sweet time . good pizza and just like most pizza joints you can also grab specialty pizza, pasta dishes , heroes, garlic knots, chicken rolls, calzones , etc. glad these old school pizza shops are still around and with two brothers pizza serving tasty slices they should have no problem sticking around ..Randomly went here for a slice and some Burek. The food is delicious! The crust is crispy and everything was so tasty. Moreover, the staff was really pleasant and the prices are reasonable. This is officially my go-to pizza spot!.Great pizza place, $2.50 per pieces! Great price and dinner!You can choose your own recipes, add your own favorite create your custom make pizza..Mold on their mushroom. Picked up 2 slices one plain and one mushroom, brought it home for my 5year old. He wouldn't come close to it at all. Took a whiff and OMg! Never will go back again. Guy doesn't even say sorry-.Delivery was fast. Very surprised they came all the way up to my door.  Food was ok. I ordered a lasagna and grilled ch chicken salad.  Lasagna was ok big order lasted me till the next day . And salad could of Been better.. barely any lettuce but lots of chicken. Next time I'll check out there pizza..The older bald head guy that works here has the worst disgusting rudest attitude ever. I called my order in and he told me ""25 minutes"" ..... so I drove there and got there in 20 minutes. When I told him what order I was picking up he starts screaming and rabbling on saying ""I told you 25 minutes not 20minutes it's not ready and now you will have to wait another 15 minutes because I'm busy"" I'm not sure if he's a racist or just hates women but he definitely didn't speak to any other men or people of his culture the way he spoke to me..Excellent local pizza shop and so much more!!  We really don't know how we didn't find this place sooner.  The food is always fresh and delicious!  The chicken parm is my favorite.  And very reasonable priced and large portions.  We definitely found our new go to pizza shop!.If you're looking for the best Burek with meat, you must try it here. They have the best burek in the Bronx."
"This is my favorite pizza place.  The slices are HUGE and amazing.  I'm a two-slice girl at any other pizzeria, but I can only handle one Pinocchio's slice.Be warned that it's a no-frills shop. It's better that way. Order a slice, grab a drink, sit down and eat..Super gigantic slices! Been coming here for years! For the first time I got it delivered. It showed up in 20 minuits nice and hot! Great service! Really fast!.if I could give this place -5 starts I would.I used grubhub to order from them.My first time was amazing. Perfect piazzas. I finally found a pizza place that made good pizza that wast domino or papa johns to deliver to me.2nd time..something was off about the burger it was kind of raw but not bad just found that odd the pizza wasn't good  like the first timethe 3rd time ..idk what the hell is going on with this place.... my burger meat was charred I could not eat it. my pizza disgusting all dough barely any of my 3 toppings with 1/3 toppings missing..wtf did I even pay for nearly $20... I call for a refund and they tell me no through grub hub.thank goodness for my card company I can still get a full refund. But the nerve of this place.  If I couldn't eat the food why should you keep my money. what a gross mentalityMind you the deliver guy is a totally rude... yet expects higher tip you lucky I tip you at all o r I cant finish my order on grub hub.Will never order from them again..Don't order anything from this ""restaurant"".I am pretty irritated as I write this, having just got off the phone with whom I assume is the owner. I wanted to give this place a try since it first appeared on GrubHub, but I wasn't able to since they weren't delivering to my area. After having an order get canceled today, I decided to see if they finally expanded their area and to my surprise they had. I ordered myself a spinach calzone and a grilled chicken panini, which according to GH is made with tomato, basil, olive oil, grilled chicken and mozzarella. Sounds pretty good, right? Too bad in reality it's actually caesar dressing and chicken with wilted lettuce put in hero bread that's been through a panini press. Oops. I opened my sandwich expecting to see what's advertised and was VERY disappointed, seeing as how if I wanted grilled chicken caesar I'd have ordered it, you know? I call the restaurant and begin to explain my problem. He gives me a million stereotypical bad customer service quotes such as :""What do you want me to do about it?"" ""You should call Grub Hub about that""""There's nothing I can do about it now""""The guy in the kitchen did that""I wish I was joking. I have so many issues with the conversation I just had with him.You have employees who don't know your menu, so that tells me mistakes happen frequently and since food allergies are common, who knows who has gotten sick from ""mistakes"" by the ""guy in the kitchen"". If I was vegan and ordered a salad that had meat in it, I'd be furious. This place isn't worth your time or money..Its 1030pm on a weeknight and i was looking for a quick slice. Decided to stop in since they were still open. They charge $3.00 a slice but its worth it because of the size,The pizza doesnt seem very fresh but i cant complain its late,slow,and a weeknight. Im definitely coming back here when its busy.Horrible pizza.Tried it on a whim to think maybe a new pizza place near-by...worse mistake ever.The pizza was large, yes, but the flavor was HORRIBLE! It had no flavor, even after adding a lot of salt and pepper. And the garlic knots were horrible and we only received THREE!  ONLY THREE!I recommend Crosby Pizza (best pizza in the neighborhood) , not too far from this horrible place. Do not go to this place, you will regret it..I loveeee this place ever since the new owners took over. They are great. The food is delicious and you should try the ""burek"". It looks so much cleaner and the food tastes better. Pizza is great but the other food is also amazing. You should try this place out!!  Always going there now..OMG!!!  ... got there around noon.  Gotta think slices are gonna be fresh.  They looked like yesterdays slices taken out of refrigerator.  Against better judgement I decide to order a Sicilian slice.  Comes out barely warm and is the worst pizzza I've ever tasted.  Frozen supermarket brand X pizzas are better than this.  I took a bite, spit it out and chucked the slice in the garbage.  Run, don't walk from this place.  Scrape the cheese off last weeks pizza delivery box or even eat it with the cardboard box and it will be better than this..This place isn't called Pinocchio's Pizza, but Two brother's pizza. Great place, great food, great service..I've been to Pinocchio's twice and I should have learned from the first visit and not gone the second time.  The pizza at Pinocchio's is proof that size does NOT matter...at least when it comes to pizza. The slices are very generous in size.  But then again, the slices are $3.00. That's not cheap.  After all pizza is just bread, sauce and cheese. Very little overhead. Again, the slice are large, but they are very thin, as is the taste. There is very little flavor.  I rather pay $3 for a regular size slice that at least doesn't taste like the take-out carton it's put in."
"Michelin Five Star Establishment and I can see why!!For starters, the ambiance is so classy. It's located on the 4th floor with floor to ceiling windows with dim lighting and beautiful decor. If you're looking to impress your guest(s), this is the place.Food: delicious!! They cater to both meat, seafood and vegan options. I ordered the Filet Mignon ($70) with truffle mash potatoes ($18) The portion size looked small but it was so fulfilling. Don't quote me on the pricing but it's somewhere around that price.Drinks: I forget the name of my drink but it had whiskey and lemon in it. It looks dark pink and tasted strong but I guzzled two of them down. I'm not sure if it was as strong as it tasted, or my tolerance increased.Overall: I would totally recommend this place. You don't need a covid test or proof of vaccination to enter (at least we didn't upon entry). There's also a lounge right next door if you want to dance afterwards..A Valentine's dinner date done right at the Porter House! The food, service, decor and ambiance were all fantastic!My boyfriend and I had made a reservation for an early Valentine's weekend dinner at the steakhouse located on the 4th floor of the Columbus Circle Mall. Upon arrival, the gentlemen in suits checked us for our vaccinations and IDs, and then we checked in at the front desk for our reservation. We were seated immediately and the entire check-in process was well under a min! When we sat down, we were greeted by our waitress who introduced us to the house menu and a elegant white-clothed table with roses for Valentine's Day. The menu includes a variety of options from starters, salads, steak, pasta to a bunch of vegetable sides and potatoes. Moreover, the drinks menu was very elaborate was over 15 pages of selections. We ordered the filet mignon and chili ribeye with brussel sprouts and mashed sweet potatoes. For drinks, we ordered a prohibition strawberry spritzer and Cabernet red wine. Before our dinner arrived, we were given cranberry bread which was delish topped with butter! After about 25 mins, our food which was plated so simple yet classy, arrived. Both steaks and sides were very well-seasoned and flavorful. The steaks were very tender and juicy. To top off dinner, we got the Valentine's Day dessert special - raspberry white chocolate mousse and it was definitely a very memorable dessert. Our dinner totaled $300. The overall service and ambiance of the restaurant was top quality and wonderful too!Overall, I highly recommend checking out the porterhouse for any special event celebration :).Honestly dismal experience. It was freezing cold inside, asked for them to make the temperature warmer and I watched as the temperature slowly ticked down inside from 69.5 to 68.5 with cold air beating down on us and our food (thermostat located next to us lol). The table next to me left early and I could hear them complaining about how cold it was to each other too. It's really not fun when it's a steakhouse because all the food gets cold.- FOOD WISE-*The complimentary bread was cold and probably the worst out of every steakhouse in NYC worth going to. The cinnamon raisin nut bread was questionable (my partner joked that it tasted like a bad stale bagel) and the sourdough just missed the mark. *The server recommended bone marrow as the appetizer which was absolutely excellent, and I highly recommend it. It came out and warmed us up, and the bread that was provided was toasted and warm. I would avoid eating the complimentary bread if you go for this app. *Porterhouse for 2 was OK. It wasn't the best but had excellent char for a decent enough mouthfeel with every bite. Cooked medium rare, temperature was slightly off a couple degrees leaning to more of a rarer grill than a perfect med-rare. *Sides were black truffle mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach. The creamed spinach was probably the worst I have ever eaten in my entire life in NYC and I have made it a point to visit every steakhouse thus far. It was a soupy watery mess. The black truffle mashed potatoes were excellent, but St**p Hou** does it even better. If you know your steakhouses then you know what institution I'm talking about LOL. *Sauces - were excellent but the cool temperature made them congeal into a thick mess. *Dessert - Coffee for two and the chocolate fudge bar with vanilla gelato. The dessert was good to share for two people and enjoyable. *Service- It started off really well, and our server was really nice. But he never asked if we wanted refills on our coffee (and we did) before throwing us the bill. I think they are really understaffed and it shows. For a $300 meal,  we felt really rushed out at the end (and by then we had only been eating for 1 hr 20 min). It was a subpar experience for a restaurant located in such a good location among heavy-hitters in the vast culinary scene. This place was recommended on the Michelin Guide and TimeOut among many other publications but if you're looking for steak, go elsewhere because this place is not it. The booth seating in the bar looked much more intimate and was warmer, so for dates I recommend coming here for just the bone marrow appetizer & drinks..I was very impressed by our meal here. We came with friends on a Saturday night. The place was packed but our waiters were fantastic. They made sure we always had what we needed and never made us feel rushed. This always adds to the experience for us. We ordered a ton of apps and sides to split for the table. The bone marrow appetizer was super rich and one of the best bites of the entire night. The Hamachi crudo also stands out, as it was really light and refreshing. All of the sides (french fries, onion rings, spinach, and mushrooms) were tasty and nice portions for splitting amongst the 4 of us. Our porterhouse for 2 was super tender and perfectly cooked (rare). Desserts were good, but everything else stood out more. Would definitely come back..I'm not sure that you'll get your money's worth, but it's a nice place for a special meal...view, service, and my cowboy ribeye was perfectly charred with a medium rare core. The fat was was crisped, and when you drew your knife through the steak the liquid gold seeped out, enveloping the meat in a luscious embrace...making your tastebuds feel loved. The sides and apps were all very good, but the steak, rightfully so, was the star of the show...I loved the cowboy ribeye, possibly the best steak I've ever eaten..Went here the Saturday before Valentine's Day. Amazing. Security checked COVID vaccine cards, and ID. The hostess was friendly, and escorted us to our seats immediately. We sat in a lovely booth, which had a nice view. The servers were so super attentive, multiple servers asked if we were okay or if we needed anything. The maitre d also came around multiple times to ask if we were ok. The slab bacon was amazing, first of all. Probably one of the best I've ever had! But the wagyu rib eye!!!!! OH MY GOODNESS. Juicy, full of flavor, melt in your mouth deliciousness. The mushrooms were to die for and the creamed spinach (mr Pete's way) was so goooooood! Also for dessert, i got the coconut cake with a mango sauce on the side... wow. Just wow. Loved everything..Came here for my friends birthday dinner. We went a little late so I do recommend setting early reservations. The staff is very accommodating and knowledgeable of the menu. I was very interested in the meed here and unfortunately on their updated menu they had removed the selection. None the less our server still brought out the meed that they had for me to taste and try. I bought 2 bottles of meet that night. It was amazing. If you go to try the meed their, the cheapest selection is the best tasting. Everything else is very ""viking"" like,  you have been warned. The food was very good and everything thing was cooked well. The risotto was so good. As well as the salmon and steak. The portions are small here and you are paying for an expierence so keep that in mind.The decor is very nice and polished. The view of the circle is so beautiful and makes the dining experience even better..Amazing meal. Came with a party of 9. Everything was perfect about the night. Great setting, energy, ambience. Fantastic service and delicious food. We had the seafood towers which were delicious and fun for a group, in addition to the bone marrow, porterhouse steak, the truffled potatoes and slab bacon, all insanely good. Will definitely be back soon..The Porter House Bar and Grill is a beautiful space, located in at Columbus Circle. The restaurant is pretty and elegant. The tables are well spaced  The maitre d' and staff were all very nice and attentive.  Our habitually late friends forced us to make do with main courses and drinks only.  My strip steak was excellent and cooked perfectly.  My wife was less excited about her filet mignon.  The steaks were accompanied by some excellently dressed watercress.  The elephant in the dining room here is the prices.  Dinner for four, consisting of a cocktail or glass of wine, 4 orders of steak and 4 side dishes was $550, including tax and tip.  It seemed really expensive to me.  This was my first trip to a steakhouse since the pandemic started, so I wondered if it was due to prices going up as a result of that and the Russia-Kiev war.  Out of curiosity, I checked the prices at Keen's steakhouse, one of the archetypes of a great NY steakhouse. They were 20 to 25% less.  So the nosebleed inducing prices of entrees (if you have to ask how much the Wagyu steaks cost, you cant afford them) are peculiar to this restaurant.  There are a number of ways to unpack this.  The Porter House's neighbors are Masa and Per Se, so a three course dinner for over $150 per person is a relative bargain.  You can also look at it as paying for the beautiful space and service.  We were seeing the Philharmonic at Jazz at Lincoln Center, so you couldn't ask for a more convenient location.  Anyway, for a real steak dinner, the Porter House is a questionable value proposition.  This may make me sound like a hater, but I'm not.  I would happily return and consider ordering a more moderately priced meal, like a burger, pork chop or steak frites.  Since it was my first meal at a nice steakhouse in a long time, I decided to go all in!.We thoroughly enjoyed our recent dinner here. It's a lovely, upscale steakhouse with first-class food, service and ambience. And they have a really good wine list, too! here are great views out the windows though to be honest the view from our table was a bit limited. Nonetheless, the food was dazzlingly good -- the ribeye and the filet were splendid pieces of meat, cooked to our perfection (a little less than medium), and for one diner at our table, they did a rare just right. The sides were delicious, and the Cabernet we ordered was a superior wine and pretty reasonably priced. Their wine list has lots of choices, not all of them super expensive. Our servers were outstanding: friendly, very knowledgeable, efficient and just downright professional in all aspects of the evening. We let we were treated as valued guests, and when you're paying this kind of cash for a meal, that's a darned good thing."
"What an amazing new spot for updated takes on Turkish classics, and generally one of the best vibes for brunch in Brooklyn as of March 2022. I made a reservation on Instagram with my amateur Turkish, and the owner was kind enough to entertain my fragile communication skills, even if English might have made the whole process easier. Service was very friendly, and my dining partner and I enjoyed a few Turkish coffees and cups of çay on a leisurely Sunday morning.We shared the labne poached eggs and menemen, with a side of plain pide and a simit. The labne poached eggs were highly recommended, and these were indeed the star of the show. I couldn't tell where the rich labne ended and the egg yolk started, but it all blended into a heavenly topping for the simit. The menemen was also well spiced and much enjoyed.Will be back to try the dinner rakı service soon!.Small and quaint this neighborhood restaurant is comfortable and beautiful. The hospitality of this husband & wife duo is phenomenal! Cocktails are made by the husband while the wife holds down the front of house with help from one other person.My friend invited me here and I see why. Dishes are simple but only in the number of ingredients. Food was made to order and full of flavor and textures. Marinated olives were a great small bite to start. The carrots and labneh were a real stand-out. The chicken schnitzel was hot and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The fresh cabbage slaw and tobiko made it that much better. So much depth in their dishes and something for everyone even though the menu is concise. Would highly recommend dining here!.Stopped in for a solo dinner here, and I was there before 6, however they were already starting to get busy / had reservations booking out the whole place. I had the filo cigars stuffed with potatoes, and the ras el hanout heavy carrot dish which came with bread. You could tell every ingredient was the highest quality, and seasoned so well. The owners are super friendly and could see they care so much about their patrons - a number of folks seemed to be regulars. I only wish they had more vegetarian friendly entrees - the ones I ordered were starters..Owned by a lovely husband and wife who run the place. Food was delicious and beer was great! Such friendly home owned vibes. Will definitely be going back..Really really cute spot with (married) Turkish female and German male owners. They were both super friendly and served us personally. His homemade bloody mary was quite good. I would certainly be a regular if I lived in the neighborhood. Always pleased to find simit (a thin turkish bagel). The poached eggs with the whipped garlic were incredible. The spicy sucuk sandwich was also quite good - nice take to have it on a potato roll. The side of home fries were fried pretty uniquely, too. Could have used a more meaningful sauce, maybe an aioli. Overall, really cute pleasant spot!.I have been wanting to try this place for a long time as I've lived a block away for the last 2 years (covid has made it hard). I walked up tonight when it was pretty full (only one couple waiting for a table though..) and waited outside for someone free I could ask about the wait time. A woman comes walking up to me and before I could even finish ""how long would it be for a table"" she waved her hand in my face and said ""ZERO. Not a chance. IMPOSSIBLE."" Totally threw me off. I really wanted to go here but the staff was so rude I do not recommend..Super cute, small menu but the food is incredible. Also the drink/wine/beer list is extensive. Kitchen does close early though. And they take reservations via Instagram! Important cause it's relatively small..The food and the people at Bunny are so wonderful! We have a great experience every time we go there. The owners are incredibly friendly and welcoming. You can tell they truly care about the community that their restaurant is in--a vibe you don't get at all newer NYC establishments. You never feel rushed when you're dining at Bunny. The dishes are really original riffs on classic turkish and german cuisine, and are always so delicious. They are currently doing outdoor seating and ""bunny bags"", which are to-go picnic style meals with wine or beer included. They also have a fridge of prepared foods to go. I recommend both dinner and brunch at Bunny, but especially brunch!.Photo of the bar area adjacent to the music station (a collection of records, a turn table (?)) -- tastefully decorated. The details of the decor are exquisite in addition to the great food. Very enjoyable -- check it out! I like the German Pizza, Fava (incredible presentation) and the chicken Schnitzel. The Raki drink is a must as well..Lovely little place in the neighborhood. The owner and the chef/owner are very friendly and made us feel at home. The dishes are all simple but made well & delicious. One suggestion would be to add allergens to their menu as my girlfriend is gluten intolerant and almost had a dish she couldn't eat. Big thanks to the chef who made a last second accommodation to make sure she could have the fish!"
"This is one of the worst McDonald's I ever been!!!From service to food to cleanliness is not worst to come even though this place is the closet McDonald's from me. The manager is very rude in answering questions. The floor and table is always dirty even you see staff going around but the place is still a mess. How can McDonald's food be bad? But it really did!!! The bread, cheese and meat is all scrambled. Fries is over cooked and the coke taste nasty! If you have a car, try somewhere else and avoid coming here!.A simple self order #249 and I get the wrong item! I went back to get it corrected but wonder why no attempt to see who or how this went wrong? Do they care?.STAY AWAY!!!  Order is never correct. Not once have they not forgotten something.  The real reason I am writing a review is that this evening our order gave everyone FOOD POISONING.  My family realized too late that the food had a funny smell and threw it all out but it was too late because the damage was already done.  NEVER EVER AGAIN WILL WE GO HERE. If there was another fast food location in this area I am sure they would lose a majority of the people who go here. Do yourself a favor. Go anywhere else..Every item from this mcdonalds will be made by the highest employee of the day. If ingredients stack into a sandwich you will be lucky..Best  McDonald's in the entire NYC managed very well , professional and friendly. I'm go to many McDonald's over last 3 decades. This location is the Gold standard of McDonalds.I don't get this place you close at 1am but when 12am hits no one wants to do their job. So what's the point of being open till 1am and we can't make an order at that last hour. How about instead of ignoring the customers at the drive thru why not say kitchen closed or change your hours of operations to close at 11pm..The Food is Ok, but the big problem is that this McDonalds you don't get the right order from the Drive Thru, Always their is no space to eat because of groups of Asians drink their coffee and stay their for 2 and a half hours. The place was renovated but lately some sealing tiles turned brown. Found mold on one of the tiles above the registers. But the also big problem is their is only one person at the cash register and everyone is ordering on the kiosk and the line is always long. Also most employees don't know what their doing one time the McDonald's smelled like something is burning (psst... my food was one of the victims) and the new employees at the cash register don't know what their doing (even entering the Kiosk stub to pay). Good Luck.So somehow I have ordered iced coffee and twice I got it without ice. Iced coffee with no ice? The workers at the window are usually very nice. If you wait for curbside pick up good luck. You'll be there at least 10 minutes and I've actually had to walk in to let them know I never got my food. Check your bags before you leave to make sure everything is correct..No words. All the romance and allure of the McDonalds of my youth is gone. No employee morale, no evidence of pride or a credo of service.  Likelihood of receiving a package with exactly what you ordered: 75%   We only go when everything else is closed. Sorry.I usually don't write reviews and neither do I want to write negative ones, but their service compelled me to. I usually go through drive-thru and perhaps this time I decided to do curb side. I tried it three times and all those three times I've waited more than 10mins and also did not get my full order. I was always missing something. Then, I would go back in and stand there for a while until I'd raise my voice to say; ""I need help"" and they look at me like I got a fifth head. Anyways, don't expect much from a fast food joint but man, anybody who's paying something should at least get their order correctly. I'm giving out money out here for a wack service. My advise...? Just go through drive-thru and always check your bag. :).Terrible quality of mcd, terrible service. Got there at 12am, they close at 1am. I pull into the drive through and see a car finish being served. I'm waiting at least 10 minutes at the intercom. I call the location but no one answers and I clearly see workers inside. I drive up and they just look away and act like they're not there. Finally someone shakes their finger at me. They could have told me they were closed as soon as I pulled into the store. I do not recommend you go here"
"First time ordering delivery from here. The order was handled exceptionally with care! I was scared my reindeer cake pops might've gotten smushed on the way here, but they came perfectly!!!The chestnut praline latte was still super hot when I received it, with minimal spillage. Would order from here again!.I went to this location early in the morning. Even before talking about customer service and stuff, this bread was not even fresh. The drinks were alright that's why I'm giving 2 starts. I had really bad diarrhea after this.. to the point that I had to visit the pharmacy to get some medications for myself... Would you guys ever eat this bread....I Ordered at 7:45 PM and now they are making my drink at 8:10 PM. This Starbucks was a five star rating store now I am mad waiting for 25 minutes. And it's not even busy. There's only one person making drinks. They are too busy talking to one another. If they have too many orders i usually wait at least 10 minutes but now I'm waiting for 25 over minutes..It was my birthday today so, I ordered my free Starbucks drink (has to be on the day of your birthday FYI) The store adhered to social distancing, required mask on entry, allowed one customer in at a time, and even had taped grounds to guide you where to go. When I held up my starbucks app and told them I wanted to redeem a free drink (you have to tell them ahead of time that it's a free birthday drink otherwise when they scan they will charge you for the drink), they gave me smiles and cheered happy birthday. It felt very special and personable as I was the only one in the store. They also set up speakers so customers who ordered and waited outside or mobile-ordered could be contacted when to come in and grab their orders. Really like the experience as they made me feel welcomed.  to those three ladies who held down the store in these hard times and were still able to deliver excellent customer service. Also peep the personalized happy birthday writing on the cup..Great Starbucks location in my neighborhood. I usually order on my mobile device and pick it up at the store which is convenient and faster because this location is always busy with students from Cardozo high school loitering in here. Never had an issue with my orders and staff seems friendly. I think it would be nice if they had another location on Bell Blvd and 73rd Ave to ease the crowd ness during school hours..Definitely one of the better locations, well organised and a productive system the staffs have got with one another.Super clean, they were very equipped with safety controls for COVID. They are so efficient there was never a backlog of orders, so people were always able to observe social distancing.Order notes are followed 99% of the time. Only on a few occasions I've had very bitter coffee served to me with noticeable amount of dregs pooled at the bottom, minus a star. But that's a few isolated occasions, nonetheless a huge thanks to the staffs working away tirelessly to provide the much needed caffeine buzz to keep this economy ticking along, especially in these times.Stay safe everyone.Why is this place so unreliable? Sometimes they're open, sometimes they just close, sometimes they're open until 2pm. Mobile order says they're sold out of certain items, so I proceed to order something else, when I go to pick up my order I see that the so called sold out items are actually in stock..Food and drink were good as usual. Gabby's customer service/etiquette wasn't so good. However, she was not rude, she just seemed to have an attitude and come off as not nice or maybe she was frustrated about something. Richard was polite and nice. I am a firm believer that if customer service isn't your thing you should not take a job that requires you to DELIVER! When it comes to customer service..Come back here every time I am in the area.  Was here 8 months ago and nothing has changed since my previous reviews.  Staff are very friendly!  Drinks are accurately made.  No long wait.  Still very clean location.  Always busy!  Conveniently located near the bus stops!  Super great location!.Another year just flew by & decided to update my review on this Starbucks!  Still clean and want to give extra credit to the staff!  Staff is super friendly even when the place is packed!  Drinks come out pretty quick and always accurate.  Highly recommend this location!.Friendly staff!  Clean & roomy!  So appreciative Starbucks opening this location since there are none close by.  Great location!.This Starbucks exceeds all customer service experiences that I've encountered that I even took the time to write to the home office to give this location kudos. The staff is super nice EVERY TIME I enter the place. It has been my go-to location since Covid hit and their safety precautions are up to code and everyone is wearing masks. I know that it's difficult to please people in this neighborhood but there is always a kind person behind the counter and you can tell through their masks, a smile on their face! Thank you and keep it up."
"Country Heart Cooking was lovely! I recently had breakfast there while visiting Breezy Point for the first time with friends. The entire community is friendly and warm and this restaurant was the embodiment of that as well. The waitress was amazing and joked with us, the food was great, and several other older patrons even said a friendly hello to us during the course of our meal. I will definitely be back and highly recommend!.had a nice lunch/brunch on Sunday.  The group I was with sat at one of the booths after local church service.  The place was not crowded.  We were promptly given menus and had drink orders in.Just a bit of wait on the food, not to bad though.  Everyone enjoyed the food and given ample quantities.  I ordered the turkey club on rye.  Very satisfied. Service was good, can't beat the price either.  The only complaint would be size of coffee mugs.  They couldn't be bigger than 6ozs.  Makes the waitress add extra visits for refill.  Bigger cups or just leave a pot on the table.Ended up here because my nephew had a soccer game on a nearby field. Very cute and very country looking. In a small shopping center. The coffee was horrendous and the food but basic that didn't need to take forever to get. I got the nyc staple bacon, egg and cheese on a kaiser roll and extra bacon. It was good but not waiting half hour for when you can goto a bodega and get one super fast. Would I go back? Doubt it unless I was desperate.Small cramped dark place. Staff is more concerned with their own conversation and phones rather than getting the customer what they want. Slow kitchen. Food is mediocre at best. I've been here a handful of times and that's only because it's one of only 2 places in the area to grab food. I won't be back..Don't understand the place at all. Located in a beach community, Country Heart Cooking just doesn't fit. What kind of name like that fits in a beach community? Then you walk in and it's pink everywhere, again disregarding its environmental surroundings of a beach. Everything is pink in there, how is pink a beachy color or an appealing color? The service is good depending on who, once had a post it reminding me to tip, which made me give less. Food sure is delicious tho! Only reason it gets the 2 stars, was better when they had pizza..Great Place. The chef Jeremiah knows his frying techniques and all other organizers of this establishment get this place working correctly. A descent place to relax and eat as well as snack and enjoy an eating experience..Went for breakfast on Sunday morning. Food was great no problem, service was awful. Sat at counter place WAS NOT FULL three waitresses working waited forever to take order and then even longer to get my drink. The part that really rubbed me the wrong way was the owners were sitting outside when I got there and when I finally left. Go inside and assist do something. If they don't care about their establishment why should customers go?.Stopped in for breakfast yesterday morning, even with the current state of Breezy Point after sandy they are still serving out solid meals to all the contractors, recovery workers, and of course the locals. Hat's off Country Heart Cooking !"
"I am obsessed with Hanco's. Not only is it a few blocks away from my apartment, but the food and beverages are great. I order from this place pretty much once a week, which means you know it's consistently good.My typical order rotates between the rice vermicelli salad and the pho. I tried vegetarian pork with my vermicelli salad and now I only have it with it. Really cool to see a viet food place that offers so many options for protein as well as options to customize (extra sauce, extra noodles, etc). For the pho, I usually get the beef one with all the tendons. It's a perfect meal for the day after a long night out with drinks. For drinks, they also have a lot of options for bubble tea/boba which is great if you like having milk tea one day and a refreshing iced green another day. My normal drink order is the iced green tea with lychee jelly and no sugar. I usually only deliver, and it always comes on time or earlier, and if there are any issues they are very proactive with reaching out to follow up. I don't get why their ratings are so low. Don't believe the negativity on those! The food and delivery service are top notch.The only thing I wished they had is some type of customer loyalty program because I would be all over that!!.- pho is a fantastic hangover cure- pho was very hearty- the lemonade was of a decent sweetness- parking is abysmal- pork sandwich was alright, iv tasted better tho  i think it could have used more meat as well- good service.Wow! The beef pho ($12.75) was actually good.On my first bite, the reminiscent smell of noodles, jalapenos, bean sprouts, beef, tendons, and the comforting soup hit me. I have had cravings for this all week hahaha. I want to try other pho places in Manhattan or Park Slope as that is where they seem to be gathered. The only thing would be that the soup could be stronger as well as being hotter. Overall, a good place to start for decent pho..The juicy ground pork in the Classic sandwich turned in a fine performance, but this wasn't a solo act, with fine harmony between the meats, bread and accompaniments. The fish sauce served with the spring rolls is almost drinkable in its excellence. The Uber Eats order was quick and the well-packed items remained warm after a long walk with many sunset pictures..Most of the dining area is closed off due to covid so they only have a few outdoor tables and three indoor ones now. This place was bussing on a Sunday night, with plenty of people picking up orders or getting takeout. Got the regular beef pho and was good, however, it comes like takeout with the soup and noodles separately. This means the meat will be raw and you for the hot broth over to cook it! The beef broth tasted really clean. The only thing is I wish it came with extra lime, cilantro, jalapeños, basil, beansprouts, etc. like pho normally does. The grilled chicken sandwich was pretty good and the Vietnamese coffee hit the spot. Some people might find the staff a bit rude but honestly I think it's the norm for asian restaurants. I love that hancos has so many vegetarian options so I will probably get those from now on!.I had the vegetarian chicken sandwich and it was a little under $8.00. When you order a sandwich they ask you what level of spiciness you want. It was pretty good and tasted like what you would expect a bahn mi to taste like. The only thing is I wish it was a little bigger for  the price. Also, while the sandwich was good I wish the vegetables and protein were more evenly distributed because when I took a bite it was difficult to get both in one bite. The wait time is not long at all. Will probably come back to try a drink!.This happens to be my favorite place to get a banh mi. And I'm talking about the kind that is very much Americanized but delicious in my taste buds opinion. I have a default order here which is the tofu banh mi, extra spicy. The regular levels of spice don't register to my Korean food trained buds. Extra spicy finally registers as mildly spicy to me. This is probably due to some additional fresh jalapeños to boost the sriracha sauced Mayo mix. I often autopilot to here cause they're generous with the vegetables added to the sandwich and I love the carrot and radish mix so much. It makes the sandwich extra good to me and also provides the interesting smell you encounter if you're eating this sandwich indoors around sensitive people. Or maybe they should just try it and not judge?They also make decent boba. The pho is not as satisfying because I can't have anything less than real home style pho anyMore. But if you need a slightly Vietnamese but not super authentic fix you'll get yours on here..If you're looking for authentic pho in New York, this is NOT the place to get it. The people working here were not Vietnamese and didn't even pronounce the word ""pho"" correctly. Nice try though, hence the two star review. Plus it was fun people-watching all the bratty kids when they got out of school for a boba treat. Interesting seeing all the kids get so excited about the straws and the new colors lmbo..I used to come here frequently. Today is my last day. I got a rice bowl with tofus $9.25. I paid an extra $4.50 for chicken. What I received was less than an ounce of chicken. The bowl was filled with rice. I am basically eating a bowl of rice. When I asked the cashier if it was a mistake and if she would give me more chicken they said no.The pictures may not even do it justice. I was fine with the 6 pieces of tofu, but the added chicken was a rip off..I've come here for many years, but finding a dead fly in the salad was too much. No response after contacting via email, and when reaching out on the phone the employee flatly said ""what do you want me to do?"". Seriously?Disgusting and somehow the response from the employee left a worst taste in my mouth than the fly would have..Below average pho. Came here on Labor Day, 8 pm on a Monday. Had the beef pho which costs $10.75 per bowl. I also took a combo banh mi (which costs $8.25) to-go, but haven't tried that yet. The pho wasn't very hot when it came out and some of the meat was unchewable. The broth was very watery and not flavorful. For that kind of quality, the price should be lower. Otherwise, I don't see how they keep business.Service is a bit strange. You have to pick up your food at the counter in the back when they call your number. Thus, there isn't really any service. I shouldn't have given a tip, since it made the overpriced food worse than it already is. Don't recommend anyone come here unless you're getting tea or something."
"I highly recommend this location had such a great time the ambience is amazing, service was amazing, and the drinks were  perfect..My anniversary has been booked here for two weeks. Received a call today, 6 hours before our reservation to tell us that the venue has been rented out for a private party ""at the last minute"". So the rest of your previous reservations mean nothing, and you absolutely do not care about guest satisfaction. This place could have the absolute best cocktails in Manhattan but they have a disregard for their guests and their time so I would steer clear. I am in complete disbelief that my anniversary plans are now ruined, thank you..Purchased a $48 deal on FeverUp that included two small plates and two hour bottomless drinks (tax and tip not included). I've never heard of this place so I didn't know what to expect. It's centrally located in the Rockefeller Center area so it's easy to get to, just a challenging to find. I found the address but it was a huge building that takes up half a block that has several businesses inside of it. Their tiny sign outside on the sidewalk is hard to read so you won't know it says ""48 Lounge"" until you walk up on it. Walked inside and the hostess greeted me and took my temperature. It wasn't crowded inside and the staff practiced social distancing with having the parties spaced out. The DJ was jamming with some classic hits and new jams. The space was huge, ultra modern, very clean and gorgeous. It reminded me of a party lounge inside of an upscale hotel or cruise ship. The stunning bar was FULLY stocked with lots of liquor choices. Practically any drink you wanted they most likely would be able to make it. I forgot to take pics of the food (YIKES) since I was so caught up in the moment, the music and tossing drinks back. I will post food pics during my next visit. I will tell you that the skillet loaded tater tots and the waygu beef sliders were AMAZING!!! I will definitely order the sliders during my next visit. Perfectly cooked,  super juicy and full of flavor. You won't be disappointed. The mini chicken and waffles were decent. They could've left the apple puree off of them. It was a bit much. The bottomless drinks were truly flowing and I definitely got my money's worth. The first hour I had peach bellinis and they were pretty tasty. Then I saw a purplish colored drink going around that a few parties were ordering and it turned out to be a blueberry mimosa. Well that was my drink for the rest of my visit. It was CRAZY GOOD!!! I'll be ordering that during my next brunch visit as well..Got a last minute reservation for 5 on a Saturday night. Good vibes, great DJ playing a mix of old & new hip-hop and rap. The drinks are strong and delicious. If you like sweet, go for the From Eden. We ordered most of the apps on the menu. The tator tots and wagyu sliders are really good, I would skip the truffle mac bites next time. Didn't try the skewers or chicken sliders myself, but my friends say they were ok. Would recommend this place for a celebration or a lowkey night out..I couldn't think of a a better venue to host my aunt's birthday party. Anthony and his team were so accommodating to our needs. They didn't miss a beat. The severs kept our glasses filled and the food flowing. Speaking of food, it was amazing. Typically lounge food can be a hit or miss, but not at 48 Lounge. My favorites from the menu were kale and pesto pizza, chicken skewers and the chicken sliders. Don't forget to ask for chipotle mayo for the sliders, life changing. Second, the DJ on Saturday night was dope. He played a mixture of old and new school. Third, the atmosphere had a beautiful decor. I would totally visit 48 Lounge again. Thank you Anthony and team for an incredible night! My family and I truly enjoyed ourselves!!.We made last minute reservations for a Friday night and so glad we could get a spot. Great vibe for a Friday night out in NYC. Drinks were fun, we tried the Mixologers Lager and the Mother of Dragons. The DJ was great and we danced until we left. Recommend and would definitely be back.A friend of mine was obsessed with this place and I can see why- to an extent.  The food is average, like really, really average.  The best thing on the menu was the tater tots which I think says enough.  The drinks, however, were really good.  However, for the price, there are better places around.  I went twice and will probably not be returning again..I came here for drinks and vibes with my sister and this place had a really nice, sexy ambience. We had reservations so we were quickly seated. There was a mixed crowd here from early 20's to 50's. There was a regular that was really inebriated and wouldn't leave me of my sister alone. Eventually he got kicked out for touching/eating our food and drinking our drinks..I went here for my sisters bday celebration and it was a blast. While the $75 ticket was only good for two hours it did include open bar and one appetizer. I decided on the grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and that filled me right up. The open bar seems like top shelf and it even included Hennessy!!!FYI: make sure your whole party arrives at the same time because they like to do ONE receipt and if people arrive at different times, that means there will be different receipts!.worst experience ever. columbia told us to come to this venue for our afterparty, and there was a huge line. waited more than an hour to get to the front, and then guess what? this willy wonka looking ass with the demeanor of gabe from the office (shown in pic) started demanding people pay to $30 just to get in even though everyone else who got in before us got in for free. and there were some old people who were let into the club even though they were clearly not columbia affiliated. there was also this 5'6 frog looking white man in a suit trying to tell people to get out of the entrance but he clearly lacked the aura of someone with authority because he seemed like a joke. anyway, don't give this club any business because they're clearly money-hungry and have a lack of respect for their customers. everyone who was leaving said it was lame too, so there's that. and also 48 lounge is a strange name for a club, please consider changing it -- it would be better for the business."
"Small and cozy...Stopped in with my family and was extremely pleased with the food and service.They were extremely accommodating and the food was fresh and delicious. Will definitely come back at a later time for good home cooking..Wow, La Essencia Restaurant was certainly amazing. It's a fun atmosphere to be in, and the menu and service is pretty great. Every single thing was fresh, healthy, and extremely tasty. Genuinely good service too. If you haven't tried this place, certainly do..Nice non-descript spot. I recommend the TACOS and half-chicken. Even the diner knockoff stuff like mozarella sticks pretty solid..For an unassuming location: the Best Oxtail Stew EVER! Fast, friendly service, the food was surprisingly good and generous serving at great price. I ate twice from my take out..The good: - the coffee is yummy- the servers are friendlyThe bad:- pastelitos not fresh (wet inside maybe from being fried when frozen).- no one speaks English wellThe ugly:- bacalao guisado was too salty & slimy (eck!)- messed up my over easy egg (was more like poached. Wet).Bottom line: they need a better cook and servers who speak English..If I can give this place 0 stars I would. I have never written a bad review in my life because I know things happen and anyone can be having a bad day, etc but an almost two hour wait for delivery?!!  This was just ridiculous. This was my third time ordering from this place. The first time it took over 30 mins for delivery and we are located  literally 3 blocks away from the restaurant. The second time the food took almost an hour to arrive. This time, and I am not joking, they took almost two hours to deliver our food. And when we called to find out what was keeping them (twice, once when it was over an hour and the second time after an hour and a half) they kept telling us that they guy had ""just left"" with our order. Horrible delivery service. Three strikes, I'm out!  Never again!.I had chicken combo, and it was suppose to come with a soda and it was never delivered with the order. Called the restaurant no one knew English, the food was ok, the texture of the chicken was good but under seasoned, and the rice was bland but they do give large amount of food for the price you pay , so basically quantity over quality, is my personal opinion.Heard from friends and coworkers that La Essencia was a good spot and ordered from them tonight for the first time. We ordered empanadas, a whole rotisserie chicken, rice, beans, and sweet plantains. The food was delivered quickly and everything was hot and fresh and delicious. The portions were plentiful. The empanadas were homemade and some of the best I've had in a long time, especially the chicken. The rotisserie chicken was flavorful and moist. The sweet plantains were nicely cooked. A really great meal!! We will certainly order from them again..I don't often write reviews but this place needs to be talked about. I stumbled upon it while waiting at the Allen Hospital/NY Presbyterian and needing a bite to eat. The food is SO DELICIOUS and they are ridiculously quick. A perfect meal. Highly suggest the rice, beans and sweet plantains. The beef stew was very good too..Looks like a little hole in the wall, but the food is really good. Cuban sandwich, chicharon de pollo and pernil are on point."
"I love this place. all my family love this place. we've been coming here for like 20 years. fresh good food. Fordham's BEST fish and chips restaurant.A neighborhood staple since my teenager years of coming to Fordham to shop, than as a local once I moved  I into the neighborhood. Their always on point with food for the pocket weary....and seasoned just right to satisfy that foodie craving. The fish is to die for and hits the spot when you want that piece of fried fish. And the fried rice has gotten better over the years.....I always want them to add more veggies and onions.........but side note that is how I like my rice..I have passed this spot for many years, and because it always seemed so busy I didn't bother to ever go in. Well I should have taken a hint that because it was busy, it was good. I decided to stop by and have No#14 with Fries(not that I needed it but I digress). I was very satisfied and have stopped by a couple of times since. It is a small place one side you order the other side you can sit on some stools and eat while looking into a mirror. It does stay busy, but the service is pretty quick..I come here almost everyday so I will be posting some pics soon. Now everything is good to eat here literally. All the food is fried so don't come asking for anything otherwise. From the chicken cutlet or fish sandwiches to the shrimp/fish with rice or fries or the cutlet with rice or fries everything is GOOD this is what I mainly order and price is really affordable for these filling plates !.The supposed owner which is the rudest chunky Asian girl you'll ever encounter has the consideration of a damn grinch; after I explained to her that her non-English speaking employee could barely inform me on how their pricing works , she"

"Tasty home made Spanish food Beans always have an amazing Flavour Excellent value for money Nice friendly staff and delivery people.I placed an order online at the restaurant below. They said they didn't receive it and that I had to pay cash to get my order, so I did that. They advised me to contact MenuStar to get a refund.Great food but be advised their online system to order, unless Uber or GrubHub, isn't functioning properly and they were unable to help me. Needless to say I have paid twice for my dinner and one way or another I'll get the refund for one back..It took over two hours to arrive. Wildly mediocre food. It arrived hot (meaning their story about having tried to deliver it before was a lie) but seemed old. Pretty bland. Also, the order was incorrect (ordered yellow rice, got white rice) after all that time. Stay away..I'll be as honest and straight forward as can be. I work 3 blocks away and this is the only spanish restaurant closest to me. Today's visit would make it my 6th visit for take out. I remember the 1st and 2nd visit I ordered a large oxtail with rice, charged me $8. 3rd visit charged me $9 for a large. Thought the price went up, no problem. 4th time I was charge $8 but the old nasty lady spoke in Spanish to tell this other lady to charge me $9. I also asked for a side of chicken leg and was told by the first lady that was serving me that it would be $2.50. Then the nasty old lady chimes in and told her to charge me $4.50. I paid anyway because the food was already prepared and I don't like to cause trouble. 5th time charged me $9...ok I hope it stays consistent. Today they gave me a SMALL platter of oxtail with rice, same thing I ordered every visit and charged me $10. I kindly asked why they keep changing the price on me meanwhile all my visits were in a 3 month span. With a loud and unrespectful tone and broken English, the old nasty lady said: you want or no? I walked out. They have no prices listed anywhere. Not even a menu with prices. They make their prices on the fly depending who goes. Oh by the way, one of my worker is Mexican, he was the one that put me up on the restaurant. I told him that they make up prices on the fly. He laughed and said because you don't speak their language so they will take advantage of you..Very upset that after i order food and it never comes. I called them several times and they lied saying its on its way. It should be there soon. Ive never experienced this before. They dont value the customers that keep them in business. Dint waste your time with them. You will end up going to bed hungry because your food never came.This review is for the owner. They installed a broken exhaust systemOn their roof and it has sounded like jackhammers outside our building for 24/7 for the last week. They refuse to fix it. We have babies in our building that can't sleep due to the high decibel noise. When we spoke to the owner he didn't care. Don't patronize this business..My friend and I stopped in yesterday for what we were hoping would be a quick bite. We were the only customers in the restaurant. After 20 minutes of waiting for one mofongo dish and one burrito, we were told they didn't have one of the burrito ingredients. So we ordered a basic quesadilla, figuring that would be quick. Nope. 15 minutes later we left a few bucks on the table for the bottles of water and walked out. The music was ridiculously loud, and the employees/owners were having what appeared to be some sort of party in the front, with drinks and lots of laughing.I don't begrudge anyone a good time, but if you don't want to be serving food, put up the We're Closed sign and lock the door..Typical mom and pop restaurant in East Williamsburg. Good food and nice staff. I mainly have the octopus salad with tostones which is AMAZING!!! Music here could be loud but if it's too loud they'll accommodate and lower it for you..DISGUSTING!! I just took my daughter here to eat in hopes of a fresh baked chicken combo.  The chicken and rice are old! The beans tasted sour and the service was horrible. Never again!.Omg I been sick for two day from eating here!!! Cuban sandwich and steak sandwich.. after 30 min my stomach started hurting me and I been going to the bathroom every 10 min... I may have to go to dr...."
"I took myself out on a solo date here last night and it did not disappoint. Everyone who was working was incredibly nice and welcoming. Ryan was wonderful, he was attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly, and Guillermo, the sommelier, was fantastic. He answered all my questions about the wine, gave great recommendations, and worked with me on a substitution for the Chardonnay as I'm not a fan.I had the chef's tasting menu with the sommelier wine pairing. All the food was wonderful, timed out perfectly, and the 7 courses left me full but not overly so. The butternut squash was my favorite course, followed very closely to the steak tartare.I look forward to returning soon..Ambiance/interior design: 4/5This restaurant sits in the Langham hotel. The hotel interior design is on the classic end, instead of modern. There are flowers outside the hotel and  on the stairs leading up to the restaurant, which I thought was really cool. Service: 4/5The servers are very nice and polite but the dishes took a long time to be served.Food: 3/5I had very high expectations before visiting the restaurant, because it has one Michelin star and I heard great things about it from my friends. However, I was definitely disappointed. The only dish that I liked was the squid ink pastas. As a pasta lover, I think the sauce was perfectly flavored and pasta tasted like it was handmade. However, all the other dishes tasted somewhat weird. Either too salty, too sour, or just not enough flavor. Additionally, this restaurant is not cheap, so I didn't think the food was worth the price I paid..Uh-oh. Guess I'm going against the grain among a sea of ""Zomg, my first Michelin-starred restaurant!!!!1"" and ""We celebrated our aNniVeRsAry here!!!!"" 5-star reviews.Ai Fiori was average at best. We did the four-course prix fixe and got the Tartare di Carne and Polipo to start; the Trofie Nero and Spaghetti for pasta; the Astice as both entrees; and the Torta di Limone and Cubetto di Cioccolato for dessert. To imbibe, we got the Royal Blush and the Rubies and Roses.In terms of technique, the dishes/drinks were all prepared, cooked and presented well. But nothing was particularly noteworthy, and some things like the Astice had me scratching my head. Why pair a succulent lobster tail, lentils and savory buerre sauce, with julienned apple drowning in sour vinaigrette? The vinaigrette was so pungent that I couldn't even enjoy the lobster and lentils because it kept seeping into that side of the plate--and the smell was awful.Where Ai Fiori really lost me was the service. Our server was nice but barely there. It took us 10 minutes of sitting at our table with no menus before she even appeared. And trying to flag her just to get the bill was a 20-min exercise in frustrating futility. I know restaurants are struggling with service issues right now, but there were so many staff milling around that I don't think this particular case was due to to a lack of personnel. It just seemed like poor organization.Clientele is a mix of old white men who look like extras on Billions, trustafarians, trendy couples, and botoxed ladies who look like extras on Real Housewives.I've had better experiences at pasta restaurants with no Michelin stars. Ai Fiori was a letdown..My bf took us for Valentine's Day. After tips and tax, the meal came up to $650 for two people. The question is, was it worth it? The tasting menu was truly incredible!We started off with the canapé. Foie gras mousse, chocolate,brioche. This was more like a dessert. It was super creamy, sweet yet savory? I wouldn't want to have foie gras any other way ever again. Crudo di capesanteTorched scallops miso yuzu pearls and calabrian peppersWas absolutely genius. We love the yuzu pearls and how it added such a nice touch to the eye and texture to the taste. The Calabrian pepper was more of a garnish to me than to add flavor to the dish. PolipoOctopus a la piastra, gigante beans, guancile, the squid was cooked to perfection, to plate it with beans was unique and definitely worked out really well. Risotto Riso acquerello, lobster, apple, stracciatella, chives.The lobster was perfect, the apples crunchy sweet notes help balance out the creamy risotto.agnolotti Veal breast ravioli, butter, parmigiano, truffle, sugo. We were so excited to try their handmade pastas. It was a truffle heaven on a plate. If you are a truffle lover you would have loved this! The veal was so tender and flavorful. ippoglossoPan-seared halibut, sunchoke, Brussels sprouts, meyer lemons. Brussel sprouts is not a popular vegetable amongst most people we know, including my boyfriend, however, whatever they did to the brussel sprouts, got my boyfriend wanting more. It was absolutely delicious. We had no idea white fish was suppose to be JUICY?? It was the most incredible bite ever! The top was seared to a perfect crisp, while the fish's white silky meat melts in your mouth. stracottoBraised herb crust short rib, polenta, turnips, bordelaise was so tender, you didn't even need a knife to break it apart. The meat was extremely rich in flavor as well. The polenta on the side was perfect, we loved the mini carrot and turnip garnish, the plating reminds me of a garden in your backyard. Absolutely adorable.For the intermezzo, we had lemon sorbet. We wouldn't want to clean our palate any other way.Lastly for dessert, I got the tiramisu and my bf got this vegan dessert that wasn't on the menu. The tiramisu was PERFECT. Honestly I did not think such a dainty bite could be so perfect. The chocolate sorbet wasn't too sweet either. Almost like dark chocolate. The vegan dessert was lovely. My bf loved his dessert, the syrupy yet light dessert won his heart. Overall this spot was a delicious delight. The creativity put into each dish blew our minds. The service was amazing as well, we had the best Valentine's Day..Spectacular. Service is unparalleled, ambiance is super classy. Happy hour is a strict 5-6 pm on weekdays but they're super accommodating and remind you to put all your drink orders in before it wraps up at 6. The appetizer-size pastas ($15) are my favorite, especially the trofie nero. Best squid ink pasta I've had with its scallops and breadcrumbs, very evenly balanced. My husband loves the Ai Fiori burger and orders it every happy hour. As for drinks, our favorite is the Rubies & Roses punch. It has some rose water and tea in it - I could literally drink a gallon of it, not even joking. Goes down super smooth and very refreshing. It's like an adult, slightly muted and elevated version of an Açaí Strawberry refresher from Starbucks with rose instead of strawberry. Simply amazing. This is our favorite happy hour places in Manhattan and we're going to keep coming back!.Made a reservations for an anniversary dinner two months in advance. Highly recommend making a reservation. We dined at 6:15pm on a snowy, cold January Thursday, and every table was full. The bar was available for those looking for a drink.Service was impeccable. Our waitress was friendly, warm, professional, and accommodating. We were checked upon the right amount of times, and did not feel bothered or rushed. You are allotted two hours for your dinning experience, when making reservations online, but if you dine on a weekday, and not on peak times, you will be able to enjoy for as long as you'd like, which is what we did.The ambiance is relaxing, classy, and understated-upscale. Definitely dress up, although plenty of diners were donning casual attire. Pleasant music playing on the background. Perfect for a special occasion.Prices warrant the special occasion. The food menu is not very extensive, and prices are not cheap. Portions are small-this is an experience to savor. Waiters recommend the pre-fix tasting menus [$114 per person for four courses, or $175 per person for seven courses]. We went with ordering a la carte.Complementary bread and butter are served. Don't be shy to ask for seconds.$25 lobster soup was delicious. However, it was served without croutons or black truffles, like claimed in the menu. Very delicate flavor. The lobster pieces were super fresh and tender--you could tell that the lobster was still crawling earlier that day.$37 for all pastas and risottos. Pastas are made in-house daily, and you could tell by the taste and texture. Trofie Nero was slightly piquant and bursting with flavor. Tiny scallops were fresh and tender, as well as seppia and mollica [variation of squid]. Recommend this dish. Pasta was slightly chewy, which I like. Spaghetti was tasty as well. Tarragon really added flavor to the garlic butter sauce. Blue crab was super delicate, but there was very little of it compared to the amount of pasta.$15 for all desserts. Torta di limone was a let-down not only for us but also for the table next to us, who ordered the same thing. The flavors were very understated and something was missing. Subtly sweet, not your typical American overpowering sweet. This dessert needed an element of highlight, to make it memorable and complete. Also, it was supposed to be served with ice scream, but that was not the case that night.Cubetto di cioccolato was the highlight of our meal. This was a truly spectacular dessert. It was complex, intricate, and well-thought out. Every element was perfectly designed to complement all the ingredients and the composition of the dish. Not sweet, but earthy and savory, the focus of this dessert on black sesame bean. Every element incorporated black sesame in some way, from ice cream to ganache to filling to chocolate. I enjoyed every bite and tried to savor it for as long as I could. Definitely get this.Amazing experience!Beautiful place, very nice people, super tasty food! We were celebrating the anniversary here..definitely the right place for it!.I celebrated my anniversary at Ai Fiori, and it was a heavenly experience. From the moment we entered, the staff made us feel at home. Everyone - from the reception to the kitchen staff to our waiter wished us a happy anniversary - it was so thoughtful. I had the prix-fix with wine pairing. I began with the beef tartare and it was lovely. I continued with the lobster risotto and the rice was cooked perfectly and the serving of lobster was generous. My entree was the butter poached lobster and it was cooked perfectly and garnished with a light sauce and vegetables. Ai Fiori offers free bread and the staff even offered us a second helping - the bread and butter were among the best I've ever had. The chocolate dessert was simply delicious, and the warm wish for a happy anniversary was the perfect ending for a perfect meal. Service was polished and professional and the setting was lovely..One Michelin star restaurant. My first one in NY and what a lovely place it was. We just got off the plane FYI and this was our first meal. Greeted with smiles upon arrival with friendly conversations, took our coats, checked our vaccination cards, and greeted my littles as well.They purposely gave us a nice corner booth because they knew we had two littles and prepared it for us (way to win my heart team ) which was much needed, as you can see from the pictures. Food was delicious, service was excellent, atmosphere was delightful and bathrooms were clean. I would definitely come back and highly recommended! Thank you for starting my NY trip with a win!.Wow -- our dinner here was incredible. First of all, the service is impeccable -- the entire staff is incredibly kind and attentive. Not more than a minute of finishing our courses went by without them clearing and cleaning the table.The food was delicious -- for two, we shared: the Polipo, Trofie Nero, and Anatra. The octopus was tender, charred perfectly, and came with delicious bits of pancetta with dabs beans. The trofie nero came in a light sauce with perfectly cooked scallops and toasted breadcrumbs (incredible). The duck was perfectly cooked with a sunchoke and pistachios -- my personal favorite dish of the meal.We had such a lovely experience here and would absolutely return in a heartbeat!"
"I've been here a few times over the last 2 months that but I always forget to take pics. There's always a line so I recommend you go early. Only 5 people allowed in at a time. The food has been consistently good and they give you a nice portion. Fresh food is constantly being brought out. I've never seen anything look old. The ladies are friendly and they have an efficient system to get people in and out. Today I had rasta pasta with chicken and curry goat. Everything was seasoned well and delicious with one minor thing the pasta was slightly overcooked but nevertheless it was all devoured. ++Masks and gloves are worn here.Went here for a patty on a Saturday Morning. First thing - this place is super small. Due to COVID they only allow 3 customers inside at a time . Very clean place . My mild beef patty w/ cheese and coco bread , was great. I will come by again..Bottom Line: Okay the food here is bomb! Sometimes their customer service is a bit off... just ignore it. Food: I really have only had a couple of experiences where it was a ""miss"" situation (it might depend on the day?). Overall, I can count on this place to be really good-- not AMAZING all the time - but reliably good.Service: Child just get your food and go! Sometimes they just straight up don't even look at you which is a little weird, but I've just gotten used to it lol.Atmosphere: Casual, not a sit down place. Don't bring wifey here to chill!Overall, still a staple in my book..I ate here EVERYDAY for a week while I was in NYC.The food was just that good.Brown stewed chicken was amazing..Jamaican food so goo that you have to be careful not to bite your finger tips off when eating. I am not sure about these reviews but aside from OG's on linden and the door. This Jamaican food spot delivers every time ""consistently"" which is not a word associated with Jamaican restaurants.I highly recommend visiting the one on Springfield and Merrick Blvd..Jamaican food so good that you have to be careful not to bite your finger tips off when eating. I am not sure about these reviews but aside from OG's on linden and the door. This Jamaican food spot delivers every time ""consistently"" which is not a word associated with Jamaican restaurants.I highly recommend visiting the one on Springfield and Merrick Blvd..Tried this place yesterday for the first time , the fried chicken was really good and also the Rasta pasta that was my favorite, the Mac and cheese wasn't what I expected. The cheese taste like cheddar cheese and it taste cheap..As one of the few people traveling from New Jersey for Jamaican Flavors, I should point that this a small take-out spot with no seating. I didn't research such details. Since they had a picture of the jerk sandwich I thought that was the way to go. I figured a sandwich and a patty would be convenient products for train station dining. This was incorrect. A massive flood of jerk sauce wound up on my pants. For the rest of my travels I tried to conceal the damage with a newspaper. But if you're in a safer environment, you should indeed try this sandwich. It isn't especially smoky or spicy, but has a kind of a sweet vibe. This may not be taken as the compliment it's intended to be, but it felt like a more exotic relative of the McRib.The callaloo and saltfish patty was pretty good. It leaned to the vegetable side of things so it isn't ideal for fish fanatics..They give you more rice and peas than anything! I knew I shouldve walked out when he skipped over me to assist a man that walked in after me! Then, they didn't even have cabbage but proceeded to add ""salad"". It was a few pieces of shredded lettuce and one slice of tomato what a joke! Wish there was more stew chicken for $8.50 to leave a true review. Used to come here all the time as a kid should've got a beef patty and left!.Best patties! Also had the jerk chicken platter and it was so flavorful, juicy, and tender. Friendly vibes!.I had curry chicken with rice and peas, and veggies. The food was bland. No flavor. at. ALL! Rice tastes like nothing. Chicken tastes like nothing. Veggies tasted like peas. It was odd and unpleasant.Update: now I feel sick."
"I used to order from here years ago. Ordered again today, the customer service over the phone was great and the delivery was super quick but the food was not what it used to be all. I hope they go back to their standards.I was looking forward to going back to this spot and I finally decided to go this weekend, but honestly it was a disappointment. I didn't get what I ordered and I had to wait 50 minutes to get cold soggy fries. And not to mention that even though we were waiting there for our food. Friends of the establishment would  just show up and place their orders and literally get it within minutes. That was offputting and the fact that I waited 50 minutes and the food was not okay even pipping hot. The only thing I enjoyed was the mirror soñando..I went here for the first time last night to order some take out. By far, one of the worse customer service I've ever experienced. The food is good but now worth the time. First and last time for me..After placing our order, we were told it would take about 45 minutes to receive our food. We never received it. When calling to inquire about our meal, we were told that the delivery person would be on their way in 10 minutes. Here we are, 2 hours later, no food. And the establishment is closed. Horrible service..Overpriced and horrible wait time! They raised prices because of Covid and the service was atrocious. Bread with chicken took 30 minutes and the order was still wrong.Attitude was very nasty towards black ppl and nice to Spanish.. the young guy that was taking orders said in Spanish too many black ppl.. wtf he mean.. anyway the staff needs to be educated on their  history.. I will never ever go back to any establishment again.. IJust walked out and it was like a 100 dollar order.. I'm african and speak fluent Spanish.So i places an order on 03/02/2020 at 6:18pm through grubhub. I ordered a yaroa of chicken and french fries. And they sent me a plantain one. I got a chimi of beef meat and the meat was raw and pink inside. When I called the restaurant she told me they can't do refunds that I needed to call customer service. But I have previous grub hub experience and in the same section where they charge extra on a order they can do a refund on it too so the lady lied. This place has poor work ethics and untrained employees. I will not be ordering from them again..Food is delicious I had the chicken mofongo yummy Everything on the menu looks awesome will return to try more from menu nice place to sit and enjoy your food.This place used to be sooo good, then they started adding American cheese to all their empanadas with no option to remove it. Absolutely disgusting. Pls hire the old chief back, this is a disgrace to what once was a great place..This Place use to be so good , food , service,  environment,  etc. Ordered 2 - Picaio Platters ,Pernil, Pollo , Tostones.  4 - Ham & Cheese Empanadas,  2- Chinolas.  Took over 45 minutes for the order to be ready. I get home happy ready to eat my food , open it up and it looks horrible plus the order was wrong . Instead of Pernil they gave me Beef , neither the Chicken nor the Beef was cut up like it's supposed to be . They didn't even probably cook the Tostones , how you mess that up ? The Empanadas had so much Oil they could've cook 100 Pork Chops in it . These new worker's are horrible.. very disappointed!!! Manny fix it up quick !!!"
"Ok. This place is amazing. First off, if you are going to Russ & Daughters next door for breakfast, just go ahead and place your order for your sandwich and then sidle up to the bar (or the new outside dining spaces NYC is doing) and grab yourself a breakfast cocktail. Particularly, the Nitro Cold Brew Irish Coffee and the Tuscan Rickey are delicious. And cocktails in NYC that aren't $18+? Sold. Let's also talk about our bartender, Bronson. The best kind of character. Cool, full of great stories, personable, and been working here for over five years. Which is pretty wild for NYC bartenders. No idea why this place only has 3.5 stars as of this setting, because this is a great experience..WORST BAR I'VE EVER BEEN TOO. We visited from California and had a New Yorker show us around. Note we're all Asian. We showed them our ID's and the bartender singled out the only New Yorker, and singled him out for his REAL ID.  Mind you our friend LIVES in New York, yet they assumed that his ID was fake. They even swiped his ID and they said it went through, but the bartender claimed that there are swipeable fakes. Our New Yorker friend was even willing to show the bartender their passport card, but the bartenders turned us away explicitly because we were the only group of Asians in a densely populated white bar. I advise against going to this establishment especially if you are Asian, because they will discriminate against you..Yo. This place is the epitome of average. But a regular staple in our drinking joints. We've been coming here for what...probably five years? It's a great end of the night place. The bartenders are mostly attentive and the clientele isn't too annoying. They've raised prices during Covid. But who can blame them. I wouldn't go out of my way to spend the night here. Good place to meet up and then move. Or good place to end. They do have a secret bathroom in the back of the bar. Good way to avoid the long lines in front. Usually filled with people doing coke or couples being silly. It's kind of a hot mess, but whatever..Ugh! I hate writing bad reviews but I feel the need to warn. We loved the vibe, the bartenders, the music everything - except that they upsold us from beer to a pitcher of their specialty cocktail (which there's no shame in up selling, that's fine!!). The problem was there was definitely little to no booze in the whole pitcher of what turned out to be Arnold Palmer. We were really disappointed that they would recommend it, AND the waiter we had said they had sold over 75 pitchers that day. To me that screams ripoff, and I walked out feeling pretty mislead. Ultimately, I would recommend going with a beer or shot, something that can't be diluted. But I personally, will not be returning..Lucky's Jack in NYC is a chill ass bar which cool ass bartenders. If you are waiting for Russ and Daughters, do yourself the favor and come here for a quick drink. My friend and I came here to have a quick drink before we went to Russ and Daughters Café next door for lunch and had a wonderful time!  We walked in and were greeted right away; instantly felt a homey and cozy vibe feel once we walked in. We sat at the bar and admired the décor and design in the bar. There is also more seating in the back. The bartender was chill and gave us a drink menu to look over. We ordered simple drinks and enjoyed our time people watching. Everyone was very friendly here and the service was great. My drink was delicious and stiff, just the way I like it.You will see many locals that come here to enjoy their evening here. They have everything from cocktails, beers on draft, Scotch, Irish, American, and Bourbon, as well as regional brews.They have TVs around the bar for patrons! Also, they allow you to bring food inside.If you are interested in hosting a party or a graduation party, this is the perfect place to do it! Make sure you ask about their private lounge! This is a great place to just stop in when you need a little ""pick-me-up""!.Really enjoyable atmosphere and drinks, and very kind owners and bartender in this otherwise unassuming, overlooked bar..Trashhhhhhh would rate 0 stars if I could.... kicked us out bc one person brought a white claw, and didn't rush to throw it out.... disgusting and was dead but were still rude????.Just recently moved to the hood and discovered this gem Cool  place, great bartenders nestled off the beat n path of LES. Love this place.Lucky Jack's is a solid LES choice for any weeknight. The bar has a homey feel and the brick is cozy. There is never too many people here during the week, which allows good conversation and I never feel like I'm screaming over loud music. I enjoy standing or sitting on a stool near the window- which you can open and people watching. The bartenders have always been very attentive and nice. I've gotten a few of the cocktails. The Blueberry bourbon lemonade is my favorite. Nothing too wild as far as cocktail selection. I mostly come here for the low-key neighboorhood vibe. (Keep in mind I've never been here on a Friday or Saturday night.) I also recommend their free comedy shows downstairs- I want to say it happens on Wednesdays, but I could be wrong. I've seen some really great shows, and ones that needed a bit more practice, but hey- that's the beauty of free comedy- you never know what you are going to get. 4/5.Great place for cocktails! Service and drinks by Bronson were five stars. We stopped on mid-day Saturday, sat outside, ordered food from next door. Their Tuscan Rickey is the best Rickey I've had (I don't typically like rockets and ordered two because they were so delicious). My husband ordered the nitro cold brew which has whiskey in it (no dairy) and it was fantastic!! This is a regulars hangout spot, not touristy, not college bar scene. Definitely recommend stopping in if you're in the area or making an out of the way spot.  Outdoor and indoor dining available."
"B & Co is just amazing. The atmosphere, the service, the menu. Every thing I've tried so far has been wonderful. The staff was great, literally every one. Overall, would definitely come back..Avoid like the plague! They promote ""specials"" for each weekday, but don't even have it at the hot food bar. During a weekday lunch rush, there was no chicken or salmon. Adding on to that, the make your own grain / pasta bowl guy gave me carrots when I asked for broccoli and even tried to accuse me of telling him the wrong thing. He had such a bad attitude and zero patience. Like whose mans is this?! Thankfully, another customer defended me when the guy denied I told him ""broccoli"". I guess ""carrots"" is close alphabetically so nice try? The pesto in my pasta was all oil and not enough herbs. It made me feel a bit queasy after lunch. The only saving grace is the nice renovated space and the friendly cashier..Wow, the reviews on here are harsh. I've personally never had a problem with B & Co. The sandwiches are made fresh, and they're pretty quick about it. I mean, yeah, these aren't the most amazing sandwiches ever, but they're fine. I guess my main gripe is that it's a little expensive, but that's more or less standard in the financial district..If you like the guy making your food completely wrong, and then threatening to fight you, this is your place. Here's my story: I walk in and order a wrap with eggs, avocado, spinach and salsa. Trying to be somewhat healthy. I also get a coffee and I'm putting honey in it so I don't watch the guy make my food. I go upstairs and open it and it's eggs, bacon, and salsa. I call down and tell them what happened and reorder. I bring the old wrap back. I tell the guy hey, you put bacon in here. He says, you told me bacon! I said dude, I don't eat bacon. He says, no, you told me bacon! I said don't put f'ing words in my mouth. He said you want to go outside? I said, seriously? You want to fight? He said yeah, I do, but I have customers, I'm going to remember your face. I was like wow, this dude is just looking for trouble. I think he has a hearing problem because everyone at my office has had stuff made wrong in there..I do like their breakfast sandwiches. A nice selection of bread to choose from.Lunch sandwiches are pricy. Chicken cutlet with Swiss and a seltzer 11$and change..Went there to grab lunch today, and the things that I heard... there was this guy calling the other f*ggot and the others joined to make not very good comments. If you speak Spanish and go to eat here, you should know what I'm talking about, my question is where is the manager at??? They don't know they can get a HUGE lawsuit??? Just plain disrespectful, never coming again..Because I was going here at prime lunch time and figured it would be busy, I looked online to see what I might want to eat.  When I ordered at the counter the man said, ""I don't know what that is.""  I said, ""Well, it's on your menu.""  His reply?  ""I don't have access to that, only you do.""  And then he turned and took someone else's order.  So I left because he could not have cared less about his job.  WORST..still a 3 star and yes, the pickles are still lousy but it won't stop me from being a customer.LOUSY  PICKLES !This is one of our regular lunch delivery choices.  They have a pretty large menu  so we can usually find something  for just about all of  The folks in the office. The food is good, the delivery is usually fast  but the pickles are lousy.   I will admit that I favor full sour picked and they serve half sour or new pickles.  We throw away the pickles first.My wife and I wanted a New York bagel. I thought it was good overall. We split a bacon egg and cheese bagel on a plain bagel and then had a flat everything bagel. The cream cheese was ok, wish there was more. The bagel sandwich came out great. They also seemed to have a bar full of fresh salads and sides. Overall it was a good meal!.I go here just about EVERY morning for breakfast sandwich. I ordered Egg & Cheese with Turkey bacon on a roll....Now  I am standing there watching this guy make my food as I do EVERY morning. He takes 2 rolls and place egg & cheese on each sandwich, then add PORK bacon to BOTH the QUICKLY removes the PORK bacon from 1 sandwich and places the TURKEY bacon on the eggs. Wraps it and says it my order. Now I know what I just saw...I saw to him did u just take pork off of that sandwich and place turkey bacon on it instead. This man blatantly lied right to my face and says no I didn't. I say AGAIN tell the truth because if I eat this I will get sick AGAIN he lies and says he didn't switch the bacon. I cant even get my money back as I already paid. The cashiers watch you like a HAWK soon as you order they are getting your attention so you can pay!!!...I was sooooo ANGRY that this man lied I called the owner Robert to complain. IMMEDIATLEY he apologizes and offers me another meal that he will prepare himself. (NOT INTERESTED) I really hope he is stern with the cook as the next person he does this too may not be so understanding. I walked passed this morning and I see the same cook at the grill. I will NOT be spending my money here anymore. Not to mention the prices change without notice and they add tax to EVERYTHING!!! If you order here....WATCH TH COOK make your food!!!"
"Pretty good catering from what I experienced. It was a catered meeting breakfast but I was surprised at how tasty the egg wraps were. They also had an assortment of sweets (doughnuts, cinnamon buns, etc) which I abstained from. The coffee was also hot and awesome, even though it was delivered. Great job.The food was delivered late but I don't know if I could fault the place for that or the people who were hosting the meeting.Recommend for breakfast..One of the few lunch spots in the area that isn't too crowded on a weekday. All sorts of items available for quick eats; made our way to the back for the salad section which had no line.Decided on the Shanghai Chicken Salad ($12.50) - which comes with chicken, edamame, scallions, almonds, cilantro, red cabbage, all over romaine. Decent amount of food, could have used more chicken inside but the salad itself is pretty filling. Vinaigrette is sweet without being overbearing (always take the low-volume option on dressing). Basic overall lunch without much of a wait. Don't have a chopped option for salads, and it is a bit expensive, but fine enough for a visit once a week..So.... This place is usually good! But seems like they are really cheap u would think for a 15.00 salad it would be a decent size salad!!!! WRONG  it looks like they recently bought smaller Bowles and prices still the same save your money better going to a deli. Owner is rude as well !.I'm trying to use these guys instead of sweetgreen a block away because I like their ingredients in theory. However, the quality is so bad. Last week the chicken was hard (like it was over cooked and then frozen and then defrosted that morning) and I had to pick it out of my salad after spending $3 extra for it. Today I ordered a salad without chicken, and the avocado was rubbery and again I'm not eating the most expensive item in the salad. Both times the lime was old - dry and not a drop of juice comes out of it. I looked in the app for feedback but the button to send feedback directly to them didn't work, so here we are..Always a one star in customer service. The girl behind the cashier hardly smiles, frowns when asks to heat up soup which is always lukewarm.only reason I stay there is because food is okay..even then the cook is always angry because he is burdened by soo many orders that he has to manhandle alone.Always sat down there n I am vaccinated but didn't have a card, was rejected like a piece of shit...Let me tell you, fresh&co was truly something else. It was very reasonably priced. I am really happy that we had Smoked Tofu Edamame Bowl, this was one of their best dishes, extremely flavorful and delicious. All of the staff are super pleasant - you truly feel welcome and looked after. I definitely recommend and would come again!.This is the only Fresh&Co location I've been to. In my book, Fresh&Co is one of those health-nut shops that have recently appeared throughout the city. The employees here are very welcoming and friendly. I've ordered from the LevelUp app that actually provides a $10-15 reward when you first come here. There is a rewards program if you use the app so I highly recommend downloading it. You can save yourself a meal someday. On that day, I ordered the Baked Falafel Bowl, which was very filling. It was also very healthy and provided a great number of fresh ingredients and nutrients. It is also on the lower-end pricing when you compare the price to other healthy salad/healthy bowl stores. It tastes very similar to a Dig Inn bowl. When I went to pick up my order, it was ready. On other days, I've gotten the Avocado Chicken Grab&Go Sandwich from the front of the store. I also got the Albacore Tuna Salad Sandwich as well as the Cranberry Turkey Salad Sandwich. While the sandwiches are a bit overpriced ($8.95-$10) for two slices of sandwich, they are incredibly healthy. I've also gotten the albacore tuna salad as a side as well as coconut curry chicken salad. Decent portions, a little pricey, but that is expected of a store on the Upper East Side that specializes in healthy foods.  I've also gotten the Berry Classic, Greek Yogurt Parfait, and Acai Goodness as well as the different selections of Brew Dr. Kombucha. These are all great sides to get for your $15 lunch. You can definitely eat very healthy from this place if your budget is $15. There are so many options to choose from. This place is obviously a frequent place that I visit..Fresh &  Co. specializes in customized salads. Upon entrance, customers can approach the station from which they would like to place an order. The basics are to choose a lettuce type followed by toppings. This place probably works better in theory than in reality unless you order from a preselected menu of salads that include multiple toppings for a relatively reasonable price. The average salad is generous in size, but will run you approximately $11 upward. Being practical, this is just unreasonable to charge for lettuce and the small quantity of toppings that they add on top. I decided to do the 'create your own' salad. It includes four basic toppings, extras such as cheese or otherwise will cost around $1 more. This can get pretty pricey if you would like more than the plain basics. The staff here were super patient and helpful when explaining our orders. I would hesitatingly return again, if only to try a different menu item other than the salad. Although my salad was good, it was very difficult to justify the ranking system for how the determine which topping will cost an extra fifty cents to a dollar. These small up-charges can easily lead to fairly pricey salad. The saying is true, to be healthy can cost more!.Horrible, Horrible experience found a insect in my food. I would never eat here nor recommended anyone else, manager was so inconsiderate towards this. Simply thought issuing a refund was the answer..I've visited a few different Fresh & Co locations around the city and the service and food are generally good. The salad section is always the most popular, but the servers move very quickly. Other stations, like the rice bowls, get less of a crowd. Oddly enough, service is better here during the lunch rush than it is later in the day. I stopped by after work and the staff seemed distracted and too busy carrying on a conversation. I don't mind waiting if there's a line, but not if I'm the only customer in the store. As far as food goes, the build-your-own salads are good. My favorite menu options are the falafel salad and barbecue jackfruit."
"My friend is Haitian and really wanted some Haitian patties, so I went on Yelp to search for a place in Queens near where I work to get some. I place my order online before arriving. The employee had a hard time understanding me which is understandable as I tend to speak soft, and I don't think he completely understood what I was saying. I ended up ordering a dozen patties, along with 2 more individual ones. I got a mix of chicken, fish, herring, and beef. I arrived at 5:30pm, and I was able to find street side parking very easilly, there is 1hr. parking, and the parking meter is very close to the bakery. They offer soups, breads, pastries, and store made juices and drinks. I think the worker spoke French, he was very friendly and even gave me the 2 other patties for free. The patties were very hot and smelled amazing.  My friend loved the patties, and so did my family they're a bit spicy and so full of flavor and smokiness. I will definately return again to try some of the other baked goods they offer. They have changed their store hours by the way, the website says 8pm, but this bakery closes at 6pm. During this time only 2 people are allowed in the store at once, and they do have a plastic barrier put up at the cashier..Of the best place to purchase Haitian patties and bread. The patties are always delicious and fresh. Social distancing and masks is being practiced..The Hatian patties are baked fresh and so delicious. My favorite is the cod fish patty and the smoked herring patty. They also have sweet pastrieS and they have this almond cookie cake (don't know the name) which is so damn delish. The people that work there are so nice too. I'm so glad a lovely bakery like this is by my workplace. Each patty is 1.25 but a dozen is $12..Patties are really good...chicken,beef,herring and spinach. I also had an apple turnover...so yummy..OMG do not sleep on this place. Their patties are exceptional.  The herring one are orgasmic..... YASSSSS!.Hands down, hands up, and wave them all around... the BEST Haitian bakery I have been to on the east coast. I originally came here in search of patties for a holiday party. They are moderately priced, but the quality of everything I have tasted in that bakery makes it worth every cent and more. The patties were light and flaky with plenty filling to make your mouth water. Everything from the bread, croissant, pastries to the fresh and daily made drinks, porridge, and patties, this small shop is absolutely underrated. I will admit that you may not always get someone on the phone if you call, but to me, that is so arbitrary juxtaposed to the value you receive by ordering from the bakery. All the ingredients are fresh, flavorful, and not overly sweet or salty. A must try bakery!.believe me when I tell you don't waste your time or money! products very bland no taste at all. Much more bakery's on Jamaica ave 212th that you get much more taste for your buck!.It's a shame that a place with such a great product has such horrible service.  My order at their Brooklyn location was not fulfilled, even after confirming it. Margaret, if that's her real name, at their Queens location treated me terribly and refused to assist me. It saddens me that we continue to disappoint our names and reputations by being terrible at customer service..Haitian friends told me this was absolutely the best Haitian bakery anywhere, and I found out they were right.  My favorite item is their spinach patties, followed by the codfish patties; both are flaky, delicate, non-greasy and filled with a delicious filling.  They have 3 other pattie flavors, which I'm sure are also delicious.  I've had their bread, croissants, pastry desserts - all are terrific.  My church used to buy patties from another Haitian bakery in the neighborhood; but I think we all have had a conversion to La Baguette.  Also, when I have visitors from out of town, picking up several patties is a must in their NYC food experience.If you buy a dozen patties, you will get a significant price break..As a Haitian woman there is nothing I more than embracing the foods of my culture.  Last Friday during  the last day of one of my clinical rotations my instructor brought some patties. 4 DOZEN to be exact.  She purchased one for the staff and the rest for the group. The flavors varied from spinach, cod fish, herring, chicken and beef. I had the chocken and it was delicious.  The rest of my group devoured the patties as some never had Haitian patties before. And not too long after people had a case the itis"
"Came by today to give them another try. I noticed they put walls up at the counter- perhaps because of my comment about the cook using his shirt as a towel? With the walls up, it was very quiet and you can't hear any action in the kitchen.Ordered chicken wings + spicy miso ramen with pork chashu (thick noodles). Order scallop $1 as extra topping as I was curious about how it would taste in my ramen. I never noticed it on the menu and I never seen it at other ramen shop.Everything tasted hot and delicious. The scallop didnt have any flavor- perhaps just boiled? No other seasoning found. The chicken wings were nicely fried (crisp) and juicy, yum.I still wonder about their hygiene practice, especially behind the walls..Came today for lunch around 12:45pm. Place was empty and dark (waitress turn the lights on after seated me). I sat in front at the bar so I could see the action. Temperature taken and hand sanitized before sitting. No one was manning the kitchen, so the waitress started working on my fried dumplings. I watched her place the frozen ones onto the griddle as the cook finally arrive.Food: 3 starsService: 4 starsOverall: 2.5-3 starsI rated low #s of stars because the sight of the cook using his shirt to wipe his sweaty forehead twice and return to touching food products to cook disgusted me. I had enjoyed my meal until I saw him do that; by that time, I had already slurped up the my bowl of ramen. I didn't think it was that hot as I was the only guest and no one was cooking until I placed myarrived. And now that I'm thinking about it, I don't think my waitress wash her hands before touching the frozen dumplings after taking my order & putting the menu away. I didn't see either one wash their hands during the entire time I was there. [Ordered]Spicy miso ramen (thick noodles) + added spicy rayu sauce ($1.50)Pork gyoza (pan fried dumplings)I smeared some of the spicy rayu sauce on my dumplings and then dipped it into the dumpling sauce= yummyyyMy favorite ramen is always thick noodles. The ramen had rich creamy broth, custard like soft boiled egg, soft tender pork chasui and garnished with bean sprouts (was soggy/limp) and a mountain of scallions. Mix in tha spicy rayu for that extra kick, mMmmm yum  I really enjoy the food but I'm questioning the cleanliness and hygenie of the staff there.4 stars because of staff and how nice they areIf it was just the food, it would be 3 starsI got the Spicy Paitan and it wasn't really impressive. The broth was okay and not really that rich in flavor. The noodles were a nice texture but soaked in the flavor of the soup so it was okay. The best thing in the bowl was probably the spicy oil which they did a good job with and the cha siu.This place has a pretty noodle broth, we ordered two boiled ramen. It came with char siu (two small pieces) wish they were bigger! Also some corn and bean spouts! Wish they gave more noodles too! It's pretty small portion for the price. I believe it was about $ 13.50 each bowl. Overall, the noods  were tasty and the broth was hearty! Would love some more topping in the future like seaweed or bamboo or even woodear slices, it would add a good crunch to the meal!.This is a decent place that's near my house, we ordered delivery and I had the ramen (black garlic) and sho yu ramen (a bit too salty), the side items like corn and slice beef is good! The broth is yummy but a bit too salty for me. The price is decent a little cheaper than manhattan ramen prices. Next time I wanna try the takoyaki and fries which looks delicious In pics posted by other you tubers..Was craving ramen and found this place on Yelp. Ordered a black garlic ramen, a seafood ramen and their okonomiyaki fries for takeout. Waited 10mins max for the order.The ramen broth was not the best, as it was watery but their thin noodles were good (tasted better than the thick ones). Would definitely order again from their shoyu ramen section, not the shio section.Their okonomikyaki fries is a MUST!!! Even though they got a but soggy by the time I ate it, the sauce and the runny egg combination was perfection! Overall a good place and would order from them again!.Great local ramen restaurant for the neighborhood  (there are sparse choices honestly spread throughout Brooklyn). I got the Golden Ratio Ramen. Gf had the Shoyu Paitan. We enjoyed b ou th very much and will be returning when we have a Ramen craving..Conveniently located off the 18th Avenue N subway station. A good ramen restaurant for the neighborhood but I had better. Restaurant is currently serving take out orders and deliveries only during the COVID situation..I loved this Ramen spot, all because I loved E Honda as a kid playing street fighter!! The decor was great the food was fresh. There's an open kitchen concept with bar seating and they have some seating in the back. IIf you want a traditional soda spite coke you aren't in luck they only have Asian soda on the scene. I order the fries it wasn't my cup of because I am not a fan of barbecue sauce on food or undercooked eggs. I ordered the Golden Ratio. The soup was phenomenal!!!! The corn in it gave it great crunch, the noodles had bite and were very firm. The pork and the broth made this dish! Simply  amazing.Don't delay you must go today!.I came in around 8:45PM on a Tuesday with 3 friends. We were greeted politely and seated quickly. The seats are bar style and you are sitting in front of the chef. There are small tables in the back if you choose to sit there. Any anime lover will quickly love the atmosphere of the restaurant. Posters of One Piece and Dragon Ball are on the wall. I ordered the miso ramen and the okonomiyaki fries. I do not frequently eat ramen, but to me the ramen was tasty. The char siu was the best part of the ramen. It almost melted in my mouth and had a meaty taste without being too heavy. The noodles were firm and the broth had a good flavor. It also came with a lot of corn which I love. The okonomiyaki fries are waffle fries with mayo and sauce that tasted like the takoyaki sauce. It also came with an egg. It was good but didn't stand out to me.Overall I had a enjoyable experience and I would come again. The only comment I have is that they have no beer.Thank you Umai Ramen!.Sitting in bar while serving ramen while the chef cooks in front of you. but other ramen restaurant don't have a sitting bar..Umai Ramen you are absolutely amazing, I had a spectacular experience here yesterday. The atmosphere, the service, the menu. Black Garlic Ramen just tasty. I do not have any complaints. Service is marvelous. Umai Ramen... Thanks and keep up the good work."
"I love this place! I spend many a happy morning here on my weekday days off from work.I bring my book, get a crepe and a coffee and I'm well away.The people who work here are always lovely and friendly, and the food is consistently good. I usually get the sunny side up crepe - a crepe with bacon, mushrooms, cheese and a sunny side up egg, but they also have a plethora of other crepes, both savoury and sweet as well as various other food and drinks. I keep meaning to try the sweet potato pie, but the crepes draw me in every time..I was going to say, it's a pity they're closing this Sunday!But actually I don't think I'd come back here even if they weren't closing. The service is great, it's a family business, and everyone is super friendly. There's a gender neutral restroom and plenty of seating. They use real flatware and crockery. There's free WiFi and its a nice place to hang out. But the espresso coffee is dreadful, and the vegetarian quiche was inedible. Not just under heated but actually undercooked, with crunchy still raw onion. I don't know, maybe the crepes and other menu items are good?.This was defiantly worth the walk in the ! We normally go to Tahoe in the winter snowboarding and have crepes on the mountain, so decided to do it here!  Super cute and quaint place, and the best crepes.It's probably seamless. That's what most restaurants who use the delivery app's service claim when things go awry with delivery. But missing items and lukewarm food, delivered on time make me regret ordering delivery. And wondering why there's an additional delivery fee if your in-house service is so lackluster. Disclaimer - it's an issue of mine. I expect that you are charging me a delivery fee (for in-house service) that the packaging, quality of food, something (!) is above and beyond. But it wasn't. Based on other reviews, I'm sure its a better dine-in experience..Went for breakfast. Terrible food & awful coffee. Had an egg/gruyere crepe, absolutely no flavor what so ever. None!!! Why would you serve food with no flavor at all. Not even salt/pepper added or on the table. I'd rather eat nothing. Waste of food and calories. My sister ordered the egg/bacon crepe. It was made with cheap bacon with smoke flavor added. Yuck! Our plates were full when we were done & we were not satiated at all. And the coffee tasted like coffee you would expect at a road side gas station in the mid-west. Not really sure how you make coffee that tastes that bad??? My latte was the coffee with warm milk added, not espresso with frothy milk. Certainly not the quality I expect in any eating establishment in this neighborhood. Good concept, atrocious execution..I ordered a crepe, they took over half an hour and made it as a f*kng sandwich. Too tired and hungry to argue. Total letdown :( :( :(.Homey, charming cafe & creperie. Hasn't been around for very long, and replaced a former business that also did crepes. This place has a much wider menu and includes pies and other desserts. I originally popped in to get a crepe to go, but ended up staying and eating there because it was so chill and relaxed. The people who work here are friendly and hospitable.I ordered the Trippy Chipotle Chicken crepe, which has chicken, mushrooms, spinach, cheddar cheese, and chipotle mayo. It was yummy! The crepe was slightly sweet and the ingredients were fresh and evenly distributed in the crepe. Also, the crepe was really big. I ate half and was completely full. Ended up taking the rest to go. Made for good leftovers. Also got a mini cherry pie for later. It was very good, had cream cheese in it too. Would definitely come back, especially to sit in the garden area now that the weather is nice..We visited NYC on my birthday. After we arrived in the city, we yelped where to eat breakfast and found this one. Interior is very cute and cozy. We had savory crepe and coffee. I was surprised how tasty the crepe was. The owner is very nice and she recommended the Brooklyn bridge park, and we chatted about Brooklyn. I really liked this intimate style of nice talking at the cafe..Yesterday my niece Ebony and her fiancee, Stephen got married at ""Take A Break and I'll Bake Cafe."" The establishment is beautiful. The outdoor garden space was used for the ceremony and celebration. It was lovely. The owners Faith and Louis were two of the nicest people that had the pleasure of meeting in a long time. Accommodating, courteous, professional and warm. They made it a priority that our event was successful. And for that we were very appreciative. The food and beverages provided for the event were freshly prepared right before being served.  And may I say very, very delicious! To top it off, Faith baked the most beautifully decorated, delicious cake ever. The owners and the staff worked with me every step of the way to insure that everything ran seamlessly. Thank you Take A Break Cafe!.whoooooooo!!!!!and... whoooooo!!!!!!the pic says it all!!!  #amazeballs. can't wait to come.back!!.Cute family owned southern style cafe with outdoor space in back. Great customer service and a nice selection of sweet and savory options and reasonable prices. Perfect for brunch with friends."

"When I walked up there were two people making out as hard as you could imagine. I mean they were really going at it. For a long time. At first I was like, damn, did someone just come back from war?  Because that's pretty much the only answer for this kind PDA. Either that or drugs. War or drugs. It was that intense and it was definitely something I was going to tell people about later.Then, after our meal I forgot all about it. Thats how great this place is, from the food, to the people to the price. And that's how I would describe this place: It's better than watching a return from war, drug induced, public make out session..""Oh, so there was bread,"" I murmured to no one in particular, as the Chef de cuisine and I stood awkwardly next to the gaping archway to the kitchen, watching a sous chef cut up some delicious looking* olive bread, while I was waiting for the restroom after dinner. Chef replies ""I bet you're looking forward to some of that!"" I think: Be nice, Claire F. I say: ""I really enjoyed the gnocchi"" and give him a big smile. How can you not smile at that sweet, chubby face of his? You just want to like him. Much like how I really wanted to give this place five stars. But I just couldn't. And here's why:When my friend made the res, it was going to be two of us, then another girlfriend wanted to join. We called and were told that there was no room at the inn. Upon arrival, the two of us are seated at a 4-top. -1. Literally.We weren't brought a cocktail list but were asked if we wanted one, yet when we received said list it was completely devoid of anything interesting. It contained the likes of a hot chocolate-Bailey's ""cocktail""... for pre-dinner? The wine list, however, was pretty good and offered a range of price points. I liked my pinot noir and my companion her prosecco. The ""bouncer"" that has been mentioned below... is he the manager/maitre d'hotel? For such a small place, he does have a noticeable commanding presence that could perhaps be distracting. Yet their swish logo/menu design and the adorable Christmas decor made it a pleasant atmosphere, even despite unforeseeable intangibles, like when our superstar waitress had to swoop in to move some doofus' bike that he had thought to bring INTO the restaurant** and lean against our table. But, the music? I felt like I was in a Greek taverna, dining with Yanni.*** Also, that is a super ugly HUGE painting next to the bar, completely at odds with the rest of the decor.Our server was stellar. She was friendly, helpful and completely attentive, without being overbearing. When we had a question about a menu item she chose to go ask the kitchen rather than BS us.Overall, the food was great. The butternut squash soup was really well done, with fried sage and creme fraiche really bringing out the flavour. I had the ricotta gnocchi that was simply dreamy in its pillow-like texture with braised beef, greens and sage/balsamic brown butter. I savored each bite. Feeling yuletide-y, we opted for the figgy pudding for dessert-- it was paired with a five spice creme anglaise that just. worked. There was a mini spoon battle for that last bite, for sure. You may have won this round, Addie S., but I'll be back! (shakes fist)And I will. I think this place has potential for greatness. I'll give them a few more months to work out the kinks in their service and visit again. (3.75)---* I can neither confirm nor deny its deliciousness as my table was never brought any.** for realzies*** In a word: bizarre. In another few: that actually sounds like fun....Brooklyn has been waiting a long time for a restaurant of this caliber to spring in the County of Kings, Cobble Hill. That day has arrived. The concept is now not original: locally sourced, seasonal, ultra fresh ingredients with a relatively short menu that frequently changes. But the bar has been raised to a new level of excellence. First and foremost, the food. Wonderful, as in inspiring wonder (in a good way). My hangar steak with truffeled potatoes and horseradish sauce was perfect, and cooked exactly medium rare as ordered. My first wife's hen was exceptional, with a succotash that changed my life.  Enough to quote Deee Lite: My supper dish, my succotash wish.  I'll be thinking about and longing for that succotash likely until my next visit. It was only the beginning of their second week in business, and a holiday night, but at 8:30pm, the restaurant was full and there was a short wait, which could be spent at the bar, or outside on benches and chairs situated in a picturesque part of Cobble Hill (not that there are many non-picturesque blocks). We chose for the bar, ordered a glass of wine and a cocktail. The wine was remarkable, and they have a fine list of reds/whites and sweet wine by the glass. I had a cocktail that was well executed. We then opted to eat our meal at the bar, which was well tended by Alex. The service was quick, efficient, professional and observant, from the maitre 'd to the gentlemen who brought our meal. Appetizers were first rate: an heirloom tomato salad with feta and watermelon. The sweetness and juiciness of the watermelon nicely complemented the tomatoes, which in turn were complemented by the saltiness of the cheese. Dessert was also lovely. Watermelon, basil, and berry sorbet, and a peach tart with ice cream were a pleasant way to end the meal. Coffee and tea were also exceptional. The restaurant is on the small size, but considering it was full, the noise level is fine. The design has slightly modern vibe while maintaining the warmth of the space and some of the older features (such as the pressed  tin ceiling) which has been a restaurant for the past few decades under other ownership. The chef/owner schmoozed the room to accolades from pleased nabe residents who are likely quite happy to have him as an addition to the local food scene. This is exceptional food. The prices are also a bit exceptional, and some patrons, used to ""value sized"" portions might view the plates on the small side. However, we left feeling satisfied and not overfed. I thought I was burnt out on ""new American"", but Breuckelen has restored my faith in the power of food to inspire..What a wonderful place!  Small, but cozy and the staff are awesome and make you feel like you are eating in their own home.  Everyone from Andrew the executive chef/owner to Jeff the maitre d and Alexander the bartender.  All were so welcoming and a pleasure to converse with.It's located in a historic building including original artifacts on the wall from the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge.  We sat at the bar as we popped in without a reservation on a busy Saturday night.  I don't have a problem eating at the bar in general and sometimes prefer it, but if that's not for you make sure you call and make a res.  My cousin and I shared a couple of salads to start off.  We attacked the roasted beet salad first.  What a beautiful presentation.  Great combo of cheese and nuts, combine that with the fresh lettuce and juicy beets in a blood orange vinaigarette.  Perfect!  Then moved on to the prosciutto salad which was just as succulent.  A little on the acidity side, but tasted so healthy and fresh.  After the salads they brought out an amuse-bouche which I forget what it was, but a classy touch.  I know it had cilantro in it.  Might have been a mussel???For an entree I ordered the 5 spice duck breast.  While waiting for the entree, Andrew surprised us each with a bowl of risotto.  Wow! Wow! Wow!  I don't usually think to order risotto, but it was one of the best things I've ever had.  Subtle hints of parmesan and truffle oil which pucker up your taste buds.  It was perfect because it was just what I needed being that it was a cold night and warmed me up with every spoonful.  The duck entree was so juicy and tender and presented so nicely.  The port jus was sweet and went great with the chestnut spaetzle.  My cousin had the bouillabaisse and enjoyed immensely.  Don't leave without trying the risotto, make sure you say hello to the wonderful staff and don't be afraid to go out on a limb and order something you might not normally get.  You won't be disappointed.   Almost forgot to mention it is very reasonable for the quality and creativity of the cuisine you are served.  Entrees are between $18-26.  If you went across the river you would easily be paying upwards of $35 for the same plate of food..As far as the other reviewers noting the crowd and close tables- i agree with the person who notes that this is NY. Although its always nice to feel like you have your own private little oasis, unless you are ordering out, you rarely get that (ive never seen it for a decent restaurant at least). The staff were very nice and well educated not only on their food and drink but on Brooklyn as well. It was great having an explanation of the location and the items that were on the walls as decor. (Im not going to repeat anything because i dont want to saying anything incorrectly- but when you go there make sure to look at the decor, and ask what each item is- it was pretty fascinating to me!)I started off with a Breuckelen D'oro- it was phenomenal. And trust me I know my drinks. I am a mixologist as well as an avid drinker ;) When we were served our sparkling water i was pleased to see that they have their own water bottles- nice touch! We had a hard time deciding what to order and our waitress was kind enough to describe each item to us...as well as personal commentary- which i found very helpful. We ended up trying an aray of items, which sadly i can not name them all off as I dont remember what they all were- so, i will describe to you what each item was as i can not leave anything out each item had my friends and I in awe.First we were presented with a small beginner which consisted of a mussle in carrot puree. When I was told what this was, i can not lie, i thought to myself something hideous. However, upon tasting this i was blown away with surprise. It was fabulous. I wanted more, the three of us joked noting we wanted to lick the spoons they were served on. We then had what i think was a gazpacho (im embarassed that im forgetting each items real name). It was amazing and i just adored the presentation (in a small tea cup). Each flavor melted into the next and eventhough my portion was only big enough for three spoonfuls (this was a gift from the chef to try) i felt as though I had a full serving due to the massive amount of flavor. Then it was on to our main courses, I had the Crawfish Risotto- I did, however, have the chef make this sans mushrooms for me (i cant live with fungus on my plate!). Its creamy texture and perfect amount of those delightful little critters was so satisfying! As expected it was very rich and i found myself sharing with my friends0 who gladly devoured it with me. My guests enjoyed the hanger steak and all i heard was ""oh my"" and ""wow"" and it was gone from both plates before i could ask how to spell ""hangar"".For desert we were presented with a tasting of the torte, the fresh made ice creams, and what i think was a chocolate bomb. (Again, please forgive my memory here!) The ice creams were prefect in every way. Lime Basil was not my choice- but i can appreciate the delicate flavor and herb-y after notes. The plum was my favorite (ironically matching my drink) and I still dream about this. The Vanilla was so smooth and creamy that i can never experience haagen das again without wondering where they are getting their recipe from and why they havent improved it.All in all this restaurant is now my favorite. I can not wait to go back and Its my lifes goal to make sure anyone who appreciates fine dining experience this location. I even made reservations for my doctor this week..I just LOVE this place.I had the tomato and watermelon salad as my appetizer and it was fantastic. I had to eat the ricotta gnocchi slowly because it was so damn good I didn't want to eat to disappear just yet LOL. The vibe is pretty great too!The only negative was that the service was bit slow - understandable since it was their opening week..Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip. what's that sound? That, my friends, is a High Class Rip Off.1. Short Ribs are on the menu for $26. They come with polenta, wilted greens and some other stuff. The only thing that had real flavor was the polenta. So sad. The short ribs were chewy and tasteless.2. The amuse bouche, a spoon with an overcooked mussel and cut chives,  came after we received our entrees. The waiter said that it had been sent to another table by mistake. I wish he hadn't said that, because it looked as though it had been sitting at another person's table. I hesitated while my husband went for it. The look on his face quickly let me know not to give it a try.3. The 'Bklyn' drink is basically a Manhattan, but with a 'real' maraschino cherry that tastes eerily similar to a nasty grape.4. Bartender was nice, and I get that he wants his drinks to be more authentic...but it seems that happens at the expense of taste.5. Let's get to the aforementioned short ribs for $26. Funny. They show up on the bill for $28. When asked, the bartender apologized and said it must have been a mistake and would we like a drink on the house. I appreciate that it was offered, but as my husband said, no, I'd rather have my 2$ that you purposely overcharged us. When you have a computerized menu system, how often do prices really go in wrong? I think that the clientele is so wealthy that restaurant-goers don't check the cheque. They should. Owner is ripping customers off.So close to home, but sadly we won't be returning..We had a great meal here; start to finish. Came by on a busy Saturday night without a reservation and sat at the bar. Every dish that we had delicious. For real.The amuse bouche with the mussels: Delcious.Salad with sardines: Delicious.Cauliflower soup: I licked the plate.Fried quail over a bed of grits: Delicious.The duck: tender and flavorful. Perfect.Sweet potato tart type thing: Delcious.In regards to the rest of the hood, Breuckelen is more casual than Grocery or Saul but I think the food is on the same level.We'll be back.(Update: They have stopped taking reservations. We can all debate if this is a good/bad thing, but the issue is that of course their bar is smallish and there isn't much space and the closest bar will be three blocks away.).This has been my 5th trip to Breuckelen since their opening in Sept/Oct and I think it just may be my last.  Visit #4 was over Sunday brunch, which left little to the imagination and a $60 tab for 2.  They know the're eggs right?  My last visit, Jan 7th 2011, was just ok.  I was excited to start with the sardines, only to be disappointed as they were over grilled, dry and complicated. (The paired the sardines with garbonzo beans and red peppers that were just out of place and didn't belong with the dish.)I followed my app with their Red Snapper dish, which they replaced with Grouper as they ran out of snapper. This was by far the best dish I ever had at Breukelen.  If I was to go back, I would order this dish again.My partner had some lack-luster Lobster squash bisque, but his short rib entree was terrific.  So here is my recent problem... There was the overpriced, bland brunch, but now they had 2 bad appetizers and on top of it, stopped taking American Express!   There reason was because it was too costly, but at an average ""entree"" priced at $29 they should cough up the fee.  Our bill for 2, including a $80 bottle of wine came to $214.00 after tip.  I think they can afford to pay the AMEX fee.  To top it off - when I was asked about my experience, and I commented on American Express, the manager immediately acknowledged my sentiment stating that I was the 3rd person of the night to say the same thing.  When she walked over to tell the Chef and Proprietor, Andrew, he looked at the manager and shrugged his shoulders saying, ""I don't care... I am not paying Amex the fee.""  His arrogance was enough for me to not go there again.  Andrew is so short sighted and bottom line, a bad business man - not just for the Amex decision, but because he is inconsistent in his delivery..- The squash soup was AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE better than any squash soup I'd ever had in my life. This is NOT HYPERBOLE.- My fish was cooked perfectly.- There's this French chardonnay blend they have there by the glass. Don't mess around. Get a bottle.- Our bartender made us an herb-infused cocktail of his own design after dinner and, Sweet Baby Jesus, it was amazing. - During after-dinner cocktails, the table next to us had their pasta arrive and just smelling it felt like a second meal. Totally sublime.- Do it."
"Thank you to Joseph, Tula, and Cynthia!! it was a cold night and there wasn't any hot chocolate left but Joseph hooked us up with white hot chocolate and even helped us with another different drink and was super helpful. Both Tula and Cynthia were super friendly and nice and im mostly writing this because it's fifth ave in NY and these three employees not only held it down but were super nice and helpful. they definitely deserve some recognition :).Friendly & polite staff but they are just way too slow. There was about 4 people behind the counter in the area to make the drinks, but they were moving at a snail pace.The young lady who made my drink the last time I went, had my cup in her hand, but was talking to another employee who I believe was telling her something along the lines of what people should be doing, however that pausing & not multitasking  (talking & making my drink) was slowing me down as well..The young lady that waited on me was so nice here.I was in a ""head spinny"" not focused chatty mood, and she walked me through how to use my points on my app for a free bakery item...offered to heat it up for me, and delivered it to me.Some modest seating available here as Covid continues to lift. Just a positive experience overall, and centrally located near the Palace hotel and short walk to Roc Center..This barista was so mean. Her name is ROSE. I was just asking for my drink coz I've been standing there for almost 20 minutes and all of the people behind at the line got there drink. She didn't even ask me nice if what do I need or what I'm asking she literally interrupted me asking the other barista about my drink and said . WAIT WERE MAKING UR DRINK. But end up they lost the sticker of my drink..This is literally the epitome of a hot mess. I understand the location being busy because of where it is in midtown. But in my opinion that means it should have a pretty damn good manager running it and the staff should be pretty damn good. Every time I come in here there's an issue with my order whether I'm the only person in there or I order ahead like today. I realize that on Saturday it's GONNA be pretty busy I ordered my drink at 3:12 the app told me it would be ready around 3:19 I didn't step foot inside the location until 3:27... I go to the counter and there's no drink. Now whether there wasn't a drink made for me as of yet or if somebody took my drink, who can say. Now what I see while the young man is remaking my drink is a person who seems to be the manager, she's wearing fedora hat and  no name tag making drinks for people not wearing gloves? Which OK I understand they are not necessary for everything, but if I see you take your finger off a cup and it's covered in whipped cream that you're than serving to that customer in the middle of a pandemic... !!! (It's a no for me dawg) Not really taking precautions to the best of their abilities and not having a sense of urgency, the staff seems more suited for retail than food service.This is probably a culmination of having crappy service here repeatedly but honestly if this is one of the busiest locations in the city it's staff should be a reflection of that..I ordered using the app. I am extremely sensitive to caffeine. It makes me nauseous and gives me bad headaches therefore I always ask for decaf. They did not use decaf and I am very ill as I write this. It's better to order at the counter. I haven't encountered the issue before when I have done so..I visited this location and met Jay, Janice and  store manager Chris. They all made me feel welcomed at this location and provided great customer service. I will definitely come back to this location. I would highly recommend visiting this location when your in the area.Lorraine.Starbucks is Starbucks, but the MORNING staff here is very friendly. They remember peoples names even though they're always busy. I'd recommend doing a mobile order at this location as their in person line moves super slow. Not sure why it's such an issue to blend the matcha powder and milk and then pour it over ice, but it always is for the girls who work here in the afternoon. No, I don't want a Frappuccino, I want a matcha latte without clumps of matcha powder so either shake it well or blend it, but don't give me an attitude when I get a cup of milk with green specks slowly floating to the bottom. That's not a matcha latte..Starbucks is Starbucks, but the staff here is very friendly. They remember peoples names even though they're always busy. I'd recommend doing a mobile order at this location as their in person line moves super slow..Even though this location is very busy, the staff is attentive and tries their very best to get you your order in a fast manner. I love coming to this location when I need my afternoon pick me up..""Girl.... I know I got customers lining up but I just need to talk to you about my trifling ass man and other shit"" type of mood here."
Amazing shrimp lo mein! I've been coming here for over 20 years and the food is scrumptious every single time..Great take-out food. And they make a delicious raspberry iced tea that is awesome. Unfortunately they do not deliver but pick up only. Doesn't stop me from getting some excellent food and doesn't break the wallet..Long time customer here and I must say the place has a great atmosphere and very nice service.  Workers are very friendly and the food is great (especially the shrimp rolls which are peeled very well).  Continue the great service!.I've been eating Chinese food here for over 25 years. This is one of the longest standing small businesses in the area. The family that's runs it is so sweet and the food is effortlessly good..the man is always picking his nose or sneezing. they don't even use gloves. the place always looks pretty vacant because i don't think they are sanitary. everything looks like it's been there for weeks. the only reason i gave them three stars is because i LOVEEE THEIR SHRIMP ROLLS. but then again i love everyone's shrimp rolls so...
"Went on a Friday night with a few people and had a blast.Pros:* Plenty of selection of games* Plenty of selection of drinks* Bartenders very chill and doesn't take long to get served at all* ATM and multiple coin dispensers* Was crowded but could still play all the games if you waited a little* Chill vibe the entire time, nobody was aggressive except the guy working there reminding you to keep your drinks off the gamesCons:* It was crowded but it was Friday night* Machines don't take quarters, you have to use their tokens so bring cash so you don't have to eat the ATM fee.Average games. Expensive beers at $8 $9 Great location next to st marks when you need to wait for food.Awesome place to revisit your inner child. Beer, cocktails, and old-school arcades are a perfect mix for fun in the East Village. I will admit that this location is a bit smaller and has fewer arcades than the other Barcades in the city. The place has a pretty chill, relaxed vibe which is perfect for the East Village, and most of the games are about 1-2 tokens. Also, if you want to raid your quarters that have been set aside for laundry, the arcades take both tokens and regular quarters. During our visit, we did not have a chance to try the food; however, I was very please with the wide variety of beers and cocktails. I think that I counted at least 25 different beers, so definitely come to Barcade thirsty. We came around 5 pm on a Sunday, and the place was pretty quiet, but it started to pick up around 6:30 pm.I definitely hope to return in the near future..This is the second Barcade I have ever been to - the other one being the location on west 24th Street. This one is considerably smaller and is fairly narrow. Being in the East Village, it can also get fairly crowded on a Friday and Saturday night.However, overall it is still a good place to hang out. And despite having less machines, they have some games I did not see at the other location. Simpsons the Arcade Game, Splatterhouse, Jambo! Safari and Dynamite Cop are some of the ones that come to mind. Good selection of beers and decent quality bar food too..In the area & figured why not come in here & kill some time. Drinks had some Beer & white wine not bad. The space is not very big so with all the games & bar area it's a bit cramped inside. What can u really say about this place? Not much more , old school type arcade games some are good, most are bad. Fun to drink & play games of course but wouldn't really last too long here since the games are ahhh.  Decent music playing, drinks they do have a full bar good enough to kill about an hour or so can't say I would be here too much longer..Mixed feelings about Barcade. It's in my regular rotation and I missed it dearly during COVID -- but in the same breath, it's over crowded, overpriced, and the bartenders are usually assholes.The best time to come is in the afternoon, early -- maybe right at 5pm. There is no point in coming if you see a sea of heads once you walk down the ramp. (Even if you're looking to just use the restroom, the lines will be crazy long anyway.)This place is also kind of dirty all the time...lmao. Keep in mind, unlike the other Barcade, this one doesn't have it's liquor license. But the beer selection is updated a decent amount. The menus are easy to read and you can always find some high percentage pints.The games are great, of course. They're a decent amount, but in my 4/5 years of going here, there hasn't been any new additions. While the other location has had new games come in here and there.I get that it's small but hmmm...It's fun, it's a good gimmick. Who doesn't love a bar where you can do something besides take shots and talk?.Place: This place is so fun! I love barcades!! Service:The service is great! There are machines where you can change you money into tokens and play the games. Usually each game is about 25 cent token or up to 4 tokensFood/price:I am not sure about the food but the drinks are around $8-9. I had a cider beer and it was $8 and they filled it up to the top top lol. Audience:Great for friends! WHOO Recommend/tips?I highly recommend this place. I went at 7:00 PM and honestly perfect time because it was pretty quiet so MORE GAMES TO PLAY..The people who work here and very rude and aggressively manhandled my friend. Will not be receiving our business anymore.I would leave zero stars if I could. Never going here again. Staff is very unprofessional. Food and drink are subpar at best. They are discriminatory to the LGBT community. A few LGBT friends were being harassed by bigots and stood up for themselves and staff sided with the bigots. After that it seemed like they were looking for a reason to kick them out while the harasser got to carry on with their evening even though they caused the whole problem. Ended up kicking them out for absolutely no reason and cussing them out as they left, using disgusting slurs among other words. Owners should be embarrassed..If you want to be called a slur, go here!!! The bouncer was in the bathroom line and tried to sell my friend ""hemp"" and then called my friend a ""dumb b*tch"" when she said no! The bouncers and bartenders kept harassing my friends for being ""too gay"" and asked my friend to ""quit f*gging up the place"". I called them homophobic and they made up some lame excuse to kick us out. As I was leaving they told me to ""get the f*ck outta here you d*ke!!""Is fluency in slurs a job requirement here?"
"Very cute italian restaurant. Lots of cute, old fashioned decorations that give off an authentic vibe. Came in without reservations on a Monday night before the dinner rush. It tended to get busy after we got settled and put in our order.Ordered the farro salad to start. The funky goat cheese was a perfect foil to the sweetness of the roasted squash. Great way to start the meal. The tagliatelle met our expectations. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. Not sure what we were thinking when we ordered the hake filet. The fish just wasn't to our liking - felt a little too salty. The vegetables felt a little blah, like they were roasted in olive oil and nothing tremendously special about them. Not a bad dish. Not a great dish. If we were to come back we'd order the farro salad and the tagliatelle again. Would be interested in the other pasta offerings as well..Loved Al Di La. Highly recommend you come with a group if you can (we came in a group of 6) and do family style so you can try more of their pastas which are all pretty great. We got 7 pastas, 2 antipastis, 1 side vegi, and 3 desserts and walked out very satisfied. For the pastas, we tried the Casunziei (beet ricotta ravioli with butter, poppyseed), Malfatti (Swiss chard ricotta gnocchi with brown butter, sage), Tortelli di zucca (squash/mascarpone ravioli with parm), paccheri(2 orders, large pasta rounds with pork shoulder ragu and creamy goat cheese), tagliatelle (pork/beef/veal ragu), spaghetti a la chitarra neri (basically black squid ink seafood pasta). My personal favorites were the tortellini di zucca (reminded me of an amazing pasta I had at don Angie - slightly sweet bc of the roasted squash I think - delish), and the Paccheri (the noodle texture was so perfectly Al dente / chewy, and can't go wrong with creamy goat cheese). Others loved the spaghetti, but I personally felt it was less unique and a little more salty than I preferred (it also is not very spicy despite note on menu).  Could probably skip the Casunziel - unique and pretty to look at but not my favorite to eat. The Malfatti too was fun - very green given Swiss chard, but probably didn't need more than one which is why family style was perfect. The antipastis were both phenomenal. The farro salad is a must try. Not a salad in my mind ha but delish! The toasty hazelnuts and brown butter vinaigrette were such a great touch and also goat cheese in this one - we are a fan of goat cheese if you can't tell. The creamy oxtail cuttlefish polenta also in same must try category unless you don't like polenta. Honestly even if you don't like it, try a bite bc it might change your mind it's that magical. The side we got was braised carrots with yogurt. Fine but skippable especially if you're choosing between sides vs antipasti.Finally dessert. First I've seen of explicitly decaf coffee in the affogato and very happy about that on a dinner menu. It's also one of the best I've had. Seriously. Whatever that crunchy stuff was in there - basically crack in dessert form.  Panna cotta was delightful too / not too sweet and the almond biscotti or cookie that went with it was a great complement. The pear chocolate tart was crisp on the sides and chewy on the middle. Amazing with the cream. Each of the desserts was a favorite of someone at the table so you can't go wrong with any. Also worth highlighting the smoky mescal cocktail. Folks at our table doubled up on it. Very tasty..For all the years I have walked past this restaurant I have completely missed out on this quaint yet full flavored gem.  One of the best Italian restaurants I have been to in a very long time, no wonder they are always fully booked.  My friend raved about this place and I was extremely pleased and fulfilled.  For an appetizer we had the wild winter salad and mussels drenched with a white wine based sauce with fresh basil and freshly baked bread saturated in the delicious base.  We also tried the filleted hake in a bubbling sauce and fingerling potatoes and ravioli stuffed with ricotta in a red tomato gravy.  Pure deliciousness!!!! I tried a semi sweet red wine sorry can't remember the name.  The appetizer and main dishes were so amazing that we had to have the pear and chocolate cake with vanilla whip and the crème fraiche panna cotta.Have been here a few times and it does not disappoint! It's very well priced, good range and really great classic options. Would bring a date here, or parents when in town! Service is also always really friendly..Soup was chock full of bugs. It was not one or two bugs it was hundreds. Black ants, little beetle type things. It was in their summer seasonal soup.Avoid this place. Have been crying and vomiting in my bathroom for the past half an hour. I am traumatized..Before moving to the neighborhood, my impression of Park Slope was basically brownstones, Prospect Park, and Al Di La. As a college student, I once schlepped all the way here with my then boyfriend and his family just to go to this restaurant. So as you can imagine, I was exultant to return here and had pretty high hopes. I won't say that my hopes were dashed because the food is still very, very good, but the service has been severely downgraded since the pandemic.They are now doing contactless service, which for us meant that there was only one server working the entire restaurant when we went for lunch. It was a frustrating experience for both us and I felt bad for the poor woman who had to juggle everything on her own. We came at lunch on a Friday, and it was fairly empty. We scanned the QR code to see the menu and were able to put in our order on our own phones (payment, tip and all). Just as we arrived and sat outside, another party of two also sat down right after us. About 15 minutes later, I noticed that they got served their water and coffee before we'd even gotten our water, and this was in 80 degree heat! I was pretty annoyed. What made it an even weirder experience was that I had already tipped (and there's no way to retract/reduce that). All that said, I did feel awful for the server - she needed more help.Food came out in take out boxes which was also weird. They either assume you'll have leftovers or ran out of dishware?Polenta is still fantastic..One of the best and famous Italian restaurants in Park Slope. Hard to try anything else on the menu than the Saltimbocca Alla Romana... I have tried other dishes but really hard to beat this one due to all the different flavors. Love the desserts as well and great wine selection. Service is always great. A must try !.Ended up having brunch at Al Di La Trattoria on Sunday morning. I was not impressed by the actual breakfast items, but dishes I would expect on the dinner menu as well as the drinks were solid.Quality: Our brunch at Al Di La Trattoria started with their excellent Sgroppino drink. A combination of prosecco, vodka, and lemon sorbet. An ideal brunch beverage for a warm day. Unfortunately, the food was not quite on the same level. I started with the Frittata, which is an absolute skip item. It frankly should not even be on the menu. It seemed like something that was baked and then left to sit, refrigerated, and then brought back out. The Egg Sandwich, was better, but still not great. Two over easy eggs on a potato bun with fontina, spicy mayo, and bacon. The weak point on this dish was the roll, which was not as fresh and soft as you would hope. The saving grave of the meal was the Funghi And Polenta, a last minute addition to our order, but the best item we had. A mix of mushrooms, greens, and egg over an excellent polenta. It was delicious. The only thing missing was a bit of hot sauce.Quantity: The true breakfast items were on the smaller side, but the Funghi And Polenta was very filling.Value: $10 for a Sgroppino. $6 for the Frittata. $6.50 for the Egg Sandwich. $18.50 for the Funghi And Polenta. Ambiance: Al Di La Trattoria is located in Park Slope, along 5th Avenue. Not sure if the inside is open for dinner, but they had it closed off during brunch. Instead there were a row of tables along the side of the building and a small covered structure sitting in the street. The road and sidewalk are slanted, so you should expect a back and forth battle with both tables and chairs. A quick peak inside showed a rustic and romantic dining room headlined by a chandelier in the center of the room. It looks like a nice place for a date night once fully reopened.Crowd: On a near perfect Sunday morning, almost every restaurant was packed. This was one of the quieter locations along 5th and we were able to grab a table easily.Service: They have it set up so there is almost no interactions with staff. Guests seat themselves then order and pay with a QR code. Staff merely instructs guests of this information and brings out food and drinks.Parking: Some street parking in the nearby residential area..Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, hearty food. Just need more choices for the dessert menu, according to season..Park Slope, similar in many ways to The Upper West Side, has never been a food destination. Back in the 90s that seemed to change as 5th Ave gentrified and a new wave of bars and restaurants rolled in. Hard to believe but for a few minutes, back then, the place was even ""hip"" and was on the verge. Well, of course all that has changed, hypergentrification is the New Normal and with it has came all the faux, trendy, crowdsourced and hipster garbage you'd expect, all at sky high prices and with zero hospitality. We were amazed to find, after a 10 year Slope hiatus, that Al Di La, the place that started it all remains in good form and no longer has the tight crowding and long lines it once did. The salads, apps, homemade pastas, fish, game and beef all superb. Exquisite desserts as well. We had the grilled calamari with beans as an appy, black chittara with octopus pasta, grilled chicken. Gianduja and pear torta for dessert. All terrific. Wines, grüners and sauvignons 8 bucks a glass! All in, dinner for two with apps, wine and dessert at $50/head. A steal for food of this quality.We don't get to the Slope much, mainly just for Bandshell Concerts and Museum visits but when we do we're gonna be sure to hit Al Di La, still Park Slope's best restaurant."
"Pilot kombucha on tap. Selection of the most delicious pastries and tables for two outside. Friendly service. I had the most delicious slice of orange poppyseed bread and walked away smiling..Best egg sandwich in town. The cafe has incredible drinks (alcoholic and otherwise) and great service, too! Everyone I've interacted with who works here has been so friendly. One of my favorite drinks has sorbet in it, and I once went and purchased... a tub of sorbet. That's all. Only rated four stars because of price! I wish I could come here everyday..Solid little cafe run by the folks at...well you guessed it, Al Di La. If you haven't been to the main restaurant on the corner (this little cafe sits on Carrol, not on fifth), you're missing out. The dinner there is amazing, and the brunch is solid as well (you could argue the service is quite slow, but the quality of the food more than makes up for it). Anywho, the cafe shares the same kitchen as the restaurant and aa such the limited hot food they serve is awesome. It has been a WHILE since I was ""wowed' by an egg sandwich, but the one here was friggin' amazing (and not terrible at 6.50$). The Americano I had was also very very good, as was the drip coffee my fiancee had (so I'm told). Bonus, drip coffee refills are only a buck each, so there is that. This is a super laid back spot where you could easily get some work done and be well fed in the process; stop by on a lazy Sunday morning to see the Park Slope locals lounging about (I'll be at the last table on the left).If you are looking for a nice, quiet spot to drink a cuppa with a delicious egg sandwich or pastry? Al Di La cafe is definitely the place to visit! Around the corner from Al Di La Trattoria, you will find a small cafe with a few outside tables. Once inside, you are greeted with a smile by the friendly staff. Grab a cup of drip (refills are only a dollar!) to go with a croissant or brownie (they are super rich and big so please share haha). The egg sandwich is delicious. Fried eggs with runny yolks topped with cheese and a spicy creamy sauce. I can definitely see myself sitting here an hour or two, sipping coffee and reading. I am so glad that we stumbled upon this neighborhood gem..Al di La Cafe is the perfect spot for a casual morning breakfast. The ""heaviest"" item on the menu in the morning is an egg sandwich. I have yet to order one, but they look delicious. I'm a big fan of their pastries and reliable drip coffee. It seems like they also serve dinner with their sister restaurant around the corner but I'm not sure if it's the same menu, seating check-in, etc..So glad there's finally a legitimately rich, dark cold brew in the neighborhood! The folks who work there are incredibly sweet, the pastries are amazing and the breakfast sandwich is a perfect easy meal on a Sunday morning, preferably with a book at one of the nice sunny tables outside. Highly recommend!.So glad there's finally a legitimately rich, dark cold brew in the neighborhood!

"The Jerk Chicken is delicious. It is also hot. As I ordered, the waiter warned me, ""it's really hot. Are you sure?"" This piqued my curiosity so I affirmed my intention. While I eat a lot of hot food, I'm used to generally restaurants diminishing the Scoville scale so to avoid food being returned.  This was not the case. Also I wasn't going to be that person: the one who says they can eat hot food, and then sends it back.  That guy happens a lot, and in those cases, deal with the pain, or order something else and pay for it. The waiters will warn you. Even for a seasoned veteran of hot food, it will be an enjoyable and nice surprise. Finally, a restaurant gets ""hot,"" I thought. And they were nice enough to warn me. The sauce was tasty, savory, and a hint of sweetness. It was a delightful dish, and I would definitely order it again. The waiters were solicitous and kind, and glad that I could eat what they served.The house wines were good, well respected entry level wines that will please most palates..I feel bad cause the guy was pretty kind to us and was attentive but I should've known to leave when he said he didn't know how to make a whiskey sour. I ended up ordering a margarita against my better judgement and there was a roach frozen into the ice. I ended up taking a few sips from it. I didn't throw up everywhere because I had just gotten my food and hadn't tried it yet (THANK GOD)..We both had some most delicious Huevos Ranchero here.  We were on our way to the cloisters and some 'unexpected transit rerouting' landed us in the area.  We enjoyed every last bite.  Nice little neighborhood spot..Nice little brunch place. Omelets were tasty, portion sizes were just enough without being overwhelming, and prices are hard to beat--$6 for a draft beer is unheard of in manhattan.When the gods invented grilled chicken sandwiches, James's Zanny Chicken Sandwich was exactly what they had in mind. Pesto, sun-dried tomatoes and black olives with melted mozzarella on a grilled ciabatta: Perfection. My guy had the French toast which was equally spectacular. Acoustically, the outdoor seating is significantly quieter than the spots right on 181st. Ok, now go eat..3 stars for decently prepared, fresh food but the bottom line for me is taste. 2 turkey burgers with fries came with not one ounce of seasoning, even the most basic of salt & pepper. To sum it up... YUK and never again!.Had brunch outside in a light drizzle but my lord, our omlettes were steaming hot and delicious! Everyone should experience an omlette from this place. Do it..The music here literally always sucks and it's sooo loud. It's a shame because the food is so good..The Black Bean Burger is everything!!!! Great lunch spot, comfy outdoor seating and good beer selection!.BRUH. Can we talk about their tacos?? I had the pork belly and the minute I bit into them, my eyes rolled to the back of my head in pleasure. These are so friggin delicious it's disrespectful!!! The vibe of the bar seems fun but unfortunately they aren't able to do bar service now (#fckRona). I am excited to go when we can!! Would definitely order again and loved the host (Robert..? Great eyebrows!)!"
"I wish I could share a picture of my ice cream like the others, but it didn't even last a second! Let's start out with the place itself.  The store looks really nice from the furnishings to the decorations hung up on the walls.  It seems like the owners made the store with customer comfort in mind.I wasn't quite sure what to order when I came in, but the lovely person behind the counter (I believe he said his name was Viktor) not only gave me his recommendations but also gave me a bit of information behind the dish.  He highly recommended the Key Lime Pie rolled ice cream and I certainly did not regret following this recommendation.  It was delicious.  I don't think I needed any extra toppings with it.  However, if you do want extra toppings, they seem like they have quite the variety.  I will 100% visit again and I look forward to it.  If you're looking for the TLDR, here it is:  Blossom not only features a pretty site, but also amazing ice cream.  There are alot of toppings available and the faces there are very friendly.  THANK YOU!.Stopped by to get a dessert after dinner. They had a nice list of flavors, vegan too. And a large amount of free toppings that can be added after the ice cream is rolled. We got the sweetheart ice cream (w/ my sweetheart) and several toppings. The ice cream tasted like the description and satisfied our post dinner sweet tooth. I think the assortment of flavors and toppings definitely make you want to come back..Came here for a late night snack after seeing some amazing photos of the rolled ice cream on yelp The ice cream was good  and topping are free which is always a plus There are many flavors to pick from on the menu they even have a few vegan options I ordered the matcha strawberry and my partner ordered cookie dough with a Nutella drizzle-Matcha strawberry was very flavorful especially with the toppings (mochi, mint chocolate chips & gummy bears) - cookie dough on the other hand tasted more like vanilla and the drizzle was just a ball of Nutella in the center They're open till 11pm during Covid which is great Overall, a nice late night option if you're craving rolled ice cream.My friend and I decided to check out Blossom Ice Cream around 8pm on a Tuesday.  We lucked out that we beat a mini crowd so we weren't pressured to pick flavors.  The shop is tiny and seats about 4 people inside and has a few seats outside.  You basically pick a base for the rolled ice cream and then pick toppings at the end.  On this particular night, there was only one person rolling the ice cream so that made it a bit slow but I've been here before and there were two people rolling which speeds up the process.  The rolled ice cream is $7 flat with unlimited toppings!  This time I got the Sweetheart (vanilla, strawberry, graham cracker) and my friend got the Wild Lavender (blueberry, lavender).  I have also tried the Cookie Butter (cookie butter, cinnamon cracker) and Open Sesame (sesame, graham cracker).  Portion size is great and unlimited toppings are AWESOME!  My friend said that the wild lavender has a strong lavender flavor so make sure you like that if you get it.  The Sweetheart was good, but the Cookie Butter and Open Sesame were both a lot creamier.  I don't know if it was the person making it or just the different type of base, but the Sweetheart was more rigid in texture.  If you like creamy ice cream, I would recommend the Cookie Butter.Overall, if you know what you want in advance or you're great at impromptu topping-picking, you can get a delicious and beautiful dessert.  Yes, you can get regular ice cream for cheaper but Blossom Ice Cream is a great place to try rolled ice cream!.Vegan rolled ice cream!!! It was sooooo good!! This is my worst review ever because I forgot the name of the flavor I got but it was vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce, strawberry, and banana. It tastes like a dream and I loved the texture. It was expensive but a good treat.Got delivery to my apartment and loved it! The ice cream was milky sweet rolled ice cream with Corn Flakes, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and a marshmallow. The ice cream was so creamy and still frozen when it arrived. The taro bubble tea tasted the same as any artificial taro bubble tea tastes like, but the lightbulb container was so cute! I washed it and kept it for decoration after..This place is soooo cute!! 100/10 recommended stopping by this place. The workers are so friendly, sweet, and understanding. Their icecream? Amazing. Their souvenir light bulb cups? Beautiful. Their drinks? Splendid. Hotel? Trivago. (They're also ensuring the safety of customers during this rough time by mandating masks!!).So so so yummy - the perfect summer treat! They are super helpful, and have put a lot of precautions into making sure both staff and guests are safe. I ordered the vegan piña colada rolled ice cream with mochi, I highly recommend it!.This is amazing ice cream.The flavors are made right in front of you from natural ingredients so it's really fresh/refreshing.  My favorite so far is wild-berry lavender but, based on what I've tried, everything here is great.  Place is pretty cozy so don't expect a seat and all toppings are included wth the price..As thai ice cream rolls are a huge trend in Manhattan, I can see why it was brought over to Brooklyn. I ordered the key lime pie, and unlike the thai ice cream rolls in the city, the rolls itself weren't that creamy and at all delicious, way too heavy on the lime for my taste... The rolls were pretty hard since they probably didn't have as much milk in their ice-cream base that they roll with.The redeeming part to this ice-cream joint was the unlimited toppings which really made the ice-cream enjoyable. At 10 below in Chinatown, the key lime pie ACTUALLY tastes like key lime pie. Overall shop is small and can only fit a party of 6. Otherwise, pray that it isn't raining outside since they offer a bench or two outside of the shop to accommodate you."
"My buddy is starting to get into wine lately, and the two of us being more beer guys, I actually welcomed a change of just going to bars with beers and bar food.He told me to look up a place on Yelp and Google maps, and hit upon Vesta.My best bud arrived earlier to the place and sat at the bar.I guess my friend's outgoing nature and speaking with the bartenders, who were equally outgoing and friendly, opened up a really great time and overall experience at Vesta.I have no idea what wines were provided to us. I just drank them, but they were all great recommendations by David and Jude.We ordered the meat and cheese board, pesto arancini balls, mussels and ""la torta del piccolo"" for dessert.All of the food was just impeccable, unbelievably delicious. The barkeeps gave us more toasted bread to sop up the broth in the mussels dish. Then I just ate the buttery broth with a spoon. I'll worry about my cholesterol levels on a later point in my future.The service, atmosphere and food made the visit to Vesta feel like an Anthony Bourdain or an upscale Guy Fieri show.I will definitely be back here, and you should go to this place too!.Nice neighborhood spot. Came for brunch and had a great experience.I started with a hot coffee, then my boyfriend and I shared the winter mixed greens and butternut squash salad, warm bankie (loved the polenta), a margherita pizza, and the torta del piccolo bambino gesu cristo dessert (aka the baby Jesus cake). Everything was delicious - but especially that cake! Good service, too. Would return for dinner to try some of the pastas..Amazing food and great service. Excellent and unmatched. The wine was delicious. Recommend the wild boar lasagna, rice ball and meatballs..Service and food is excellent. I highly recommend coming to this neighborhood gem. I'm fortunate enough to live within walking distance. Get the mushroom pasta! It taste like a hug in your stomach (idk if that makes sense but just do yourself a favor and come prepared for a yum meal.).And they played The Rolling Stones all night!!!Skip the wine on tap. Cabernet was too raw. And y need to offer local beer !!!Chilled corn soup was delicious but has something in it that swelled my husband's tongue. Meat and cheese board was just right. Lovely crusty bread with salami and mortadella. Piece of bleu and parmigiana-like. Tubs of berry jam, olives and ricotta. House focaccia with olive oil to start is amazing. Margherita pizza was too thin but flavorful.  More like matzoh pizza or pizzaoh. Service is lovely and friendly. And they don't rush you!!.I just pontificated for days on google. Suffice to say that this place is perfect.  Service and food. Meatballs are To love for. Lasagne was awesome. Home made. Professionally perfect prep and authentic flavors in every direction. Go enjoy. Amazing really..I'm so disappointed given how excited I was to come here! Food: I came for brunch and one thing I like is that they have several Options that feel healthy! I ordered the l'italiamo which is poached eggs, salami, with ricotta on bread. It comes with a side of French fries or gone fries and I got French fries! The ricotta was amazing and made the dish special! I would definitely order that again! My friends ordered the omelet and really enjoyed it!Service: I was very disappointed The service was also way to quick even though no one was waiting! Within 30 minutes they got us our food and cleaned our table, which made me feel rushed! Also my friend asked for a salad as a side as opposed to fries, but they never told her that the omelet comes with a salad and fries! Price: Manhattan prices in Astoria for small portions- didn't think it was worth coming to Astoria for thisAmbience: I sat outside and there was nothing particularly memorableCovid safety: outdoor seating with heat lamps are available! Everyone wears masks,.This establishment is one of my local favorite spots to dine! although it is a little off the beaten path it is worth hoping in a cab for. The inside of the restaurant is so charming it has a quite cozy vibe! It truly is the perfect date night spot.I love the menu of food and wine selection I have never had anything bad on the menu! The pasta are fresh and homemade ,huge plus there is nothing like homemade pasta!  Top recomendations :Short ribs with polenta, Rabbit Ragu, *Must try the meatballs AND Margarita pizza*The pizza does not contain yeast so it doesnt rise like typical pizza crust.. That being said it is a thin crispy crust , great as an app because you wont get too filled up from it .The orecciette with sausage and lasagna is also one of my favorite dishes ..So much to choose from all are great options! The staff are so welcoming and nice they make you feel like your walking into a friends home .They will go above and beyond to make sure you are happy! Thank you cant wait to visit again soon.Even though this part of Astoria hasn't quite gentrified as some would have predicted (#1), I still think Vesta's gamble by investing in this area has paid off. After a decade of being one of the more consistent Italian themed eateries in Astoria, they've made a name for themselves as one of the most recognizable in the borough.Their small'ish setup is nothing short of charming; ideal for dates and smaller groups and they take reservations. The place is minimal but clean and since the pandemic started, they've also pivoted to a solid outdoor setup. While I typically prefer coming here for brunch, their dinner service is probably the better of the two. (#2)I've always appreciated their super simple menu. There is a limited selection of appetizers, pizzas, pastas, some seasonal entrees and veggie sides. Their short rib ragu pappardelle is damn good and quite possibly my favorite dish in the house. I also have high regard for their orecchiette, which has bits of italian pork sausage, swiss chard, with dill and garlic. From the entrees, I'd give the nod to their wild boar lasagna and the pork shank osso bucco. Both are fantastic, even if the portions are a *widdle* on the small side.The brunch is incredibly underrated in my opinion. The avocado toast is beautiful and the carbonara mac and cheese is as tasty as it is indulgent. I have enjoyed their incredibly thin crust hangover pizza, which is essentially breakfast pizza with potato bacon, sausage, and baked eggs over some spicy tomato and provolone. It's an easy dish to share, as is all of their pizzas really.Service is usually pretty good for the most part. I always am impressed with the bartenders for slinging out drinks left and right, considering how extensive their wine collection is. They have also done a very good job with delivery and takeout, which is not an easy during these times. I hope they continue to stick around and look forward to my next meal there.____________(#1) Or for hipster nation, ""hoped?""(#2) If you're smart, go to both..Fantastic birthday dinner had here last night. Charming indoor seating and nice music for a great date night ambiance. Good service too. They have a super nice rosé too. Truffle lovers, you MUST get the mushroom orchiette. Burrata and meatballs to start were great too. I could do without the pizza. They do an extremely crunchy thin crust. Too crunchy for my liking. But the most amazing is the BABY JESUS CAKE. This was the most amazing warm cake experience I ever had -- an amazing date cake with a toffee syrup. Will most certainly be back soon."
"How have I not written about this place on yelp yet? Crazy, this is my go-to place. I'm new to this area and all the food places around here are ok and then delivery fees, plus app fees and tips are out of control. Enter this place, they have their own delivery driver and it's free to have your food bought to you. Amazing concept right, lol. Yea we did this before all that grubhub bullshit! Back to this place. I can have a meal somewhere and then cook it at home better than restaurants normally. But not this place, the style of food is very different. Everything is so DAMN FRESH! You heard the saying, ""you get what you paid for"", if we are hungry and want food in the Greenwood/South Slope area, this is my only place at the moment. I always get the Salmon Kebabs, never had anything else outside of the salmon. I love the peppers, rice with chickpeas, fresh salad, hummus and hot bread roll. This comes in 1 size only which is dinner. I can turn this into 2 meals for myself. I walked a guy right to this place before. He said he passed by all the time and never went in. If you are coming to this area and want real fresh food, come here. If it's not here it's a pizza spot I know of but just not as good as this place. And you have to pay for the pizza to be delivered, again FREE delivery, unheard of..The bread is delicious and I'm giving this place a higher rating for that.HOWEVER:Their mixed green salad said ""stuffed grape leaves,"" PLURAL, but it only came with one, this is an outrage.It was one of those mushy-ass canned grape leaves, even. IT WOULDN'T HAVE KILLED THEM TO PUT TWO IN THERE..Place was definetly lacking in every aspect. Service was bad. Cashier didn't speak English which made it very hard to communicate the order and understand what the menu items were. No stars taken off from that though.I'm giving this place 3 stars merrily off off the food alone. We both ordered a lamb gyro and a side of fries. The lamb gyro came out cold. As if it came out of a fridge. The meat and bread was all cold. I didn't finish half of my sandwich and left. Probably will not return..Fantastic restaurant I ordered Lamb Adana was delicious  and tasty and the bread always fresh I love this place so much.Beautiful restaurant and delicious food I tried mix grill it was fantastic The best restaurant for ever.The best restaurant every thing is super fresh and tasty. I started getting addicted to eating in this restaurant  it's really great .you are the best guys.Wonderful restaurant and   fantastic food I really loved this place  I'm very recommended.A very nice restaurant, this is my first experience from this place and it was a niceexperience. I ordered chicken shish kebab, it tasted very good, the salad and haidari on the side, it was very amazing, the Turkish bread was very fresh and delicious, thank you for this wonderful service, this will not be the last time for sure.I ordered the chicken plate for delivery with baklava. In general, the chicken and rice were not bad. The hummus was kinda taste-less. I liked the Turkish-ish  bread. It was sweet and had seeds on it. Didn't look quite like Turkish bread though. My real issue was with the salad in the meal. It was legitimately old with wilted, brown leaves, and mushy vegetables. It was basically not edible. I was disappointed in my meal. A restaurant should not serve old salad. It's not safe and it's also disgusting..Found this place accidentally. We ordered chicken Adana and chicken doner lunch special. Also had their baklava.Adana and doner was delightful authentic Turkish flavor. Baklava was amazing. $11.99 for lunch specials and $5 for 3 pieces of baklava seems little high to me..The food was deilcious and came on time. I had the chicken gyro on a platter with their delicious turkish bread. Highly recommended.This place is small with a big selection of dishes and friendly service. I ordered lamb adona and chicken kebab. Lamb was a bit dry, but chicken was perfectly cooked crispy  on outside and moist and flavorful on the inside! Rice was perfectly cooked ,and salad  was fresh and lightly seasoned. But was was a definite winner was their bread, which tasted freshly baked! If you are in the area definitely give them a try!.Perfect restaurant I liked they did delivery on time they food more delicious and taste good.So fresh and flavorful, love this place! The salmon kebob is my favorite. It comes with juicy, smoked salmon, flavorful rice, salad, hummus and a fluffy, fresh roll. Really great fresh food, glad they are in the neighborhood."
"If you're looking for a quick bite of Indian food, definitely order to-go or by delivery! They have an absolutely delightful website, where you can find discounts and a reliable food-ordering system.I usually dine-in, however, and my experience never goes wrong. The server is usually a sleazy, but kind and alert, young man. Like many interiors of Indian cuisine restaurants, the space is very colorful and a bit too gaudy. Still, whether you order the chicken tikka masala, sizzling tandoori, or even just dessert, you can't go wrong! The portions are large for me and I always have enough for extra meals - which somehow still tastes great after being microwaved a few times times..Food is extremely bland. Plus we called to ask about allergies and the man on the phone was rude, we couldn't understand a word he said, and when we repeated our question he hung up on us. DO NOT order here. There are much better places for flavorful spicy Indian food in the area.Quite frankly I have not tasted Indian food that's so bland. The biryani tasted like 3 day old pulav that's sitting in the fridge.  Garlic Naan was a big fat dry bread with very little garlic. The beef curry; well I made better food at my hostel. Given that this place has so many good reviews,  I wonder if the regular chef was on vacation.  Hate to post any negative review,  especially during COVID,  but this was just not acceptable..Ordered the vegetarian lunch box and curry lunch box. The food was delicious and you get a good amount for the price. Will definitely order from here again.....I paid how much for what? $40 for one person. Rogan Josh 14.99, tasted fine, but portion was quite small and rice was really dry.Gobi manchurian $7.50, so overcooked I earnestly thought I might have accidentally gotten sweet and sour pork/chicken? Super sugary, super breaded, couldnt find the main ingredient cauliflower.Mango Lassi $3.95. Just what youd expect. Mild flavors easy to drink.Paratha $3.50. I've never had paratha like this before. It wasn't heavy decadent layers of bread and butter. It seemed to be naan, but pressed flat and rubbed with oil?Lemon pickle $2.95, Tasted great, but super tiny portion. About a tablespoons worth.Had I paid $20 buck for the meal, I would not have bothered writing this review. But $40? You can get a really great meal in New York for $40..Pretty solid spot. I must admit I've probably never had authentic Indian but they do vindaloo just like I like it. The naan is thicker than I've ever seen it, but it's really good. Big portions for the price..I ordered their ""Gobi manchurian"" today and although it arrived on time I noticed it was NOT fresh or cooked the same day. The food definitely tasted old like it was just reheated. Their Chicken tikka biryani was also very dry and tasteless. I will NOT tolerate mediocre food establishments who try to trick their customers.Sadly I will NOT order from them again.There are better Indian spots around with better tasting food..Excellent service, delicious food but we were sat in a area that was cold and you could feel the air each time the door opened (after it being cold already in the restaurant). I ordered the shrimp pathia, medium spicy (4), which was nicely paired with garlic naan. I also expected it to be spicier considering it was an Indian Restaurant so if you like spicy like me, have them go 5!.I went in, was seated and told the waiter that I had to be sure that what I ordered was gluten free or i would be very ill. I told him this is not a diet, I would be very sick. He said ok.  My order included an appetizer whose description included ""lentil bread"" among others, he said nothing about gluten so I assumed all was well. He then asked me if I wanted any bread, which set off a mild alarm in my head.When he brought the appetizer out, I looked at the dish and the bread looked a lot like good old wheat bread to me.  I beckoned him over and asked if there's wheat flour in the bread, he said yes. (!!!)I said ""I asked you if it's gluten free"" to which he said ""the bread comes to us that way"".  He then started offering to take the bread out for me.  I told him that if he did not know what I meant or if he did not know, he should've said so.I told him that he would've sent me to the hospital, he had no response so I just walked out.Avoid this place like the plague!!!.Traveling as a family, we were looking for good food close to our rental. The challenge is finding gluten free vegetarian that my daughter can eat and a variety that the rest of us could enjoy. This provided the perfect option.The lamb Tika masala was not spicy, but flavorful. The other dishes, tried by most in the family, were fresh and full of flavor. My daughter's dish (cauliflower, potato and something) was good but fell to the mild side when she requested extra spicy.The service was attentive, polite, informative to those who didn't know Indian food and was the reason for four stars. The food was good, reasonably-priced and I would come here again but would receive 3.5."
"Definitely a pleasant surprise! I walked in cause I was starving and had some time to kill before a hair appointment. Best 30 mins spent. When I walked in, it smelled amazing - like a grandmothers kitchen blessed by the lord himself. Sat down quickly although the place was pretty packed with all native ecuadorian patrons, so I was definitely expecting that this place would be good. I ordered the garlic shrimp plate - it came with salad, totosnes, rice and shrimp, of course. They also gave me a hot sauce on the side, it was so good! But so damn hot! I still ate it cause it really kicked up the flavors that were already on my plate. Service was excellent! The waitress was attentive and made sure that I was happy with my meal. The food came out quickly and that was great cause I was so damn hungry! The place itself is small and decor is beautifully ethnic. There are ecuadorian portraits and paintings, very much feels like a kitchen and a hole in the wall restaurant. A hidden gem for sure. There was also a small TV that was showing a Spanish novela! That was neat! The experience was wonderful, the sounds, smell, taste and appeal! Surprisingly wonderful!"
"I usually don't like to leave and reviews, however I had a salad from there which was very tasty however I got sick after it. Though the food was good I wonder if the ingredients are fresh and clean. I don't think I will be eating here again."
"i live a block away from Pronto Pizzeria and decided to give it a try and came on October 12  with my family of 4 We ordered a Small pie of Margherita and wow it actually looked bigger than i expected. it tasted amazing we also ordered burgers with friesWell the burgers were okay which its understandable because its a pizzeria restaurant but overall we had a good time and were well fed The Sangrias were also Great tasty i would come back again!.Pronto is my place to go when I'm in the area. Grandma pizza is my go to, especially when it's hot fresh out the oven :drooling while typing: I have also tried their rice balls, tortellini e brodo, and I have to say those are pretty up there on the taste board. Needless to say, you gotta try it for yourself..It is hard to review this place with stars.  First, the atmosphere, the food and the pricing are phenomenal.    Customer service; however, seems preferential.  We waited almost an hour for our order, and the waiter wasn't rude, but wasn't friendly either.   In all fairness though, my wife and I both don't drink for medical reasons.  If we were drinking wine, the hour wait for our pizzas would have gone by much quicker.  Furthermore, the venue would have made more than $27 for two HUGE specialty pies off of us.  To that extent, maybe we shouldn't complain.   In the end, let me repeat:  this is some really good Italian leaning  (as opposed to American style) pizza.   I ate the whole thing, felt full, but had no problem waddling out of the place.   The dim lighting and reasonable volume Bossa nova were an added plus..I ate at this place twice. Once to sit down and eat, the other time to get a slice of pizza. The owner here is very rude. First time, when I came to sit down and eat, he gave me a dirty table and was ignoring me when I asked to be seated. There was no one else in the restaurant. He also forgot to bring the table appetizer. Just today, I ordered pizza to go. When the pizza came out, he just gave me the pizza and when I asked for a bag to put the pizza in. He just threw the bag on the counter. Basically, telling me to put the pizza in the bag myself. I don't mind doing it, but this dude is rude. He also doesn't wear his mask in the restaurant and I've seen him breathe heavily over other peoples food when sending it over.  Also the food is beyond mediocre for the price. DO NOT COME HERE. Support another local business in the area. I'm never coming here again..DO NOT ORDER HERE!!!!!!! Worse pizza I ever had in my life. Dough was under cooked , cheese is like plastic & barley any sauce. I called and complained he said he will make me a new pie I been waiting 2 hours now. DONT COME HERE !! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!.Phoned in an order and was told my order would be delivered in 40 minutes. Instead, Pronto, delivered Pronto in less than 20 minutes!Needless to say, I was very impressed. I ordered their Pasta Emiliane, broccoli, garlic knots and a salad. Copious portions of food that were freshly made and piping hot. Mushrooms were fresh, not canned and pasta was well seasoned. I had ordered from there awhile ago, and I would not hesitate to order from them in the future. Delivery guy was friendly and efficient. I look forward to ordering other items on their menu in the future..I usually order a small personal pizza and get broccoli rab on top, so good. Pronto is closeby and my pizza comes really quickly and it's always piping hot and delicious.Pizza tasted like it was old And the world's smallest collect knots Way overpriced.  Don't think I'll be going back there.I came in here last week with my girlfriend and we brought our kids. The owner was beyond accommodating to us. We ordered wine, calamari, a roll, salad, and the Capellini pasta. Everything was so good. We will definitely come back because we had a great experience..BEST PIZZA IN ASTORIA. Hands down. Zero competition. Don't be fooled by the pizza places in Astoria with the fancy Instagram posts- they're TRASH in comparison to Pronto. Every single pie/slice I've gotten from here is out of this world. Their specialty pies are heavenly, and so are their sides. I dream about Pronto. I'm not kidding. Stop whatever it is you're doing and order from them right now. I honestly might after I'm done posting this review. LOVE YOU PRONTO! You've been the best thing about my move to Astoria."
"A decent place to grab a bowl of Pho, broth was flavorful, it certainly hits the spot, beats fighting for parking in flushing.  The noodle was on the soft side, but all in all it was a good experience.  Will definitely come back to try other dishes..I got takeout from here last night and was not impressed. Here was what I ordered:Cha Gio: The spring rolls themselves were fine, but the Nuoc cham sauce was very bland. It didn't have the fish sauce or sweet flavor it should have so that was disappointing.Bun Bo Lui: The dish itself would be good if it weren't for that bland Nuoc cham sauce. The beef was flavorful, but I wish there were more pieces.Pho Bo Vien: The broth was kind of bland and was alright. Nothing to rave about.Overall, this place has potential, but they need to fix their Nuoc cham sauce and work on their Pho..Just okay. I've never met a bowl of pho that I didn't like, but this place missed the mark for me. The broth was extremely concentrated and I suspect that whoever was assembling this bowl didn't put enough plain broth to dilute the flavoring because it was extremely salty and sweet. It tasted exactly how that sounds.. the staff was so nice and offered to dilute the broth, but I suspect they added a bunch of water because then it became tasteless. There was no depth to it. Once diluted, the flavors tasted more like a Taiwanese beef noodle soup than pho, and the braised beef slices also resemble beef noodle soup. The only good part of this dish was that the restaurant was very generous with the toppings. Again, the staff was very sweet and tried their best. However, the beef pho here does not taste like the kind you get in Flushing and Chinatown..A passable Viet spot that left me wanting more. The cubed steak over rice has a good amount of meat for $9.50 but lacked flavor and the rice was hard. The summer roll didn't taste fresh and the shrimp was dry. Maybe it was a slow day for them and maybe the pho would be better, but overall a meh experience..Had a pleasant and satisfying lunch here.My first time going to a Vietnamese restaurant without my bf (he's Vietnamese and so I usually just leave it to him to order; my mom, who was with me, is not much more familiar with Vietnamese food than I am, and all I really know is bun rieu and pho but wanted to expand my food horizon, so to speak). I'm not a big meat eater, but I was craving something meaty, so I ordered the bun dac biet. ""V65??"" Says the waiter. ""Very good. Trust me.""Well I went for it, and what a great decision that was! My v65 (item # on menu; see photo) was delicious! Meat was tender enough (not super chewy, can't stand that) and I loved the flavor of the lemongrass sauce (at first I was worried it would be dry as the dish was not accompanied by sauces in separate dishes, hence nothing to dip my food into...glad I was wrong - the flavor was all there and the sauce in the dish itself was yum!). And loved the subtle crunch of the peanuts in the dish too.And overall good, friendly service.Only downside is that they didn't have tapioca pearls to make my mom's milk tea into a bubble tea. But good experience!.Pho is priced competitively and actually pretty decent. The soup is flavorful that you can choose not to put in the condiment and its still tasty, unlike a few other Pho places I tried in the past where its bland.their eye of round (raw beef) was mixed in with the soup which cooks it, if you prefer it separate, you have to let them know on the phone. I only ordered from here once, not sure if its common practice for them to put raw beef in the soup when its mean to be raw! (then you lightly cook it to your own preference by putting it in the soup) The beef turned out to be tough.the crispy spring roll was great, I really enjoyed that. The crispy calamari was not great ,too much fried batter..ordered pre-made beef round slices (shank , tendon) + omosa (beef tripe, also known as stomach) , about 9 (+tax +tips)soup was savory n tasty (wish it was hotter), beef was tenor, thin slices, thin slices of onion added the sweetness, lime added the sourness, the beef tripe was thinly slices n soft , has a bit of chewiness. typical vietnamese thin noodle, soft n smooth, good texture.come with the standard bean sprout, fresh mint , basil leaves, lime..Solid old-fashioned restaurant with excellent food. Chicken satay perfectly cooked (and plenty of chicken) with a nice peanut sauce. Bun Dac Diet delicious, huge serving. Friendly staff, great atmosphere. Excellent choice, great bargain. Recommended..Enjoyed a really delicious meal here.  Started with grilled beef and pork rolls, followed by Bun Bo Lui for our main dish.  Food was delicious and full of flavor.  Our server was very kind and attentive.  Restaurant was clean and had a very relaxing ambiance.  Would definitely eat here again..Very good Vietnamese and Chinese food here. Outdoor seating during Covid with staff wearing masks. Pho is great. So is summer rolls, Bun Dac Biet, Bun Tom Nuong.  We also love all the green vegetables they have This is a real neighborhood gem."
"Halloween  brunch at The Skillman was fantastic! It was great to enjoy this beautiful day with great coffee  and delicious Eggs Benedict & Omelet. Everyone's as dressed up they were giving away little treat boxes for the kids who were dining and candies for r everyone trick or treating in the neighborhood. Fabulous Halloween Brunch!.Breakfast at The Skillman this morning was A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. Perfect sandwich and let me tell you about this avocado toast, pancakes, and lattes, perfection!!! delicious!!! Stop by and support local businesses!.Service was good, friendly staff! But everything was mediocre, nothing impressive. The best part of the food was the fries & the beer. We got wings & a burger. We wanted the burger medium done but it was more towards well. We wouldn't go back unless we have to, this place wouldn't be our first pick..I came here for breakfast with my friend. We didn't plan to go here, but the one we wanted to go to open in the afternoon. We refused to wait and decided to pursue our hunger game! I ordered French Toast, and my friend ordered the Eggs Benedict. I enjoyed my French Toast that was served with some fruit. I also had it with two eggs Sunnyside up. They make French Toast the correct way by using fresh bread. Then they sprinkled the toast with fine sugar. Fantastic breakfast! I will come back for another round. My friend liked the egg benedict here too!.Decent meal, and service. I'd come back here if someone else suggested it but it would never be my first pick..Great live music, great beer, great vegan options. We had chicken wings, vegan tacos, french fries and lagunitas pitcher. Prices are cheaper than manhattan. Great option if you are in Sunnyside..If you're looking for a laid back, neighborhood joint that is kid friendly with unpretentious food, this might be the right place for you.They have a back patio and outdoor dining with heat lamps and festive decoration for the holidays. Even on cold days, they have patrons dining outside with their children (including fur babies!). The service can be a little on the slow side at times, but why rush your meal when you can sit and chat with friendly locals? Both the in restaurant meals and holiday catered meals aren't cheap but isn't unreasonable considering comparable options in the area as well as portion sizes.If you want to support a local restaurant that supports its community (yes! they donate food to the local food pantry and sometimes a portion of proceeds) consider The Skillmam..Met up here for Saturday brunch to sit curbside (for pupper purposes) and hang out with my core group. New Yorkers have been brunching since before it was cool and the Skillman understands that. We don't always need a view with our meal, but we do need a darn good meal, and I was a very happy camper with the avocado toast - poached egg and all.The Skillman is a play on the street name but also a nod of the skill it takes to craft a good meal. And there were no bones about it, you'll be happy with whatever you find here. I don't normally order poached eggs but I do enjoy a poached egg for sure. I'm just learning how to perfect them at home, so why not order it and remind myself how it's supposed to be done. I think mine was a teensy bit overcooked, but it's still miles better than the first time I poached an egg. I ordered the mimosa with my meal- there's no bottomless option here. Another issue was the table. Our waiter insisted it was rocking because of the uneven side walk, but, the sidewalk was even where we were sitting. My friend and I had to be careful because one uncalculated move and breakfast would have easily been on either of our laps..Montefiore's (Weiler campus) operating room & now critical care team would like to thank you and the rest of your staff for the generous food donation. Everything provided was delicious and we appreciate it very much. Many thanks again! #RestaurantsSupportFrontliners2020 #FoodFuelToFightCovid19.Terrible Service! Homophobic AND/OR racist experience. On March 17, 2021, my husband AND I were trying to enjoy a St. Patrick's Day dinner at the Skillman restaurant. The greeting was Okay and we immediately ordered some drinks. Five minutes later the treatment was completely different and rude. The server and probably all the rest of the staff were trying to hide and avoid eye contact with us. In the beginning, we asked about the food menu but as time passed we were not able to order anything because nobody attended us. We had a weird feeling and felt some type of racism way since it was early and the restaurant was not busy at all. In fact, we were the first table inside and they didn't have more than 3 tables outside; therefore, there's no reason to say that everybody was busy and forget about us. After more than 40 minutes of trying to order some food, I was trying to pay my check because we were tired of waiting for the service. We already had finished with our drinks. By this time, a 7-top table walked-in, and 2 smaller tables were sat inside. The atmosphere changed immediately as I had to go to the bar to close my check. I noticed that the table next to us ordered, got their food and the service was very different from ours (Walked-in 20 minutes after us). We really felt invisible and discriminated against.   When the server saw me, he just turned around and ignored me, again!  The treatment was negligible. We felt uncomfortable and upset that this happened in our own neighborhood. Even during the COVID pandemic, when people need to order food to be able to sit at a table and drink; they said nothing. A very unpleasant and triggering situation for me and my husband.I work in the industry as a bartender in the city, and I am completely sure that it was a disrespectful behavior..I have been dining out lately to help local restaurants pay the bills. This place charges almost twenty bucks for a burger and it was probably fits comfortably within the top 3 worst burgers I've had to pay money over $5 for. The patty was large, dry, and flavorless. The entire burger was flavorless and took a really long time to come out. It might've been a turkey burger because i had to go home and take a nap afterwards. The fries were ok. The waitress was not happy at all to have us. Bad food, bad service, very bad prices. I have been dining out lately to help local restaurants pay the bills but am starting to regret it."
"While we were here, we found out they got a new chef just 6 weeks ago and will be switching their name to ""The Skillman"" soon.  The new chef was absolutely amazing, we tried two of their starters for an afternoon bite and drinks.  Definitely recommend getting the crab cake and burrata.  The presentation was beautiful - the crab cake has the perfect combination of intense flavors within the sauce and toppings.  The burrata was deliciously creamy accompanied with refreshing tomatoes and greens.  Service here was great, our server Chance was awesome.  Can't wait to be back again, they are definitely doing something right!.I have no idea what the name means but I love saying it! This place is a very cool neighborhood spot with brunch being a popular option, it is located on the strip on Skillman with a bunch of other restaurants. I thought it was pretty cool that our waitress had an Irish accent, little things like that matter to me. But the food seemed American for the most part but had some kind of Irish twist that was cool. This was interesting, I don't have a dog, but I appreciate how they encourage the patrons who are dining outside to bring their dogs with them to brunch, I like how the dogs are welcome to dine. Also, check with them beforehand but they have live music as well. Awesome!The food:Eggs Royal with Smoked Salmon with a side of Bubble & Squeak- I really enjoyed this, the salmon Hollandaise was really good, and I had no idea what Bubble & Squeak was but apparently it is like mash potato with some root vegetables. I have never had nor heard of it but it was good and unique, I think they mixed in some leek with the potato. The only issue I had with the dish was the English muffin, it didn't feel like it was toasted at all. Not sure if they toasted it but the bottom muffin was completely soft. Overall a really good dish, but an absolute stunner if that English muffin had some texture. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Fish and Chips- Honestly, I was surprised how much I enjoyed this. I ordered this expecting it to just be OK, but I was really happy with the way the fish and chips came out. The fish was nice and flaky with a nice crunchy batter than wasn't too heavy or oily, the fries were not oily and had a nice texture. They weren't that crunchy but that's fine, it was like it had a nice outer crust than a crunchy exterior to the fry but still a dish to get. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Skillet of Corned Beef Hash and Eggs- This dish came out on a screaming hot skillet so be careful. I thought the hash was super good, I loved how they left the corned beef in large chunks and it also had a nice amount of fat on the corned beef, I felt like the Corned beef was great and they did not skimp on the portion. I enjoyed the potato as well with the eggs, the dish totally worked but the one downside, I did find the dish to be pretty greasy. yelp.com/user_local_phot….I came here with my few friends on Sunday and was happy to see a brunch menu.The long haired girl that seated us was something else, she should not be working at this place because she was just getting me upset. She basically in slow motion dropped our utensils on the table one by one, it was surreal to watch her. I am not sure who was our waiter because we had three people that came to drop off food but nobody checked on us so like other reviews stated the service is terrible and it needs major improvement. We had to ask for more ice tea and our check, maybe because it was hot, staff was too scared to go outside and ask how we were doing. The food, well the food was ok...I asked for eggs over easy and go eggs well done so there you have it. Cute place with outside patio but the food and staff need a revamp.Oh good selection of draft beers as well but you might need to pour that beer yourself..Honesty is the best policy and if The Dog and Duck had been honest, I wouldn't be writing this review update.Earlier this afternoon my friend and I dropped by for brunch. When we arrived, there was only one other table there, and they were finishing up. Shortly after we ordered, a few more people walked in. Over the course of what would become a 45-minute wait, two other tables both ordered and were served their food. When I then inquired about our food, the server told us the kitchen had told her it would be ready in a couple of minutes; it was another 10 before it finally came out. It was obvious they had completely forgotten about it.I had ordered the Irish breakfast, which comes with a side of house made brown bread. However, halfway through my meal, I realized I hadn't been served any and when I further inquired about that, I was served plain white bread, and told that they were out.Because the food took almost an hour to be served, we had nearly finished our drinks by the time it was. Given the mix-up and the wait, as well as the way the server asked if we wanted another round, we therefore assumed that these would be on the house, but later when we were presented with the bill, we saw that they were not. Instead, we were offered two shots of ""vodka with grapefruit juice.""Leaving them untouched, I awkwardly asked if the second round of drinks could be taken off the tab. After confirming that they could be with the bar, and promptly taking back the shots, we were then presented with a new bill, which supposedly reflected their deduction. However, only the tax had been deducted, and I had to send it back a second time. Did they try to deceive us? The tax reappeared on the corrected, final, bill.Today's brunch at The Dog and Duck was one of the worst dining experiences I have *ever* had, and needless to say I won't be back..I've now been here on a couple of occasions, and I definitely don't plan on them being my last!To begin, The Dog and the Duck serves a spectacular brunch. This past weekend my friend and I enjoyed it for the first time. We started out with a mimosa and a Bloody Mary, respectively. The Bloody Mary, complete with bacon, was a flavor-burst! We then continued with orders of the burger and the smoked salmon sandwich. Accompanied by generous sides of fries, both were delicious. And the smoked salmon sandwich (or should I say sandwiches, as there were two) was enough for two meals, and made an easy lunch for the following day. Furthermore, the bread was out of this world!The one other time I was here was to meet up with a friend after work. And over a couple of pints and shares of the artichoke dip and pork ribs, we were able to catch up- and later listen to live music at 8 p.m..Once in a while, I come across a place where my checklist comes true: the food tastes marvelous, the servers provide quick service, the place looks cozy and inviting,the ambience feels perfect, and they give out free smiles. Finally, I found that place! Dog and Duck contains all of those qualities. I ordered the Eggs Florentine and Salmon. Talk about delicious! The ice tea pairs off well with this dish. I like the casual, and friendly  atmosphere. When I stepped into this place, it feels like another place. This place looks quaint and it feels like you were transported  to somewhere in Upstate New York.During brunch, I overheard this woman say, ""you made the perfect martini"". I noticed this place quickly fills up with local patrons. While not busy, the servers take time to talk to each other. You see and hear their connections to each other. This lends a positive feel to this place. When in Sunnyside, make a stop here and enjoy the ambience and atmosphere. I really enjoyed my experience here. I highly recommend this bar/restaurant..It was a rainy, late night in Sunnyside and I was desperately looking for a place where I could order good food and good drinks. I came across this place and I mean let's be serious how good could the food be with the word ""dog"" in the restaurant title but don't be too quick to judge because when it comes to service this is probably one of the top 5 experiences I've had in NYC which is saying a LOT. Since it was my first time I was that annoying customer that asks about everything on the menu but the waitress was so nice and patient and made awesome recommendations. I went with the sangria cocktail, squash lasagna, stuffed burger,  and bailey's cheesecake for dessert. All were AMAZING! The burger was supposed to be stuffed with jalapeños and cheese but halfway through there was no stuffing so the manager offered to take it off the menu and that is what service is all about - you don't have to be perfect but you have to be right. Id pass on the cheesecake next time but there other desserts looked good. Will definitely be coming back for brunch!.New Owners new problems. The menu is very small and limited. The food is Average at best. My biggest issue is with the owners. They posted a ""save our parking sign"" in the front window. I would like to know why they feel the need to support free car parking over the lives of pedestrians and bicycle riders.  Protected bike lanes actually increase business. NO one drives to eat at Restaurants on Skillman Ave..So far I am not thrilled with the renovation and restyling of DND. I miss the booths and vintage wall paper. The current decor is pretty cold, it needs something to soften it up. Removing the booths also seems to have affected the acoustics because it's much louder than it used to be. The burger I had recently was really well seasoned so that was impressive. I used to order the pork chop and roasted potatoes, which is now pork chop, cabbage and fingerling potatoes. I've had it twice since then reno. First time, it was just plain purple cabbage shredded and mixed in w the potatoes. Second time, same but with tomato sauce and yellow peppers on top. It was a weird combination. I don't understand what's going on with their menu so far. :((.July 2012 - Recent trip to Dog and Duck had the best pancakes I've ever had - no question.  They were a little different -- thick, crispy on the outside edges, and a fantastic flavor.  I had them with sausage which was also unique because it seemed to be made with very lean pork and was not gristly at all.2/25/12.  Went for dinner and had the onion and goat cheese tart appetizer and side order of cauliflower w cheese altogether as my entree because I wanted to have room for dessert.  I ordered a beer first - I hadn't had the Midnight Dog Ale they serve so the bartender let me taste that.  Unfortunately I didn't care for it so switched to a half-pint of Negra Modelo.  I love it when places have half-pints because I hate warm beer, don't always want a whole pint, or like to try something else.The food was better this time around - mainly because everything was piping hot.  The onion tart was very good although an actual crust would make it even better.  The cauliflower wasn't anything particularly special - just cooked with a cream and cheese cause that was good but not unique.  But it was hot and it was a good cheese sauce.  For dessert I had the chocolate mousse which is very dark chocolatey and thick and rich.  It comes in a wedge looking almost like a piece of flour less chocolate cake but is all mousse.-  - -  -  - - -   - - -   - - I tried the D&D for the first time today.  I love the decor, especially the wall paper and the orange lit wall behind the bar.  The new tin ceilings and the improved exterior are also such a nice change.  I would give 3.5 stars if I could, but didn't think it quite deserves a 4 yet.I had a glass of chardonnay, and the ham & leek pie with mashed potatoes instead of french fries.  For dessert I tried the pavalova - a dessert that a former roommate who was Irish used to rave about.The food is solid but I think a few tweaks could actually make it very good.  The pie crust was presented a little differently than I've seen before which I liked- a very thin flaky layer cooked flat across the lip of the dish.  The pastry was delicious - hot and perfectly cooked.  The filling of ham and leek was tasty but slightly under spiced and only warm.  One of the first times I thought a restaurant should have added more salt rather than less.  I also considered sending it back asking it to be heated more, but the mashed potatoes were piping hot so I just decided to eat them together. They were less unique than the pie but very good.The pavalova is a really unique dessert for Americans and I'm guessing others who aren't British- and again just a couple tweaks could have made it excellent rather than just better than ok.    It's made with a merengue base  - which was hard to break into so I wasn't sure how fresh it was.  But the flavor was great, and it is topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a cream sauce, and berries.  The berry topping was very light.  It was served on a regular plate - and I felt like it ought to have been served in a dish with sides because it liquified quickly.  I look forward to going back again..It used to be one of my favorite places.  Then they changed hands and decor. It's now too sleek and too open, with no charm whatsoever. It used to have my favorite steak, mashed potatoes or Fries.  And now the steak is thin, not the thick juicy steak it used to be (what they call prime rib is disappointing when you're looking for a place to give you that nice steak you crave. You could've cooked this at home in a pan) they switched to shoe string fries and their mashed potatoes are a little watery, not creamy like they used to be.Go back to the original, this wasn't worth it, and now not worth the price..Walked by the duck and dog a few times and finally ate there today. I fell in love with the butternut squash rissoto! I was not a fan of my tagliatelle shrimp and pesto. But that could just be because I'm not very big on pesto? I ordered it because it sounded good so o figured I'd give it a try. Also had white sangria which was wonderful! I will definitely be going back for the rissoto!Location has in door and out door seating. Indoor is dimly lit. Service was great!"
"Super fun place in Harlem!Harlem Tavern is located near a lot of Harlem restaurants, some of which are pretty iconic. Even when surrounded by so much competition, this place manages to be one of the funnest and tastiest restaurants around.Harlem Tavern is not trying to reinvent the wheel and revolutionize cuisine, it's simple and tasty bar food. Their truffle burger is the perfect greasy escape after a busy week at work (and I say this as a burger lover). Their chicken tenders are some of the best I have had (and I say this as a chicken nugget lover) and the lettuce they add to it is hilarious and always a conversation starter.Surprisingly enough, the drinks are probably my least favorite part of this place - I'd stick with beers/nothing too fancy. Harlem Tavern is worth a visit if you are in the area and want a cool casual place to eat your heart out..Harlem Tavern is a bar with a massive indoor/outdoor seating arrangement. Every game imaginable is playing on one of their many screens (we visited on a Sunday afternoon and a Tuesday evening).The food is decent. I decided on the Truffle Burger with fries. It was decent. On our Sunday visit it was hard to get serviced right away. We waited some time, even after expressing our frustration to a waiter (that wasn't our own). On the Tuesday visit is was much smoother - so it just may have been an off day. All around a decent bar to watch a game..I would say very bad service but the irony is we never got served nor greeted at the booth. I was very patient in waiting. Interesting to say the servers did recognize us but didn't speak nor stop by. I was on a date and we just was there to have a good time. Like everyone else. It seems they were interested in the larger parties rather than a party of two. I walked up to the bar to attempt my order for our booth but I saw a female and male server conversing at the back computer screen thinking they were planning to drop by. So I sat back down. A lot of pointing and passing by and still not even a warm greet. The hostess could have alerted them to inform of a party of two is there but the servers looked to have known what to do. I was embarrassed because I felt as they were picking and choosing rather than doing there job. There was a gentleman with tattoos on his arm in the form of sleeves short and more leaning towards the heavy set with ear gauges. and a tall skinny lady both in the area. We decided to just get up and leave and before I left I walked up to the gentleman that was believed to be our server as he was on his phone waiting for nothing  and I told him that it was really F'd up that they walked by us multiple times and couldn't even say hello. And very disrespectful the manner how they avoided us. He retaliated and used a very bogus excuse to dismiss the fact he and the other server knew they were wrong.  He was stumbling words as he was looking for an excuse and non to back up his behavior. I was very upset and my date was too. So we went to the bar across the street instead. I think the manager or owner should address this because if it happened to me then it's a consistent thing with the picking and choosing, just put yourself in our shoes. How would you feel? Is our dollar not valued there? Was it a race thing or completely a lack of training or know what your Job intel? I hope this feeling doesn't happen again as I am a manager for a gym in the community and I never treat my staff nor members like that. I give 100% effort every time serving the community..These tacos were amazing! The music and the vibe was awesome! They were so juicy and flavorful! For just three tacos, they were incredibly filling. Definitely would come back and try more of their food! FYI! This place is not black owned in case you had the same misconception..Some friends and I were looking for a food spot that stayed open later than 11pm and came across this place. We walked in and were shocked at how big the place was inside. There were a few people seated and a few people standing around the bar. We were greeted immediately. The food was good. It took about 20-30minutes for it to come up which tells me they're cooking everything fresh. It was so good and hot. And the great music playlist and drinks kept us patient. I would definitely go back during the warmer months. I'm sure this place is packed with good food and people..I have never been to Harlem Tavern for brunch and the food was absolutely delicious. I had the chicken and waffles which I failed to get a picture of because I just couldn't wait to eat lol. I was seated immediately and my order was taken right away. I must say the my server Sally was amazing! She was super attentive and friendly. If you are looking for some good brunch food and a chill environment I would suggest Harlem Tavern..Let me beginning saying the food was amazing. The three stars has to do with the service. I went to dinner with friends and ordered the lamb burger as I wanted to try something different. Well let me tell you how I was transported to an alternate universe, a foodie heaven. That was one damn good burger. No, really it was!!!I loved it so much, I have been trying to replicate it at home. I have come close but not perfect. I guess I'll just have to go back soon. Our waiter was not very attentive and unfriendly. Now I don't need a server to become my best friend but I do expect some level of friendliness. I also don't want to wait 30 minutes after we have finished eating for someone to ask if we need anything else. I'll still go back because I need to figure out what's in that burger..Came here to watch USA vs Mexico game with some friends. Great experience and service. With TVs all over and plenty of servers, we didn't feel forgotten and had everything we need to feel comfortable. Would definitely recommend this spot as someone who enjoys sports and general bar food/drinks.Amazing vibe and fantastic place to hang out with friends. Absolutely do not order any drink more complicated than a beer here, though. I had a couple cocktails and each were probably the worst I'd ever had, including the espresso martini on special. Stick with beer to watch sports, and you'll have a great time. The service was absolutely perfect!!!.Monday night dinner. We should have heeded the warning signs as the table next to us was having issues with their service. Service was so slow. SO slow. And it wasn't busy enough to be that slow. Staff was standing/sitting around more interested in their cellphones and each other than the diners. Ordered a starter and weren't given the opportunity to order entrees until well after the starter was finished. Food came out and was edible at best, but definitely not something we'd come rushing back for. After getting our check we finally brought it up to the manager to put it through so we could go. He brought it back without a pen to sign."
"A very lukewarm 3.5/5 for me, bumped up to a 4 for the nice staff, location, and atmosphere!Food wise -- I got the ""VLT"" with mayo instead of pesto bc I have allergies, and honestly I was not not impressed by the sandwich. For something with relatively simple ingredients it was still pretty enjoyable to eat. Was glad to see that a serving of arugula ""salad"" (had some light dressing on it) came with it for extra greens, and also had a decent amount of fries too. I personally like my fried crispier/less floppy or soggy than the ones we got, but if you're a fan of not super potatoey crisp fries you might like these..ATMOSPHERE:Trendy spot for brunch, with both indoor and outdoor seatingFOOD:Shakshuka (4 out of 5): Decent, but I've tasted better shakshukas.   Was a bit lacking in salt and flavor.  Also, seemed like the egg was at the bottom and baked into the dish, whereas I'm used to seeing shakshuka egg more on top and not fully hard cooked.Challah french toast (4.5 out of 5): Nice, light french toast with maple syrup.  The fresh berries balanced out the sweetness of the syrup.Norwegian (3.5 out of 5):  Good if you like lox.  I generally don't see how much you can do with lox in order to make it stand out from just plain raw salmon, so didn't consider this special in any way..Top notch tapas restaurant. Sat outside before going to a show in the area. The service was great and our waiter gave us great recommendations. The food was high quality and filling for tapas. They gave great portions and the price was very reasonable, especially for NYC. Will be a recommendation for anyone asking about tapas. Cant wait to try more off their menu..I came here for a weekday lunch when a friend was visiting. We were walking through Central Park and randomly got hungry. A quick Yelp search led us here and we weren't disappointed.They have a very reasonably priced lunch special for $17 which includes an entree with choice of soup or salad. I had the pan-roasted salmon with the chicken soup. The chicken soup was very comforting and I highly recommend it, especially in the colder weather. The salmon was cooked well with a nice crispy skin though did not have much seasoning. My friend got the burger which he couldn't stop raving about. Overall, we really enjoyed our meal and the service was friendly and attentive as well.While we were pleasantly surprised with the lunch, it seems that they're more known for tapas which we did not have the opportunity to try. However, I do recommend dropping by for a leisurely lunch if you're in the neighborhood..My friend and I chose Ella Social for our ritual weekly breakfast. I was very pleased that even though buzzing at 11 am, we were able to find a comfortable table inside. We had our usual bubbles and coffee. My friend had the Forest omelet (served with home fries and toast), and I had the Avocado Tartin that was served with salad and fries. I chose the option with the fried egg but can skip the egg without skipping flavor or nutrition. They add edamame on the tartin that is good protein too. Both dishes were fantastic. We shared the ricotta pancakes for dessert and were pleased with that as well.  We enjoyed the meal.  Service was excellent too.  Very attentive, friendly, efficient but not rushed service.  Just wanted to make a special mention.Their bubbles is super reasonably priced but they don't do a free coffee refill. I try to watch my caffeine intake and so it is okay for me but other inveterate coffee drinkers may find it frustrating that they won't do refills of just the basic Americano..We ordered take out. For the amount of money we payed, the food did not deliver. My biggest complaint is the amount of oil that was in most dishes. Just a few points: Kofta sliders : Delicious, I'd order again Steak skewers: Tasteless, the sauce that was given on the side was great  (minus all the oil) Chicken dish : Pretty good but nothing too memorable Octopus: pretty good, no complaints Brussels sprouts : AMAZING except for it being DRENCHED in oil . Cauliflower : also amazing, but also DRENCHED in oil Garlic Shrimp : 8 PCs of shrimp and a cup of oil All in all, the flavors are definitely there. They just need to hold the oil (or serve it on the side) We all felt nauseous after our dinner..We were looking for a dinner spot on the early-ish side (around 6pm) on the West Side and saw this place on Yelp. One thing I find great is that since their ""outdoor"" area is still enclosed with a plastic covering, the restaurant requires all customers to show proof of vaccination. I'm sure a lot of people won't like this, so they can go eat somewhere else. This place isn't huge but had good business anyway. The inside is a bit cramped.  Getting to the restroom involves squeezing in between the end of the bar and the counter in front of the kitchen, then downstairs. And the service initially was very slow, but our waiter did acknowledge and apologize for it. He was very friendly, but I sensed a lot of the other staff weren't. My wife and i got two tapas plates and two entrees, and that was plenty enough food! The Brussel sprouts in particular were outstanding. Not overwhelming; just enough lemon and oil  and a slight char from the roasting. The bravas were also very good. The main dishes were great too. My wife had the burger and it came out great. I ordered the chicken dish and again, a good size portion. The cauliflower and sweet potato sides were excellent complements. We were too full for dessert and I don't remember seeing anything tempting. But for tapas and a nice meal this hit the spot..Ella Social is the kind of spot you go to for your typical instagram brunch. Its very well designed, has a cute layout and the vibes are on point. However, this place is understaffed in my opinion. We went on a Saturday and arrived as soon as they opened, we were seated immediately but there seemed to be only one server for the 8+ tables they had outside. It took forever to get orders in, food delivered and to get our check. We ordered the chorizo panini and smoked salmon benedict and the food was pretty and tasted decently, however I did find the panini to be on the dry side. Overall it was ok..I came here on a Tuesday afternoon (5pm) and we selected this restaurant as the menu had different options. We were a party of six although they do not take reservations they had available seatings indoors and outdoors.  We were immediately seated our server arrived quickly and asked about drinks.  For cocktails i was able to try DELIRIO & FLORIDITA . The cocktails were refreshing. The floridita was my favorite.  For appetizers we ordered empanadas and sliders they were good but just keep in mind portion size are small. For our main dish we wanted a paella the server seemed bother as she said we should of ordered it as soon as we arrived as it takes time to make but it was our first time here and we only had about 20 minutes into sitting. She mentioned the tables are timed and would see if they can make the paella quickly. However, we didn't see any other parties being rushed to eat especially being that there were plenty of tables available. When our paella came out i was disappointed from the presentation to the taste the bottom rice was burnt. I also got to try the the lemon chicken it was flavorful.  The entrana ""skirt steak was also cooked delicious. My however the side orders we got fries and  they were drenched in oil.  My brother got a  Shepard salad with chicken and he said it was okay..This place has a cute vibe when we arrived. It's for nice indoor and outdoor seating with separators in place, so definitely covid safe. We asked them to hold a table for 6 of us on the phone as they don't take reservations and they did for about 10-15 mins, which was great.The food itself was ok, but definitely not some of the best tapas in nyc. The sauce on the patatas bravas was good, but severely lacking salt. The chorizo was great taste wise, but swimming in a pool of oil which made me slightly nauseous to look at. The garden paella was pretty tasteless and I ended up dumpling a lot of Cholula and salt just to finish my plate. I would definitely get the paella with some kind of meat if you do."
"Wandering around the neighborhood...... my better half says ""This place looks nice, lets stop for a drink"".BAM!Awesome experience.We sat at the bar. There was a guy who had a little too much and was doing that annoying ""lets talk to strangers when they can't understand my slurring act"" which always makes everyone uncomfortable. Guillermo (sorry if I spelled it wrong) was the bartender. He quickly and politely diffused the attempt, got us two glasses of a nice Grenacha blend, and boldly stated that the tapas were some of the best in the city.(from what we could understand he got drunk somewhere else, not at Ronda, and the whole scenario was handled with discretion and he left shortly after)He went to bartender score 1000 just for saving us from the awkward ""try to ignore the drunk guy"" game, but he got 200 more points for being spot on about the food. (is there even some kind of bartender point scale? where is this even coming from?)The food is nothing crazy, nothing fancy, just really good food. Papas Bravas were just like in Barcelona, the roasted cauliflower can't be missed, the pane con tomate was refreshing.  Guillermo turned out to be one of the most interesting and friendly people we have met in a long time, and what was supposed to be a quick glass of wine turned into a few hours of good wine, good food, and good conversation. What is more authentic Spanish than that?.This charming restaurant is on a busy street, but even sitting outside, the cozy tables and food draw you into your own little world. I came for a tapas dinner with a friend and was amazed at how our waiters managed to continuously rearrange the dishes on our tiny table to accommodate everything. First, the bravas, which are essentially spicy and cheesy roasted potatoes. Incredible. The potatoes are cubed with little toothpicks and if you're like me, then you agree that food tastes better when speared with a little toothpick. We also had the espinicas (spinach) salad, which was huge - I took leftovers. Could have used a little more goat cheese but was delicious nonetheless. The empanadas are amazing (I had the cheese kale one) as are the kale and black bean croquettes, which came with a fiery jalapeño tapenade. Finally, we shared one of the shrimp tapas. Can't remember which ones exactly, but the shrimp were tiny and extremely flavorful. The outdoor seating is lovely. Go before it's too cold!!.I'm a bar gal. While I don't mind getting a table, I prefer the ""get in and get out method,"" because you're able to order from the menu without ever waiting for a table. And (don't tell anyone), you get the best service. :) Cafe Ronda did not disappoint. Tapas are probably one of the sexiest types of foods out there...bite-size morsels of food covered with sabor and heat. Yes. We ordered an array of food: from the Entrana a la Brasa con Romesco (grilled skirt-steak with an almond-pinenut-dry chile romesco) - kiss me. The Brazas - spiced rough-cut potatoes with a delicious aioli, to a salad to the grilled octopus.  Heaven. The bartender was lovely... kept pouring us glass after glass of vino. Just the way I like it. Get me drunk and full and I'm the happiest woman in the world..I've been here at least three times since my last review. The baked eggs are tremendous. I also highly recommend the chicken skewers with a spicy green parsley marinade. INCREDIBLE. Maybe the best chicken skewers I've ever had. The cauliflower side is excellent, as are the mushrooms And the spinach salad about the best of its kind I've had: plentiful, flavorful baby spinach with grilled onions, mushrooms, apples and goat cheese. The pitcher of sangria is 40 and a good deal if you're with a lot of people. The patio is still closed but in summer, it's nice to sit outside. This is casual /upscale dining, not a tablecloth restaurant, but it has been equally excellent every visit. Also the happy hour is nice: you get a break on wine and a few other cocktails. One criticism: Terrible boring bread for dipping. Not worth the calories or carbs. The bread for the sandwich is okay, or perhaps it's just that these giant and excellent sandwiches (definitely the best deal on the non-brunch menu as you can share) make up for blah bread..I loved my lunch here the other day but since I tried only two dishes, I will leave it as a 4 though the service is very slow but friendly. I almost always leave 20% and I left 15% (this was generous) My server just forgot about me. Now, I did say I would sip the second wine but it took three requests (two to the busboy and one to another server) to get it so that I could sip for a bit before having to beg for a check. The tapas here are about medium to high in price but my corn on the cob (just 6) was magical. It has a cheese and spice layer around it and I could have eaten two easily. I ordered the shrimp as my second dish and if one lived around here, one could boil up some pasta and have a TERRIFIC pasta for two at just 11 or 12 bucks. I thought the shrimp were flavorful and large and the sauce is low-oil but very flavorful and garlicky. Yum. The ladies next to me ordered one of the sandwiches and it was HUGE and looked amazing: mushroom, cheese, spinach and basil I think. That's the bargain: 13 bucks and enough to take some home or to split. The wines are what you'd expect in this area: they start at 10. The selection is good: 5 Tempranillo by the glass ranging from 10 to 13 or 14. I was there at 2PM on a weekday and if the service is this bad at that post-lunch rush time, I can only imagine how badly it sucks at dinner or a busy weekend lunch. The brunch is supposedly amazing and the omelets--large and sophisticated--no more than a regular cheddar cheese and mushroom at a normal diner. I will absolutely be back for brunch. It's cute inside, though. I am happy to have it so close to Luigi, where I dance (68th between Columbus and CPW).I'd say a 4.5 for the food and a 2 for the ambiance/wait, but I'll be generous. Waiting for breakfast at 10 am on a Saturday right after running a race in the park is not my idea of a good time, but it was my own fault for voting for the UWS over East. Somehow the options feel very limited at this time in the 60s and 70s, and you're in heavy competition with babied families.Eventually, when the eye candy hostess sat us down, we all enjoyed our breakfasty brunch--French toast, omelet, and my Benedict Wellington--a medium rare filet and a bed of spinach deliciously separating me from the Hollandaise-soaked poached egg. The cafe con leche (this is a taperia, after all) and bloody mary were also very good.If you can live with a wait and don't mind the sea of babies around you, go for it..1.) Just to warm you up:I heard this place made great tapas, but the Yelp review stated otherwise. It was a cold day and I wanted to be somewhere warm, trying to make a personal opinion of their food.2.) What your eyes may see:I went in for around 7pm. It was dim, busy because it was about full to capacity. My friends and I say at a high top table. The place had almost rustic feel to it. Cream, orange and khaki brown colors. The kitchen you can generally see from the dining area. This is seems to be an all Hispanic staff, ranging from South American to Latin Caribbean. Each position had their own outfit. The chefs wore white aprons with black pants, hostesses wore skirt and black blouse, bartenders, runners and bussers wore all black.3.) Food:My friends and I ordered the Paella de Mariscos ($34), Prawns a la plancha. Olives tapas, Octopus (pulpo), cheese and vegetable empanadas, flan and crepes. We also ordered a 2-liter of red sangria. Besides the sangria, I liked the prawns, empanadas and paella. The empanadas were light in salt, crispy on outside and rich and creamy on inside. Paella was HUGE. Ask for a portion for 2 and you can make four adult stomachs content! For dessert we ordered flan and panqueues de Leche which were like crepes. The flan was very tiny but tasty, and the crepes which was filled with chocolate on inside and served with a scoop of ice cream, were rich and creamy.4.) Service:I believed the staff as a whole were great. From the host up to the manager. They were friendly, polite, quick and made sure our table was constantly kept clean. Waters weren't refilled often, and my napkin fell and it appeared they never acknowledged it, because I never got a new one.5.) Impressions:I thought the food was generally good, the staff were generally good. Is this place awesome for tapas? Well I know others that definitely top this place, but if I'm ever around that area again I might stop by..Great place to come with friends to...didn't quite know how to order so luckily I had a friend who knew what she was doing.  Portions are small which I assume are pretty typical.  Chil; place and would come back again.I first came here with a couple friends and we loved it.  Then I just kept coming back. Their sangria and the food are amazing.  We've never had a bad time here.  Also, the service is great!  A bunch of us were drinking at the bar and knocked over a sangria glass ... the bartender took the glass, cleaned the area, took out a new glass, and refilled her sangria -- YAYY!We haven't had anything here that we didn't love and wouldn't get again.  I'll be back again and again.  Keep it up!.I had a lovely brunch experience at Cafe Ronda. It's a very small, warm, and cosy restaurant, with happy waiters, and happy customers. I ordered a blue cheese burger which was packed with so much blue cheese, it looked like the fungus was growing in front of me! (This is a good thing, despite how it sounds). It's like they read my mind! ""Man I hope that my burger is SUPER PACKED with blue cheese and nothing else"". The meat itself was also very flavorful and perfectly cooked to tender pinkness. Also the bun was nice and sweet, just the way I like it.I also tried the Ronda Eggs which I felt were a little overpowered by the red sauce. Maybe order it on the side? Also THIS IS IMPORTANT: If you order anything with poached egg, make sure you tell them how you want them, because if not, they will make them poached hard! This was disastrous to me because I love soft poached egg, and I think the runny egg yolk would have changed the dish completely.If I lived here, it would be my go-to neighborhood brunch place. Again, I love the cosiness of it, and their dishes are all very well thought out and well executed..Cafe Rhonda has a great vibe. It's pretty dark inside and semi-loud, but it's great for a big group gathering. They have a lot of good dishes to share. The paella is delicious and extremely filling. It's great to share but I have never actually been able to finish it in one sitting.The sangria is great and also easy to share. And so yummy. We really just go crazy over everything we order. I can't actually remember what dishes we ordered, but literally everything we got we wanted more of. It's a fun, festive kind of place that I always enjoy going back to when I'm in the area."
"I go there very often during lunch hours and its always crowded.They definitely serve quality food.Their prices are steep too.Their staff can be ver uncooperative at times.I am a big fan of their eggplant Parmesan with spagetti.I can easily make two mini meals of it.There aren't too many good places around here.If you happen to be here, try them..Their food won't disappoint you..their prices and the staff might..There's only one person who works here and knows how to slice and toast bagels. Today I got someone else and she always does this..I work near by and love coming here daily! the staff is kind and everything is tasty and fast to order. i was extremely taken back by the female manager today who was standing at the entrance extremely rude tell me not to enter without a mask. i have no problems wearing a mask and often do . i was asking the cashier if they had extras and this lady, who i later found out was the manager was shouting over me telling me no and to leave. definitely not a way to treat someone who works next door comes often. i left got a mask and came back as i was on my short lunch break . she by then was hiding in the back and glaring at me while the rest of the staff chatted with me as i'm a regular. staff and food great. however the manager is completely awful. !!! plz find new management.Food is good tasty and fresh but extremely overpriced. Clean place and friendly staff but i still dont feel like paying for their rent. Very pricey.Be careful though. If they drop a bagel on the floor accidentally it still may be served to you..Terrible matza ball soup. The soup is brown and smells and taste terrible. I would not recommend getting that here..I really dislike writing bad reviews, but I was extremely disappointed with the service I received. I recently used Blake & Todd Restaurant & Caterers for a meeting in the UPW. While they were very responsive and great at catering to our needs for the order, they completely failed to follow through on the day of the delivery. I ordered the Boardroom Package. It included an assortment of Sandwiches with a Choice of Salad and Pasta. Accompanied with Cookies & Brownies.They delivered the assortment of sandwiches with salad dressing and forgot the salad and pasta. I called them and they didn't seem apologetic at all. They explained they forgot and because of our location, they wouldn't get to us in half hour. Once, they delivered the salad and pasta, I realized they didn't bring the cookies and brownies!! The best part of the meal. Yea... by this point, I didn't even bother asking for the cookies and brownies. The food wasn't terrible. Personally, the wraps were too small. I've had better. Note, I will not be ordering from them again..Sometime we just dont learn do we? I picked up a slice of banana bread as I was craving some sugar.I got back to my office and cut this up in small pieces to share with my colleagues and it was dry and hard like a rock.Not only that, it also had a stale oil/butter smell.Since I was not having it all myself it was gone in no time.I couldn't stop myself and called the restaurant to let them know.The cashier who answered the phone said OK Thanks and I will let the manager know and before I could say anything she was gone .I couldn't help but stare at the handset in disbelief that she had actually hung up on me..It saddens me to write this review today.Anybody who knows me knows of my obsession with B&T's Eggplant Parmesan Pizza and Mushroom and Barley Soup.I probably get my lunch from this place atleast 4 times a week and sometimes all 5 times.Long after my colleagues stopped going here because of these dismal customer service and their snooty staff, I continued visiting this place because honestly I never had any bad encounters.My trips to blake and todd never lasted more than 2 minutes.I was never custom ordering so required minimal interaction with their staff.Today,at 11.30 am I went down to get some hot soup to get some relief from the aching throat.They had just set up the soups station.I got my usual Small Mushroom Barley which is $5.20 with tax.It comes with a small piece of bread which you always have to ask.Today as usual, I asked for the bread and the lady behind the soup station said they don't have it yet. And if I buy any other bread they will charge me 1.50.I was obviously shocked. I am here almost everyday and you will charge me for a small piece for bread that you are supposed to give me with soup anyways.The fact that you have the soup station set up which means you are ready to serve soups and you should be prepared with the bread too.I walked over to the cashier and she knows me very well and I was pretty sure if I tell her she wouldn't really mind.This latin girl is short dark skinned and is always wearing the uniform white hat.I couldn't believed what she did right after I explained to her.She shouted across the room to the girl at the soup station and asked her if she had the soup bread.Didn't I just tell you that she said she didn't have soup bread, why would you ask her again. After the girl said no, this cashier girl tells me..'Sorry honey they don't have it "" and she completely ignored me and started joking with the other cashier girl.I just grabbed my soup and walked out of there and vowed never to return again to this place which serves good food but does not know how to treat their customers. This place clearly lacks a good manager as you see the staff constantly yapping away to glory even at their busiest lunch time and every single person in my office has experienced the staffs terrible attitude towards their customers.Sorry honey you lost your most regular customer today.I know you don't care but I wish you or your management would stand up and look around how dissatisfied your customers are.Running a restaurant is not just dishing out good food but also treating your customers well and there is a serious learning for your staff in there..Very conveniently located in the heart of diamond district and is a great lunch spot for a quick sandwich, salad or pizzas.They even have made to order pastas and sandwiches.I have tried everything here and they definitely use high quality produce and ingredients.And of course their prices are not your regular deli prices..A decent salad comes to around 8-9 bucks that you you would be scrimping on the add onsBut when you walk into this place just remember one thing "" THEY MAKE THE BEST EGGPLANT PIZZA"" .......I would literally live on this pizza for the rest of my life if it could only make a me a teeny tiny promise me that it wont start having a love affair with my love handles...Their pizza guy is the best and they make some mean eggplant parmesan pizzas and sandwiches..their food quality is top notch..i could have their eggplant parmesan pizza every single day...Very bad. Had several instances when I could have ended up in a hospital with their negligence towards food, equipment and sanitary. Lets start with them giving me a smoothie that had crushed broken plastic. I felt like perhaps sugar did not dissolve and kept drinking it until I was curious to see what the F am I drinking. Touched it with fingers and it was super small clear like sugar but plastic pieces. Hey did I mention I was pregnant at that time? I went absolutely nuts in that place; had the manager have it. And was like are you out of your mind to even offer me another one? I told her she can have one for me. Salads are always different price. Everyday you can be having the same salad but they will charge you different price. Overpriced lunches too. Go to Alice (former Blue Flowers) instead. On the same side across 5th ave..This place is really great. I stumbled past it and it looked really clean so I gave it a go. There is seating in the back corner of the place for dining in. The seating area is a pretty good size. This place has pizza, sandwiches, salads, and a hot food and salad bar. Lots of options. The decor is really nice and super clean. There was a huge line because I went right at noon but the line went super quick. The service was awesome and the price was very reasonable. I got a big salad with five toppings and it was only $7.50. I'll be back to this place for sure."
"Over the weekend, my mom was craving Schnipper's burgers lol... never been to this location, only the one by E 23rd street(which i heard have permanently closed )I decided to order online, dad drove me there to pick up the order. I ordered 3 Schnipper's classic burger, 1 fries, and 1 sweet potato fries. Service was quick and friendly. Food was nice and hot when received. But by the time i got home, the fries were kinda soggy and cold(damn you cold weather!)Other than that, burger was juicy and flavorful, fries tasted great besides the cold and sogginess lol!I really miss their shakes... probably gonna grab one next time maybe lol.While down in NYC for the weekend with my family, we decided to drop in here for a bite to eat. The menu and customer-provided pictures looked great. It was also nearby our hotel. So we had high hopes. However, the food and our experience wasn't anything stellar.The staff members working were professional and courteous. They provided some recommendations on menu items. I ordered a Buffalo chicken sandwich. The chicken was dry and lacked any type of spice. And as you can see in the picture, the chicken wasn't even hot enough to melt the single slice of cheese placed onto it.In addition to the subpar sandwich, there was a disruptive person inside the restaurant yelling and behaving in a threatening manner towards the woman he was with. I'm not sure if the staff members knew him or not. However, I was a bit surprised they didn't attempt to remove him from the restaurant after several minutes of his disturbing behavior..I really don't eat Turkey burgers outside of my home. Too many bad experiences. But after walking around NY and needing food but not to be slowed down I went with the Turkey burger at Schnipper's. Hit the spot! It was not dry, which is usually the problem. Seasoned to perfection. Juicy. The extra added ingredients made the burger a delight. So glad I went for it. And you can never go wrong with sweet potato fries. There were a ton in the cup. Share if possible..We traveled to NYC and I tried to find some quick lunch food. We both agreed the food here is expensive, basic food. Not Impressed. (To respond to the owner's comment) We got a burger (which my husband stated tasted like Mc Donald's), chicken tenders (not bad, but definitely not worth the cost), and sweet potato fries (desperately needing salt)..All I'm going to say is wtf, it has great menu and amazing floats but depends who's working is how great your food will be I've been here many times before but this this WTF. How do you forget the most important part of the burger ?.It's been three years but I never updated this. Andrew Schnipper, the owner and CEO, personally contacted me to apologize for this incident and showed up to my office to present me with a small gift card to Schnipper's for the inconvenience. I think it's only fair to update this review with that information, it was a great display of customer service. I never used the gift card since I moved, but I respect the effort..I order often from Schnipper's as they have a low-cost menu. Today, I ordered something through our corporate account from Seamless and there was a bug cooked into the food (picture has been uploaded, you can see a cooked up ladybug clearly in the burger). This is disgusting. But mistakes happen, no matter how sanitary a kitchen is, something can go wrong that is beyond the staff's control. I was willing to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt. I called Seamless and they called the restaurant, the manager or whomever, Michelle, instructed Seamless that I should contact the restaurant directly and that they will take care of it. I called back within a few seconds of being told to contact the restaurant - and Michelle was on a break. This is beyond unprofessional. If a customer has an issue and you told them to call you, you take care of that issue before going on your break. It's a waste of my time and disrespectful to me as a customer to make me stop what I'm doing, call you, and find out that you don't really care about the situation enough to do anything about it. That is completely in the staff's control, and that is not an error that can be given the benefit of the doubt. A customer could not eat their lunch, probably hungry, while you go off on a break and I'm told to call back after half an hour. So I have to tell my team that I need to get off the desk in half an hour, again, after already wasting 15+ mins of company time trying to get this issue resolved. I'm sorry, but that's poor customer service and a very bad judgement call by someone who is supposedly the ""manager""..Not a fan of their burgers- the grilled onions were strong and bitter, burger sauce not very flavorful, and the burger meat not tender. Two of us had hard inedible chunks in our burger meat too.Fries were pretty good through, and looks like they have nice shakes..My number one go to spot for lunch when at work in the City. This place is delicious with a great staff who takes pride in the food they serve. Alicia C., the  cashier I see whenever I come in has been A great host. She always greets me with a smile and enthusiasm. Great place to grab a quick fresh bite during work or on the go in the city. Lots of healthy and soul satisfying options. Compliments to the cooks and staff!.My first time trying Schnipper's was at this location and I loved it. They have burgers, fries, shakes, sandwiches, onion rings, mac and cheese, hot dogs and more. They even have salads! It's like way better fast food. The first time I went, I got their salted nutella shake, mac and cheese, the Schnipp (their classic cheeseburger) and chicken fingers with sweet potato fries. I love their sweet potato fries. I got a bunch of sauces with to eat the chicken fingers with. They were all really good. Everything is really delicious. The mac is so cheesy and addictive. I highly recommend going there. They have something for everyone..Didn't take any pictures but the grilled chicken sandy was super delicious along with the fries. It was a quick food run but it definitely was something I would come back to."
"Wow this place was PERFECTION. - all four dishes were superb! My favorites were the oiji bowl and mushroom salad. I loved the chili lobster and but the duckling felt a little too rich and buttery for me.- the staff was very attentive and knew the dishes very well- our total was 140$ after tip- I went with my mother and we were both very full and satisfied after these four dishes!- I would recommend this place for dates  can't wait to come back- the menu is small, but the quality of the food is incredible and each dish has many different layers of flavor and texture.  You will enjoy a visit to Oiji!.Was really looking forward to trying this spot, but was pretty underwhelmed with the food itself and disappointed in the lack of flexibility in removing allergens from dishes (specifically shellfish - there was oyster sauce in everything, sadly). All in all great service, but the food portions are mainly just way too small for their $ worth..Oiji service was excellent! Seamless reservation and seating :) The servers were constantly refilling our waters and checking in. 5/5 The food was overall tasty. My friend and I ordered 4 dishes between the two of us. We ordered wagyu special (off menu), baby octopus, chili lobster, and Long Island duckling. The wagyu special ($32) was underwhelming unfortunately. While the showmanship of scorching the wagyu at your table is exciting, the lukewarm temperature was a little off putting when we had it. The baby octopus was really good, charred and crispy; sauce was rich with a hint of citrus. One of my favorites was the chili lobster; it is a cold noodle dish but I felt like the noodles were so juicy and chewy. It strikes me as an elevated mentaiko cream pasta.My friend's favorite dish was the Long Island duckling which she described as juicy! I think it was a nice little dish. Not gamey, not overly cooked/chewy. Comes atop of some rice I think. But as it was the last dish, I was already getting full so I didn't have as much. I think this is a nice date restaurant! An intimate, dark, romantic spot that is a little more expensive if you're trying to impress but not too hard..Went here with a group of friends and the food was so good! Will say it is pricy and the proportions are quite small for what you pay, but the food is definitely tasty and modern. Now let's rate the dishes! Foie Gras - 4.5/5Foie gras was so delicious (but foie gras is always delicious), and the rice cracker with it added a nice modern twist. Nothing to hate on here, just the dish was so small. We got 4 pieces for 4 people, its definitely a one biter but a tasty dish nonetheless.Baby Octopus: 5/5Octopus was cooked perfectly, not too chewy and not too hard. And the sauce that went with it was so good! Tomatoey, sweet, slightly tangy, great complement to the octopus.Chili lobster: 5/5Came with a good amount of lobster chunks, the noodles were perfectly cooked, and the chili sauce!! Man the chili sauce was awesome, tangy, slightly spicy, slightly sweet, clung to the noodles and lobster very well.Oiji bowl: 4.5/5First impression: very small. Probably smaller than my fist. We had to share this dish with 4 people so we each got one spoonful haha. We got the Maine urchin option instead of the Hokkaido urchin but still very good. Fried chicken: 4/5It was good fried chicken. It was more like a blanched chicken with crispy outsides than a traditional fried chicken with heavy breading. But I liked how flavorful it was with the soy sauce. A simple dish but a yummy dish. And I liked that it wasn't tiny lol.Ssam platter: 5/5Loved the sticky rice, loved the pork, it was juicy and flavorful. The sauces that came with it were good but was overpowered by the pork seasoning. I wish it came more lettuce cause there was meat leftover and no more lettuce, but a very good dish. All the elements combined together were amazing.Honey butter chip ice cream: 5/5Super innovative, a little pricy. I thought itd just be the bagged honey butter chips and vanilla ice cream, and since most of the dishes were small I thought this would be small. But it was not small! Wasnt huge but a good portion for 4 people. The honey butter chips seemed to be made fresh, they were perfectly crispy but become slightly chewy and soggy when mixed with the vanilla ice cream, but in a good way. They drizzled honey in the ice cream and man it was sooo good. Sweet, slightly salty, crispy, perfect dessert!.The ambiance was really great! It feels super cozy and great for a night out dining with your girlfriends or boyfriends. Just a heads up, you should make a reservation in advance as it can get super packed. My favorite was definitely the chili lobster noodles dish. Overall, my experience was pleasant..Overall, food is quite good but overpriced for sure.Ssam platter: 4/5 spicy pork butt/gochuchang wrap/sticky rice. good but nothing really stands out and the price is quite high, u can probably get quite similar things at other Korean bbq places at a cheaper price. Oiji bowl: 4/5 sea urchin/sweet shrimp on seasoned rice and pickled vegetable. Tasted good but overpriced. Small portion. Great presentation. Not sure if I would pay this 36 dollars again for this though.Waygu beef: 4/5 I couldn't taste these very thin slices of beef in the overwhelming amount of sauce. Although the sauce tasted good with the egg and torch cooking was interesting. I would never pay another 36 dollars again for this. Too overpriced for the beef that didn't stand out..Wow, wonderful food and a great overall experience dining in one of their outdoor cabins.Not a very large menu but enough of a selection to try a variety of dishes (which are served family style). There was not a miss in the ones we selected: Foie Gras, Mushroom Salad, Oiji Bowl, Baby Octopus, Long Island Duckling, Oxtail and the Honey Chips with Ice Cream for dessert.  They were all terrific with perhaps the Oxtail standing out the most - great flavor and the meat was so tender.The service was wonderful with the servers operating as a team. Even though we were sitting outside, there was always someone making sure that our water glasses were refilled.As others have noted, Oiji is a little pricey but well worth the cost..Wow stop reading and go to Oiji right now! This was by far one of the best dining experiences I've had in a while. My sister and I were seated at the bar, which at first I was worried about but it was so cool seeing the bartender make the drinks. Everything was so delicious. By far my favorite dish was the special wagyu but you can't go wrong with any of the dishes. Also the vanilla ice cream with honey chips for dessert is a KILLER. Can't wait to come back for another delicious meal..We made a reservation for dinner at Oiji on a weekday evening. They currently have both indoor and outdoor seating (their outdoor seating area has a cute little neon sign w/ the restaurant name on it!). We were a little uncertain as to what to order, they recommended the combination of two small plates and two large plates, but we settled with one small plate and two large plates and felt full afterwards. We ordered the baby octopus, bone marrow, and ssam platter. Baby Octopus: It came with 5 or so small pieces and it was not extremely chewy (something I find can happen with octopus). The sauceBone Marrow: This was super interesting! It came with crispy rice crackers (a little salty with a touch of vinegar flavor) and a tiny little metal spoon used to scoop the short rib/bone marrow onto the cracker. There was also a small assortment of vegetables to stack onto the cracker as well. Unfortunately I found that they gave us too few crackers to meat ratio, or I was just too stingy with the meat at the beginning. Ssam platter: This was definitely my favorite dish by far. It was extremely filling (I also skimped out on the meat at the beginning, in fear that there wouldn't be enough wraps). I was a little surprised to see sticky rice (wrapped in a lotus leaf), as it's traditionally a Chinese dish. Each component of the wrap paired together perfectly, the meat was tender and the leeks were fresh and crisp. The sauce was also delicious..4.5 Stars.  Definitely worth a visit!Service 5/5 - Our server was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.  He offered personal recommendations and had the perfect tableside manner. Food was coursed out nicely and the entire meal was done in 90 minutes.Space 5/5 - We dined in one of their private outdoor booths which was private, heated and cozy.  And servers all were masked while inside our booth which was great for any COVID concerns.  Our booth had a call button to summon our server (we never had to use it though).Food 4/5 - The menu is small, but has great variety for lovers of Korean/Asian flavors.  My only critique is that some dishes tend to skew sweet.  We tried the Australian wagyu special (seared tableside), mushroom salad (our favorite), fried chicken (tender but with crunch from the tapioca breading), Maine Oiji Bowl and bone marrow (the short rib was quite sweet).  And we finished with the honey butter chip ice cream, which was also quite sweet.Value 4/5 - Dishes are a bit expensive for the size and they recommend a party of two order 4 to 5 dishes.  The Oiji Bowl, which was around $32 was quite tiny -- about the size of a closed fist.  Of course it's filled with expensive ingredients like uni and shrimp but I think perhaps ""Oiji Cup"" would be a better description.Overall this is an excellent restaurant -- tone down the sweetness a bit on a few dishes and this is approaching 5 star territory."
"I've been a customer for 25+ years and I'd put the food here in this whole in the wall pizzeria up against any Italian restaurant in the BX or even all of NYC for that matter. There are a lot of pizzerias in the Bronx and this is my #1 spot. (Full Moon is 2nd) Everything they make is delicious. Just come in and eat a cheese slice fresh out of the oven and you'll understand why. Get some of the best garlic knots you'll ever have too and while you're there, check out the menu and order something to go. The margarita pie/pizza is a must! I also recommend getting a chicken parm hero on garlic bread (thank me later), BBQ chicken roll, vegetable lasagna  etc. you name it they have it and make it fresh to order!  Anthony and his dad are good peoples! The workers they employ have been around for years and they are the best! Mangia!.Excellent pepperoni pizza and Rigatoni with meatballs was beyond my expectations!Wow and yum!.The hot wings are so.good. Pizza is good - obviously. I don't know the guys name who I usually see working in the front, younger man, but he's got good energy, makes the place that much better. Whenever I order for delivery, they make good timing so. That's it. Not a single complaint. But this is my go to spot for the wings tho. I won't stop talking about those.  imma take a picture next time so you could see..Anthony & Sal's Pizza Express is still fast with delivery and still yum!.I opened a Yelp account so I can start participating on a platform such as this because it helps me make informed dissensions. This is my 1st review of more to come. Since they opened, I have consider A&S's Pizza Express the new guys in the neighborhood because I've lived and eaten pizza here all my life. That being said, this pizzeria blows most of the old school shops on Morris Park away for a number of reasons I will mention now. Keep in mind I have only tried the pizzas I mention below. 1. Their large pie is huge...I mean it dsn't fit the box which measures 18.5"" sq.2. I ordered different types of pies (regular,Sicilian and white). All are made authentically and consistently.3. You can taste the ingredients in the sauce (oregano, basil, garlic etc.)4. Pizza is not oily/greasy.5. They don't skimp on the mozzarella. 6. Delivery is quick(45mins.) and polite. 7. You might find a better tasting pizza close by. But for a large pie the price is on the money.Only down side would be if they raise their prices then this type of fast food will fall out of my budget and they charge tax.     ps if i can update this post i will add some pie photos....Anthony & Sal's Pizza Express you are most certainly terrific, I had a spectacular experience here today. Overall environment here is so great. Most of the menu items are incredible. Service was perfect and everybody working here was very nice and hospitable. I'm really happy that I found Anthony & Sal's Pizza Express..Pizza and heroes are good and big portion!! Definitely worth every $$$. Delivery service is always on point. Never had any issues with them and Food is good!!!.I just ordered some food there it was the worst food ever I ordered some pizza for my mom she the sauce tasted like perfume and she even throw up from it and my food was hard and I throw up too I never had no nasty food like this in my life I will never go back there.I love ordering my wings from here. It is flavorful and cooked just right. It's also not those skinny, small wings you'd get from other pizzerias.At 6:50pm placed an order of a Large Pizza with Hot Wings for delivery through GrubHub. The pizza arrived by 7:40pm which was reasonable. Overall the pizza was good, the hot wings threw me off where they are more sweet than hot. These certainly aren't your traditional hot wings where the were drenched in some type of sweeted hot sauce. The wings are simply are mediocre. Once again, the pizza is very good..Two meatballs for 2 pounds of pasta, Jesus the minimum I'd like 3 meatballs and they aren't big."
"Tasty chicken wings and pork fried rice! Their spring roll is pretty good too! If you're ever in the mood for some late night dinner for Chinese food this is a go to in Hunts Point..A big disappointment! I was working at the Hunts Point market and asked a co worker for recommendations on someplace to eat. We usually order Chinese from this one spot however they are closed so she suggested this place. What a total disappointment and waste of time and money. I ordered fried crispy chicken with beef fried rice a shrimp egg roll and a grape soda. My co worker ordered shrimp in lobster sauce with fried rice. The chicken looked weird. It was cut up in weird, small portions and they put this breading on it. The breading was tasteless and did nothing for the chicken. They seemed like they cut up a drumstick and used that in the entire plate literally. There was breading, sharp bone and NO meat. The beef fried rice was tasteless with maybe 5 strips of beef. The shrimp egg roll was the worst! No flavor with one shrimp and a bunch of cabbage, just horrible! I threw out most of the plate it was that bad! They put one soy sauce and one duck sauce in the bag; SERIOUSLY just one! My co worker had a similar experience, she didn't even eat. She took 3 bites max and just stopped. She stated that the shrimp was bad and the egg roll was worst! I truly don't know how you can mess up food this badly. I don't know how these people are even open. The flyer says 'grand opening', in my opinion they need to close, learn to cook, then reopen! An absolute waste of time and money today. There are hundreds of Chinese restaurants in NYC, do yourself a favor and avoid this place. I tipped the delivery driver $2 also, I feel like calling him and asking for it back! Yelp we need to add a zero star rating, this place is definitely deserving of NO stars. Totally upset and disappointed!.Food was not bad. Price was to high for the portion given. I assumed it would be normal sized tray so I pad the $9. When I received the food it was in a small circular tray 5"" in diameter..Very good food! I do wish they had crab rangoon instead of the, over-sweet, cheese wontons. But everything else we ordered was delicious! If you're a truck driver waiting to get loaded or unloaded, or on your break, they deliver right to your truck! You'll need to pay with cash though..This was the Chinese place where I had chinese food growing up. Never had any problems and the food is good..The worst Chinese food place ever found hair in my rice it was disgusting and the lady was so rude never again!!!"
"This is the best bar in the lower east side. It's located on a quite corner on Clinton street away from the loud and rowdy crowd west of Essex street known as ""hell's square"". The dim lighting helps create a more relaxed and casual vibe in an upscale setting. The backlit bar highlights the variety of liquor bottles on display.I noticed they had a bottle of Knob Creek bourbon which I had been willing to try. I ordered one on the rocks and it enjoyed it very much. As I scanned their inventory I also saw a variety of Vodka liqueurs. My next order was a Cosmo made with Absolut Citron, lime, and cranberry. The bartender did a great job preparing the drink because because it wasn't too sweet unlike others I've drank before. It was perfectly balanced and delicious. I definitely look forward to coming back..Decent. I had a coupon for a buy one get one drink that they didnt let me use even though it was not expired. Drinks were ok. Server was rude. I would come back if the weather was nice..We did our best to be friendly, but our server was horrid. Loved this place before COVID, will never come back..This bar is incredible if you're looking to have a chill night out with your friends. The bartenders are so incredibly nice and so inviting. Shoutout to Dillon, Lauren, Maria and Vinnie! My friends and I come here at least 2x per week - for good reason!!!JAGER BOMB BOYS.Great hot cocktails for the winter time! We had a spiked hot chocolate, rich and strong. Warm heaters at each table. The waiter was very friendly, this is my friends favorite neighborhood spot, I'm so glad I got to visit it with her!.I'm not sure why this place is always packed. I definitely won't be coming here again. I came here after work and the only thing they had on the menu was hotdogs not to mention they ""ran out"" of wine glasses. Their tables are not wiped down. It was just gross..The servers here are NOT nice! They take forever to get to you and then when they finally do decide to take your order that have the worst attitude. I'm not sure what the deal is but, these same two women are the main reason why I tell people not to come. They yelled at my friends and overall I don't ever feel comfortable coming back..Donnybrook is the ideal LES neighborhood bar! The staff is friendly, and the drinks are reasonably priced. Definitely recommend if you're in the area..I find this bar very charming. It's quaint and low-key, perfect to sit with a book and enjoy a drink near the window or to being a small group of friends at one of their large tables for some conversation. The drinks are moderately priced and they have a decent selection, which is nice. The service is always great, everyone is super friendly and fast. It's one of the better bars in the neighborhood in my opinion. I would definitely come back. 4.8/5.One of the best watering holes in the city. Maria and the rest of the staff are friendly and professional. Nothing better than nice hot toddy on a cold winters day with good ol' frank (sinatra)  being heard between the laughter and joy of your closest friends."
"Ordered 4 empanadas for less than $10! They do have a 4% service fee for using credit cards so would recommend paying cash. Always get the Biagra one (crab, scallop and shrimp) unless you have a shrimp/shellfish allergy of course! We also got the Cuban - ham and cheese, Italian sausage, and cheesesteak.Their green sauce is definitely spicier than Mama Empanadas. Will be coming back more to support mom and pop shops!.Part two of the empanada adventure.Mama's down the street did not have their masks properly on. Most of the places along Northern do have empanadas, a huge benefit to the neighborhood. So we trekked one block to this spot. We walked into Empanada Spot. The cashier had her mask under her chin and another employee was sitting in the chair closest to her did not have a mask at all. He was not eating, they were just chatting. We turned around and left with urgency. It's not worth it, not after the severity of seeing several family members pass away from COVID-19.It's been over a year, sigh. Minus 2 stars since this is still a health safety issue..Beware of Empanada Spot Jackson Heights location.  My order was inaccurate the guy at the register overcharged me for missing empanadas , when I called to their attention about the issue a woman on the phone said she would leave a memo for the person in charge to check receipt of my order.  Yet, I went back the next day to pick up my missing empanadas and the same woman the skinny one I had spoken to over the phone acted like she had no recollection about our conversation she was very rude and condescending.  However, I was able to settle my dispute , make sure you count your empanadas before leaving for take out , Empanada Spot is shady business!.I HAD THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER IN THAT RESTAURANT. PLEASE DO NOT EVER GO THERE!I went to dine in with me Service Dog, which by law it must be allowed in public places including restaurants, and the owner's son approached me in a very aggressive way asking me to leave the place because according to him they do not allow dogs in their establishment. I showed him my dog's Service Animal Certificate and ID and he insisted that they do not accepted any kind animals. I really thought that he was about to hit me because he was yelling in front of everybody making me feel humiliated. His name is SEBASTIAN  and apparently is on steroids because he does not only has the need to show off his muscles, but also he is super aggressive and rude towards customers. I ended up leaving the place and feeling very humiliated for his actions. Some other people that I know have had confrontations with SEBASTIAN because he does not know how to deal with the public. My advice: DON'T EVER GO THERE! There are so many other Colombian restaurants along Northern Boulevard..If you're looking for a great snack or even a meal, then this place should definitely be on your list to check out! I love empanadas and the huge variety of fillings it comes with! You can have a  few or have them all! You just can't go wrong with them. & the pink sauce goes well with them, you just want to keep dipping. I can't wait to go back for more!.They charged us twice, and the order wasn't correct. The lady who answers the phone is extremely rude!.Terrible service.  This was my go to place when it was still named Mama's.  I always put in big orders for work and parties.  This is the first time they messed up my order--  now with the name change or new management..whatever.  However, when I called them to let them know they didn't give me the office favorite (4 caramel empanadas) but something else, they didn't want to make it right. After arguing woth them, they said I have to come in to swap them out the SAME day.  As if I can just rush back.  They should have said come in when you can and we'll give you what you ordered. I guess I'll move to find a new empanada spot.  This place dosen't have the customer's back..That might be the single best empanada I've ever had. Those plantains were incredible as well. Can not recommend enough..I used to like this place because it was a quick place to get empanadas while having tables to sit at with good food.  It's under new management and the food has suffered. I ordered a beef empanada Baked and it was black inside when I bit into it, B-L-A-C-K.  The person attendant said that's what I ordered wouldn't give me a new one or exchange it or just kept telling me that that's what I had ordered.  Regardless of the fact that it's $1.90 he could have just helped us out by taking it off the bill or exchanging it. How can they serve to people? I'm never going back, I wish I would've taken a picture so you guys could see..Barely any meat inside. Flavor no good. Save your money, next time I'd rather eat them off the roach coach that comes by the job site."
"I really love the empanadas here. they usually pretty fresh and tasty. I guess because of inflation, they are making them smaller. The chicken and beef are really good. Same as biagra. full of seafood but now is not that big. Do not order other items because they will be stale and dry. I had a grilled chicken and is was dry and stale like when u reheat old chicken. very dissatisfied n did not get money back because I did not eat right away . If I order again it will be just the empanadas.This used to be Mamas Empanadas. They've added more items to the menu, I guess to diversify and bring more clientele.Not a fancy place. It is more like you order and take home type of joint..Has a line but she rather answer the phone first. Then when She hung up, she looks past the next customer to the following.If people are in front of you the phone can wait. Tell them to hold. Simple. Last time coming here."
"So much nostalgia walking in here! They stayed open during the pandemic and it was an easy experience. The flavors are endless and they still keep up the look they had since they opened. Classic spots for ices and ice cream in the heart of whitestone..3.5 starsRalph's is quite popular, so I decided to give it a try while I was around the neighborhood. There is a variety of different flavors, almost to the point where I had choice overload (good thing!). I tried the orange soda and vanilla combo, cherry flavor, and pina colada. They were all decent, but I didn't particularly love any of them. The main downside was that you can't do split flavors in one cup. When asking the worker which were the popular flavors, he basically lists out almost all of them haha. If I were to come back, I would try a fruity flavor..You can pick from so many options! I didn't even know where to start. Since I don't travel to queens that much I wanted to get a little bit of everything. Started off with their Ralph's sandwich. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have anymore waffles in an early afternoon. Their other options were cookie, pound cake and pancake. I went with cookies for my chocolate chip fudge ice cream. You can also heat up your Ralph's sandwich and get a drizzle on top. If you like fruity pebbles, you should try their fruity pebble milkshake. I just thought their straw was a little too thin for their milkshake. It was kind of hard drinking it. Obviously since you're at an Italian ice place, you had to order one. They have four sizes (kiddie, small, medium or large) . I tried their blue Hawaii which is basically blue raspberry and their root beer. Planning to come back here again to try more from their menu..Still great and friendly service and carrying the full array of flavors and options.  During the pandemic they are requiring masks and only allowing 2 ppl in the store at a time, which is appreciated..Ralph's has been my family's go to place to get Italian ices for years.  They are only open seasonally so every Summer we go as often as we can.  This location is small but really clean.  There's a cute little bench in front where you can sit and enjoy your purchases.  The staff is friendly and efficient.  Sometimes, I go overboard and order too many items.  This is kind of dangerous as they only take cash.  They have a huge menu and every visit I spend about five minutes looking at it.  And even though they offer a ton of options and varieties, I usually only ever order my favorites...watermelon or blood orange ices.  So delicious and refreshing.  It doesn't have that artificial taste like some Italian ices have.  Other items on the menu are milk shakes, ice cream, ice cream sandwiches, sundaes and icai bowls. They have a lot of sugar free items as well.  We love Ralph's and we'll continue to come but I have noticed that prices have steadily gone up.  Sigh, I guess that's not too surprising in NYC..The best ices in the 5 boros hands down the GOAT. Also awesome customer service 5 stars all around..Such a great friendly staff my go to is the sugar free mint chip I pretty much have one every week it's so good.I wish I lived closer to this Ralph's. I absolutely love coming here to grab something cold and delicious, especially during those really hot days during the summer.The inside has a few seats in the front but most of the place is used to store all the different flavors of flavored ice. My favorite is definitely the soft serve. It is incredibly thick and smooth. On Tuesdays, you can come with a friend and you both can get a Twister for the price of one. It's the soft serve with a water ice that you can put in the middle. It is really tasty!I also really love the strawberry cheesecake creme ice. It has chunks of actual cheesecake in it.A great place to go if you want to try different flavors of ice cream!.There are a lot of flavors and they taste good. I live close to here and the one on bell has closed so I go here more often now. I've seen the same owner for years. Better prices than pessos..Love this place ! Amazing service and selection! So happy to have this place. MaryBeth is a rockstar and the girls working there are so sweet and friendly and work quickly."

"Pleasantly surprised to hear my tongue sizzling; delivered piping hot!  Noodles lightly coated with a savory sauce and a peanut crumble.Tom yum, a spicy smolder balanced by coconut milk.A great meal, thank you Note Thai..I need to drive 1:15 to get there and this is my 4th visit, very clean,haven't really try the bar yet because I am always busy eating, so many different dishes to try , I need more time or bigger stomach !! Go See it, taste it to believe it!!!  Remember to take a lot of picture there, is very pretty..My 100th check in! Yay! Hahaha it seems to me that I'll be far from reaching elite status by the end of the year like I originally wanted to. However I can still win for it and if I fall short? I'll just kill 2016!!!   Anyhow, on my way home from a nude beach(yes, that's right) I was so hungry. Maybe it was all the flesh exposed to my tender eyes or something. So en route home I spotted this hole in the wall Thai spot and decided to stop in.   I walk in and it's literally so small it's ridiculous. 5 people will make it crowded in there. It looks like a regular Chinese spot, but they serve Thai. Oh well go figure. I ordered the Drunken Noodles(spicy) w/ chicken to go.   Upon tasting my food, it was good. Nothing to lick my fingers for, however food nevertheless. It was perfect for what I was seeking, it did the trick most of all, and exceeded my expectations. I'm giving 3 stars because there was nothing special. It was just average and although they were closing, I didn't like that they were rushing me to leave. Would I stop in for a bite again if I was driving by and was hungry? Yes. Would I get dressed and leave home to dine here? No..I am actually surprised the health department didn't shift this place down already. No one should eat from this place it's just filthy.First time eating at this place so I always order the chicken drunken noodles. It was average, the flavor wasn't bad, but it wasn't really good. The noodles were colorless.The prices was $10 but it really should be $8.50If I'm ever in the neighborhood again this wouldn't be my choice of Restaurant. I would go to another Thai..Worst Thai food my wife and I've ever had. Seriously. The food smelled like cat food, the tofu was burned in old cooking oil, the veggies not fresh, it was awful; we couldn't finish it..Good quick Thai food.... gets the job done when ur in the mood...not ideal for eating in but u can if ur in a rush .... mostly a take out place.[Originally posted 2/2016 under another account. Reposting as I'm reconciling both accounts into one.]Tiny ""hole in the wall"" place that I happened to drive by while heading back to NJ after a meeting in Brooklyn. Seats at best 3-4 people and if you're looking to eat there, probably disappointing. I will say the food was delicious, fast, and reasonable. Blew any of the Thai restaurants near me away in terms of flavor and food quality. So, if you're in the mood for Thai takeout (they also seem to deliver nearby) I would give this a full double thumbs up..I use to order from here a lot but I can't handle the inconsistency. Either they get the order wrong or the same order arrives different every time... specifically the green curry and the drunken noodle dish. My goodness. I wish I could write a better review but if I don't know how my order is going to taste each time I order the same thing, we have a problem..As far as I'm concerned, this is top-notch Thai. And that's coming from a [self-proclaimed] Thaiholic (no copyright infringement intended) and an Elite Yelper (refer to badge, pls).I don't understand why Note Thai doesn't have a higher average.Were Note Thai not in my neighborhood, it's unlikely I'd have ever sought it out, which is a shame. Excellent curry--I'm slurping up their peanut curry as we speak. Medium amount of spice, the way I like it. Perfection.Price is right, employees are always friendly.Order from here right away."
"Jeff and the entire team at Bon Soir Caterers are the real deal seasoned players. We chose them to cater our wedding at the Prospect Park Picnic House this past October over any of the other preferred caterers because of their excellent communication, glowing reviews and renowned expertise. And we wouldn't have had it any other way. From their professionalism, experience, attention to detail and warm hospitality, Jeff helped make our wedding day one of the best days of our lives. My husband is a chef and I am a caterer so we know how much hard work goes into putting together an event like this and food is incredibly important to us. Jeff's passion, humor and expertise left us feeling confident we wouldn't have to worry about a thing, and it was true. He is a gem! Their adherence to safety protocols helped make us feel very safe. Even when there were some hiccups like things not showing up on time, we had absolutely no idea because Jeff took care of everything. They really went above and beyond. The presentation, the food, the guidance in the entire planning and production of the day was made so easy because of Bon Soir. The event staff were fantastic, upbeat and professional, and if you are lucky enough to have the Bon Soir team cater your event please show your gratitude through smiles and generous tips because they truly go above and beyond. This business can be grueling work and Jeff is not only an exceptional caterer but he absolutely loves what he does and that love and care really shines through. Our wedding guests are still calling us to rave about how delicious the food was and how it was one of the best parties they have ever been to in their lives! That was one heck of a party! Thank you Bon Soir! (I don't know why Yelp is saying I'm from Atlanta? Brooklyn born and raised and we had our wedding here in Brooklyn!).We hired Bon Soir To cater Baby Shower party at our house. Everything was perfect from the start. Timely arrival, excellent presentation, delicious food, professional service! Will definitely use them again for next event..We had our wedding at the Prospect Park Boathouse. After the previous exclusive caterer went MIA, many of the couples, who were left stranded including ourselves, were invited to a tasting with Jeff and the team. We were blown away by the presentation and taste of the food. After careful considerations, we decided to go with Bon Soir and we are very glad we did! Yoriko knew the Boathouse like the back of her hands. She was one of the main reasons that we went with Bon Soir. She was calm and collected the whole night and moved things along, working with my Day-of Coordinator. The staff member were so courteous and sweet, making sure we had everything we need and we looked our best on the day. Right before I walked down the aisle, one of the servers notice my hanger string from the dress is out and helped me fix it! It meant a lot to me because I can now spot that in some of the photos I took before the ceremony and I am so thankful he noticed it and corrected it!The food was absolutely amazing. I have friends raving about crab cakes and chateaubriand for days. Everything was executed perfectly and timely to our plans and we can't thank Bon Soir enough for our beautiful wedding..Bon Soir catered a small 20 person birthday party for us. Couldn't be happier either food. We picked up the food, which was ready as promised. Their kitchen loaded the car for us.  The hot food, braised short ribs, and chicken Fran chaise was fresh, delicious and plenty full. The salad was also just as fresh. Food for 20 could feed 40. Everyone took food home. Bon Soir will cater the holidays for me this year now. Thank you to the full staff and owner.    They care and it shows..We cater our thanksgiving meal at Bon Soir this year and very disappointed with the food. The turkey was not fully cook, we see blood near the thigh area. All the side dishes were either over cooked or not cooked enough. All the good doesn't taste very good. Also they are overpriced for the kind of food they offered. Won't order from them again..Words cannot express how wonderful Jeff and the whole Bon Soir team are on every level.  Not only did Jeff help us figure out the best menu for our budget he also guided us through creating a blueprint for our entire wedding day. Jeff and the Bon Soir team are always calm, always positive, always easy to reach and always working to make sure you get exactly what you want on your big day. No question went unanswered and every question was met with never-ending patience and wisdom from the whole team. We don't know how we would have planned a wedding for 220 people without Jeff's guidance. He even helped us with wonderful suggestions for alcohol and beer vendors and helped us figure out the best amount to order which was above and beyond his call of duty for our party.  The entire staff on the day of the event made sure the party was seamless. Every staff member treated us like royalty from start to finish and they were so sweet to our guests.  And, now...the FOOD! Every single one of our guests made a point of raving about every item that was served from appetizers to entrees. Everything was fresh, hot, delicious and looked great.  Our friends and family went up for seconds and thirds and could not believe we were serving such delicious food at a party for so many people.  For example, the pita with our appetizers was served fresh and hot. When have you ever had fresh, hot pita bread at a party? We did (and so did all our guests) at our wedding. We hope to have another party just so we have an excuse to hire Jeff and his team again. If you are looking for a caterer for your big event, look no further-Taylor Williams and Danny Wolohan.I have to start this review by saying that Bon Soir was THE BEST choice my husband and I could have ever made for our Wedding. We got married in April this year at the Prospect Park Picnic House and of all the catering options they offer, Bon Soir is by far the one to go with. Jeff from Bon Soir has been in the wedding industry for many years and he knows what he's doing. When you talk to him, he will put your mind at ease and be very straight forward, explaining details of how things work and also taking away all the ""shenanigans"" from the process. We started communicating with him via email and then scheduled our in-person meeting. The meeting was great and he made my husband and I feel confident that they were the ones we wanted for our wedding. We booked our tasting and the food was beyond delicious. We were so excited with the food and he surprised us even more giving us a good portion of the generous tasting leftovers for us to take home. We loved every bite of those leftovers.As the day approached, he made sure we had all the details were sorted out and he was super quick and responsive when we had a hard time finding a Beer vendor for our wedding. I messaged him asking for advice and he immediately jumped in and gave us a great alternative. Not only he found our vendor, but he did all the due diligence to make sure everything would be fine on the wedding day, meeting with the vendor in person and making sure they were aligned before the big day.Needless to say that our wedding day went smoothly, he set up everything the way we had envisioned and the food was FABULOUS!! Everything was on point, and our guests were thrilled with the wonderful selection. From appetizers to main course, to the bartenders and waiters, everything was perfect. Him and his staff work like and great orchestra knowing exactly what to do. And I can't understate how amazing the food was. To this day, I still have guests telling me how much they enjoyed the food. Rocco and I couldn't be happier with our decision.If you're looking for a caterer for your wedding, Bon Soir is the right choice. They made our dream and vision become a reality by their professionalism, reliability, quality service and excellent food..We used Bon Soir at our Picnic House wedding (in Prospect Park) this past August. Jeff and his team have years of experience in catering, and it shows! Jeff helped us pick out our menu and the food was deeeelicious! His day-of team was incredibly helpful and was there to help us with anything we needed. Also, Bon Soir is very affordable considering the area and quality of the food!!! Thanks for making our day great!.Bon Soir was one of several caterers recommended by our wedding venue. We diligently contacted them all, deciding ultimately to go with Bon Soir because they had glowing reviews and offered the best value. We were not disappointed! The passed hors d'oeuvres were abundant--multiple people told us they started turning appetizers away towards the end of the cocktail hour because they were getting full. Very importantly, the food the day of the wedding was as good as it was at our tasting. We received so many compliments, both immediately following and nearly 2 months later. The staff working the event was obviously experienced and worked seamlessly throughout the evening. I highly recommend Bon Soir for your special events!.Jeff and his team catered our wedding at the Prospect Park Picnic House. Everything about our experience deserved this 5-star rating.Bon Soir is professional, top to bottom. They had an option for everything we hoped to have at the wedding, and if it wasn't on the menu, he made it happen or showed us how to make it happen. I'm not sure anyone can come close to beating Jeff's prices, and there are no hidden ""gotchas."" The entire process was transparent and straight forward. I saw one review citing Jeff's ""blase"" nature about his business. I would agree that communication wasn't always instant or quick, but it was if I expressed urgency. Jeff assured me all of the pieces would fall into place, and they did. Any time I had questions, he had answers. Any time we got worked up or stressed, he had a solution.On the day of we didn't have a care in the world about the event. We had an amazing maitre d and my wife and I could enjoy the event and great food Jeff's team served up. Hot tip, use a planner or coordinator for day of - saw the same review cite getting approached by the staff. Gotta have a coordinator for that exact reason.Thanks Jeff!"
"Super yummy sandwiches! This is a great place to grab lunch or dinner and feel total happiness. I recommend the ""toasted goat"" sandwich... comes with a salad and it's the perfect feel good meal. I can't wait to try all the other stuff on their menu. If you're in Ridgewood and looking for a great meal, this is the spot to try..I came here for brunch as it was my friend's birthday weekend. Ordered the toasted goat, which had a very inviting description. When I got it, I was unimpressed. The food description overstated the delivery. As with similar places, brunch in NYC has just been a cash cow and s cheap experience. One of the wait staff also had poor communication skills about an out of stock ingredient, rendering my friend's order essentially obsolete. What I liked: - outdoor seating - goat cheese and fig combinationWhat it lacked: - memorable food that matched what was marketed What it could improve: - staff communication skills and take responsibility for gaps in communication- finding ways to elevate their ingredients (felt like I could grab ingredients off the shelf of a nearby supermarket and do it myself).The Chicken potpie was absolutely amazing. I love the ""chic"" take on the potpie with the puff pastry and taste of the wine was absolutely superb. My friend had the goat cheese with bacon jam. Sooo GOOD GUYS! Its everything that I thought it would be. Julia's is a cute staple in the neighborhood. I love the decor inside. It's quaint so make sure you catch a seat by the window. There's a nice ledge to put your belongings. The cocktails are $12 which is nice considering NYC prices.I'm only taking off a star for the service. I'm not sure if they were understaffed but we kind of waited for a long time for everything. Nonetheless, I would go back!.I've returned to Julia's for brunch and have to say while the food remains good, the service is lacking. They do not take reservations, which is what it is. They are definitely busy on the weekends, and you may experience a wait. We were seated at a table and after 15 minutes no one had come near our table to take our order - drinks or anything. A waitress took the order of a table that came in at least 5 minutes after us. That was the last straw. I had to go to the bar to tell someone that we still hadn't had our order taken. They are simply understaffed. Drinks take at least 10 minutes to arrive after you order them. The music was also super loud and made hearing the people at your table difficult. Overall, a tasty bit frustrating experience..Julia's is a cute cafe and bar in Ridgewood. I went here for brunch with two friends, and we ordered a spread. Overall, the food was quite tasty. You absolutely must try the Toasted Goat. It is the best thing I have eaten in awhile. I found a few of the descriptions on the menu to be less than accurate. The arepas con huevos do not come with anything resembling a traditional arepa. It set up expectations for the dish that were not met. Still, the dish was tasty. Our only issue with anything we ate was the potatoes (I do not remember what they were called on the menu). There was too much sauce drizzle on the top. It would have been better on the side. I enjoyed the food I ate and the hipster watching at Julia's. I will definitely be back..Absolutely love this place!Came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon & it was really beautiful. We sat ourselves next to the window & they had a v cute assortment of live plants.It did take them a while for them to assist us when we first arrived, we stood at the door for a while but staff is very kind and friendly.What we ordered:Cinnamon Apple waffle -- 12/10Very soft waffle , so delicious Vegan Harvest Hash -- 9/10The dressing they coat this with is so yummy! I literally couldn't put my utensils down for a second even to take a drink.We also ordered two of their cocktails. I got the mezcal sour & it was really good! 10/10My friend got the sparking wine cocktail which was also 10/10 really great!.Second time coming here for brunch.  Very tasty and unique food. The coffee here is decent, I wish they made more unique concoctions of coffee recipes.  Something fun like that spot Nomads! I had the goat fig sandwich last time for brunch and it was amazing!! This time, I had the Cuban sandwich which was tasty but I prefer the goat sandwich if I had to pick.  The service here is good and they are very friendly.  The place itself is super small and the tables are tiny! I wish they had more comfortable chairs.  The golden lox is a very good dish as well.  Very light and flavorful.  If you like dill then you will love the golden lox dish.  Highly recommend this spot!.Very delicious cocktails. Right next to a few shops and good shopping. The bartender was very nice and chilled out with us for a bit and chatted. Felt like a really popping neighborhood brunch spot. Would return..I would rate Julia's four and a half stars.They have a great list of wines by the glass. It features a nice variety of wines. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the lost and offered some great recommendations.Interesting menu for food too with many vegetarian friendly options. I had the mushroom melt which came with a couple side salads. The sandwich had a perfect crust. I liked the creativity of the sandwich.My wife had the goat cheese melt and the pork arepas. Both were great too. The arepas were probably my favorite item.Staff was knowledgeable and attentive. Definitely a great spot for drinks and more..I've had brunch here several times, and got take out many times during the pandemic. My favorite is Arepas con Huevos with pork, it has fresh corn and just tastes amazing! I've also had the smothered toasts and pumpkin pillows, which I think are seasonal. I love the fun mimosa's like prickly pear. Great romantic atmosphere and nice decor. Will have to try their dinner sometime..I've been here for brunch 3 times and every time was delicious! First time we had the arepas con huevos with pork and the smothered toast. Both were awesome, especially the arepas. They were made fresh with corn kernels. We also got the pitcher of regular mimosas. The atmosphere is eclectic and romantic, great for a date. Second time we both had the arepas again. Then I went by myself the other day and got the pumpkin puffs, a side of bacon and the prickly pear mimosa and nothing disappointed. Pumpkin puffs were like mini muffins, I don't know what they did to the bacon, but it was awesome. I highly recommend the prickly pear mimosa, I've never had anything like it. I seriously gotta try this place for dinner sometime..Really delicious AND super affordable! I got The Old Standby (as pictured) for brunch last Sunday; soooo great! And $11 --very reasonable, and an amazing bang-for-buck ratio. Plus, great cold brew, great service, and a cool/charmingly creepy (haha) Sade painting in the bathroom (as pictured).I'm moving back to NYC next year, and I will definitely be a Julia's regular!"
"Low key - yet opulent. I mean both the setting and the quality of the food. Excellent food every time. I have been coming here for over 20 years whenever I am in town. Worth the trip up the east side and over to York Avenue for this gem. If you love great Indian food, Mumtaz is one of the best in NYC. Trendy is not their game. Excellent dining is..Best tandoori chicken I've ever had was very spicy and tasted as if it had been heavily marinated several days before roasting. The paratha bread is deeply salted butter layered and delicious. On the vegetarian side I found the Aloo Gobi tasty and plentiful, especially with all the free rice and condiments they give you. Excellent Indian food..Best Indian in Yorkville -- unassuming, yet amazing quality at a great value.Local establishment since 1970s, with write ups in the New York Times.Try the outdoor garden, or a quick takeout..Hidden gem of Yorkville. (Also has a hidden garden for outdoor dining.)Be sure to order directly from the restaurant!.Consistently very, very good food! I could live off of the Chana Shag a la carte which which is delicious AND healthy, a twosome that Is not always easy to find.The Chana Shag, a mix of chickpeas and spinach in a light curry sauce, is addictive. The portion is extremely generous and, included in the $ 11.95 price is a huge container of rice, a cup of yellow split pea dal, and a couple of chutneys. Delivered on time, it is always  as hot as if it had just been cooked. I have become a weekly customer! Thank you Mumtaz!.When I lived in the UES this was one of my go to places for Indian food. I have dined at the restaurant as well as ordered for takeout and the food has always been great. The mango lassi is sooo good!!! The chicken makhani, chicken tikka as well as tandoori chicken are all great option and the serving is a great size. The service is also great..Loved it. Charming atmosphere and very good Indian food. What's even more, the staff is friendly and very family-like. Nice place. One thing though- the ""outdoor garden"" needs a little more than just an artificial Christmas tree with some sparkly lights. Get rid of the tarp too..I've been coming here for years, back when they were on Third Ave. This is by far my favorite Indian restaurant in NYC. The food is exceptional and the customer service above and beyond.  When I come here the father and son make me and my BF feel like family. I've been here so much, when I walk in the samosa order goes in right away. They already know all the basic items that I order. Can't wait fit indoor dining to begin again.  Miss you guys..Really yummy authentic Indian food that is really tasty but doesn't feel bad to eat such as isn't oily and greasy..Best service in the area!!! Wonderful food and environment. Highly highly recommend!!!.Amazing food, quick and friendly service. Generous portions for such a good price.  Very clean space inside and the staff is amazing and super friendly. This is my new Indian spot. Should be yours too!"
"Okay, I see some really bad reviews here, but every experience is different!Atmosphere - I love the ragtag, old school Indian look. If you've been to India, this is exactly how the ""fancy"" hotel restaurants look! I love that. Service - these guys rocked! They were super attentive and really nice. Treated us to free warmed brandy/raki drinks spiced with cardamom. I plan on using that recipe come holiday season!Food - I was disappointed that they didn't have naan but their paratha made up for it. The raita was thick and creamy. The Rogan Josh with lamb was divine. A thick, hearty, tomato based with chunks of lean lamb. It had a roasted meat taste I haven't experience anywhere else but I liked it a lot! The chicken tikka masala was disappointing though. Too creamy, not enough flavor. And annoying they couldn't do a tikka masala with paneer (which is what I wanted).However, I will be going back! The manager has been there 30 years and there is love in that restaurant!Go back and try the Lamb Rogan Josh, the cucumber Raita, and the potato Paratha. It's enough for two, will cost you about $20 total and will leave a smile on your face for a long time!.Disappointing. Although the windows are lined with numerous newspaper clippings raining praises down from The New York Times gods, my experience at Mumtaz was very ho hum. Decked out in scarlet and authentic-looking decorative accents from the South Asian-inspired cutout metal grate ceiling to the shell chandeliers to the colorful wall hangings, Mumtaz was visually stimulating in a remote, New-York-City-is-not-outside-those-doors way. The seating was a bit cramped, however, which seems pretty unnecessary considering how empty the place was when I was there.The service was very quick and attentive, so that was a plus. However, the food was disappointing to say the least. The portions were small, but, then again, so were the prices, so I shouldn't complain about that. The food itself, on the other hand, was not anything to write home about. My lamb kebab was very dry, and I spent way way way too much time trying to masticate. Additionally, the rice was an unappealing short grain pilaf. I also tried to order naan for an appetizer, but they did not serve it. Instead, he said he'd bring a chapati, which he said is ""like the same thing."" Um, heads up, no, it's not. So even if the chapati is supposed to taste just like what it did (it was like a large, flat flour tortilla), my texture-attuned taste buds say he was lying about its being ""like the same thing.""When I came back out, I looked at the newspaper clippings again, and they were dated 1984 and 1977, among others. Basically, nothing in the past 20 years. Somehow, Mumtaz has stayed afloat, but I have no doubt that there are plenty of other Indian restaurants that have popped up in the area in the past 20 years that would likely dethrone Mumtaz in the eyes of these vintage reviewers..NOTE:  Based on a delivery order...I was walking the neighborhood one evening, wondering where I can get me some good Indian food that delivers.  And then I came across Mumtaz.  I think the universe was playing a cruel cruel joke on me.Really though, I should have known Yelped it first before ordering, because I wouldn't have ordered.  But I didn't, and I wasted $25 for a mediocre lunch :-/The delivery was nice though, and the lunch was really $21 and change, but hey...round up for tip right?I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, with an order of poori and a mango lassi.  The mango lassi is still sitting in the fridge right now, I hope it's decent.The Chicken Tikka Masala was definitely not what I was expecting.  Sure the color was right, and the chicken perfectly tender....but the sauce?  Pretty bland.  And I can't recall veggies in Chicken Tikka Masala, veggies as in slices of tomato and green peppers.  Also for a $14 order...there wasn't much chicken to go around.The poori was pretty tough...not fluffy or light (not sure if light is the best way to described deep fried puffed bread).  It was rather chewy.  Not really to my liking.So still on the lookout for decent Indian food in the area.  I think I have 2 more places to try out.  But rest assured, I'll Yelp them before I give them a call..This wasn't the worst Indian food that I've had. It wasn't very good either. We ordered the poori, mushroom ""shag"", which came with some dal. The poori was good, warm and flaky. The dal was too salty, the entree was mediocre, as was the rice.I expected better from this nicely decorated place with rave reviews from the new york times. Then of course, like all of you, we noticed they were circa 1977. The servers were quick. Our food came a little too quick if you ask me. I don't know how long it was sitting around before it made its way to our plates. The servers started clearing before we even finished. Even after telling them we weren't finished on two occasions they started taking away everything. Maybe they didn't hear us. Regardless of any of this, I expect better from a NY Indian place, there are undoubtedly so many good ones. How can they keep up?.Don't get sucked in. The aroma of curry wafting up and down the street (thanks to a kitchen exhaust vent above the canopy) which draws you to the review covered door which will probably close the deal and get you to go in. But look closer, 10+ yr old Daily news food reviews don't really cut it.  Once inside the place is nice enough but the total Indian cliche; Indian themed tapestries on the walls and ceiling and red everything. The menu is basically the standard neighborhood Indian fare, masala, curry, biryani, dal. But strangely some standards are just missing like nan?!?! The quality is average at best, unappetizing at worst. On one visit the chicken tikka masala was fine but the poppadoms were greasy outside and somehow dry inside. On another visit the chicken was grizzly. Service is a bit gruff, seeming somewhat offended and disinterested after we wouldn't order a drink. I've given them two chances, they don't get a third..I go out for Indian food at least once a week. I'd never been to any place in the UES so I chose the one closest to the train.Service was very quick, but I was the only customer at 4 pm on a Saturday. Ordered the chana shag for main course. Came with yellow daal. Not tasty at all. The rice was bland. The whole thing had this weird burnt taste to it. I'm sure there is a better Indian place in the neighborhood..Satisfying late lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  Very fast!Speed:  Awesome.  We needed to eat fast, and without any pushing or prying they got us in and out in 40 minutes, plenty of extra time to catch my bus back to Boston.  Most restaurants slow way down in the early evening, so this was a pleasant surprise for me.Decor and Atmosphere:  Disappointing.  Two of us nearly walked out after seeing the inside of this place.  Dark, small, and cold, the room felt like a coffin (and we had just spent the afternoon in the underground Transit Museum).Food:  Acceptable.  I am not an Indian Food expert, but I was happy with the Shrimp Masala, Sandyha was happy with her eggplant dish, and Tim was happy with his Chicken Tandoori Masala.  Keep in mind we were all very hungry and in a hurry.  B-.Ok, so I used to really like this place.  I lived right around the corner and ordered from it all the time.  I usually got the biryani which was always tasty and the occasional lamb vindaloo or chicken tikka.  I've never actually gone inside since I lived so close, somehow it just didn't make any sense, so I can't vouch for the atmosphere.  Anyway, one time I ordered it my biryani came with a dead roach inside!  And I didn't find it until I was half way through the meal!  Needless to say I was completely grossed out and never ordered from the place again.  It was sad to see a good source of quick and cheap Indian food go but there is no way I'm taking another chance after a discovery like that....Take your business somewehere else - the food was inedible - the biryani was sweet (i have never heard of that). If you look at the ratings given to them by the newspaper which they have posted on the windows as well as reproduced on the menus, they are from 1977. Some food critic needs to write a recent review. The only 1 start is for the free dahl which was good, and the tapestry decorations."
"I came here for a quick bite and the food was fresh and delicious! I have ordered (take out) from here and been disappointed due to what I received. Tip: Do not order out from here... go dine in person-- you will not be disappointed!.If you want to go somewhere to sit down and do hookah then this spot is great but don't go for the food . After the place we originally wanted to eat at closed early, we decided on this place for the mofongo. As soon as we walked up we saw the staff at a table all doing hookah and it took them a minute to notice us. This is during the covid time so we were seated outside as inside dining is not an option. My husband and I were taken to a two-chair table at the end away from the other patrons which I thought was weird. I requested a different table and the waitress reluctantly took us to another table that seated 4 people. After we were looking over the menu a man which I will assume was the manager wearing a different colored shirt but it was the same uniform as the waitresses told us that we had to move because it was about to be their busy time and we couldn't be occupying a four person table. So we moved again. We sat down again and were given menus by a different waitress who was much more polite than the first one. We ordered 2 sprites, cheese empanada trio, shrimp and cheese mofongo, and an order of maduros (sweet plantains). The sprites arrived and were served with the can and a glass of ice each. The sprites were both flat and tasted very close to water. The cheese empanada trio came shortly after about 5 minutes and I was excited to try them since I was very hungry but they left a lot to be desired. The cheese empanadas were not too hot and they arrived cut in half with a mayo ketchup dipping sauce and a sauce drizzled on the plate that resembled chocolate but wasn't. My husband tasted it and said it definitely wasn't chocolate. The cheese inside of the empanadas looked like Polly-o string cheese chopped up or some other imitation cheese that did not melt very well. The cheese and shrimp mofongos arrived about 5 minutes after that and it was delicious! I was surprised after the empanadas. There was a lot of sauce and a lot of the jumbo shrimp. There was fried cheese weirdly stacked on top of the mofongo. The mofongo has absolutely no shrimp or cheese inside the mofongo but the shrimp sauce was really good and the fried cheese tasted alright. I thought the side dish of maduros would arrive at the same time as the mofongo and I asked the waitress about it and she said ""it's coming"". 20 minutes later we were almost completely finished with the mofongo and still no maduros so I told the waitress, ""At this point don't bring out the maduros"" she told me ""it's coming"" again and walked away. She came back about 5 minutes later with the maduros. In all, service sucked and if it wasn't for the mofongo I would rate the food 0 stars..I purchased a groupon for Albertos Mofongo the deal was for two people it included 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 drinks. A friend and I decided to visit on a Thursday night around 7:30PM. Though we were seated quickly no one attended to us for about 20minutes.When we finally received our food we noticed how big the portions were which is always a plus. We would have been okay with 1 order of rice and beans since there was so much food,The food was great everything was cooked perfectly, I loved the churassco definitely a must try !If you are in a rush this probably isn't the place to go but if you have some time and don't mind waiting the food is definitely worth it. They do have a full course bar, but our sangrias pretty much tasted like juice so ill pass on the drinks unless you order a beer..You can't go wrong with authentic Dominican food! The food is literally always good, but the service here is TERRRRRRRRRRIBLE. Make sure to confirm your order a couple times before you place it. Late night the waitresses are in their own world. Great spot for a late night quick stop... but don't expect much out of your stay;you're better of taking it to go :/.Food always so dried out and sad looking. The staff is incredibly rude...unless you are Dominican. So sad- you would think under the current political climate, we could all be a little kinder to each other. Gave them one shot. I won't be back..During Thanksgiving break, while visiting my wife's parents in Manhattan, we decided to go to The Cloisters.  It was a cold and windy day, so a warm lunch was in order after walking down the hill through Fort Tryon Park.  Not wanting McDonald's or one of the random sports bars in the area, we decided on Albert's Mofongo -- we both like Latin American food in general, and it was literally across the street from the subway station we needed to get back home afterward.As we walked in the front door, I thought that the place seemed small but mildly elegant.  At the back stood a rather substantial buffet with a wide variety of meats, vegetables, rice, soups, plantains, etc., for $14.  We decided to try the buffet since it looked so good.  I am not a huge fan of buffets myself since you never really know how long the food has been sitting there or who had sneezed all over it before you arrived.  But this one looked really good.  To my dismay, and despite the fact that we even spoke Spanish to them, we were seated in the back room of the restaurant closest to the buffet, away from other customers in the nice part of the restaurant, and next to the kitchen door.  Were they trying to hide us from the other customers?  Were they hoping we'd just eat a plate or two and then leave quickly?  I have no idea.  But there were several open tables in the nicer area, and we were shoved into the less nice, dirtier, area with surgery-room bright lights and waiters crossing back and forth from the kitchen.Also, to my dismay, the meat and vegetable dishes on the buffet were not hot at all, and some of the meat was rather tough and grisly.   In general, the food had a good taste, especially the plantains, but the heat and texture lacked much to be desired.  The place is obviously popular because several people came and went while we were there, some filling to-go boxes and Tupperware with food from the buffet.  But I have to say that, to me, it was nothing special.  $14 for room temperature meat, vegetables, and rice is ridiculous; being shoved into the back corner as if we were leppers is downright rude.Would I go back?  I do make it to this part of Manhattan once a year or so, and it's always nice to have a good go-to place that you like and trust.  Unfortunately, this is not it.  If you're in the area and have a place to stay with a microwave, or if you live in that area, then getting the food to go and reheating it at home might be worth it from time to time.  But for my money, I'll go elsewhere when I'm in the area..Best place ever if you worship the worst service in the world!!!. Going to restaurant to order a drink. All the servants ignore me. One person saw me said I should wear a mask properly. I looked at her and she's not even wearing a fucking mask. This place needs to shut down so a new place with much better service can flourish. Plus who the fucks goes to a restaurant that has less than 3 stars reviews on yelp?.This must be the WORST breakfast I have ever had...... Apart that it was $40 for horrible uneatable food the order was missing items and when I called to say something they gave me attitude. We had to throw the food away ( the home fries were NOT home fries they taste like soggy potatoes that were left in vinegar or something. The omelette was disgusting to say the least). Don't order from this place......I am honestly shocked that this place has less than 3 stars. This is our 4th time here and everything has been great. Granted, service can be a little slow but when the food comes out, you understand that it is worth the wait. Our servers have been great, charming, and down to earth. One is even super classy and her sway is inspiring! Her name is Julie! Anyway, I digress. The food has been on point since day one! The mofongo is flavorful and the texture is great! Never too soft nor too hard, just right!  I don't want to think that it's been luck because even my husband is in love. From their breakfast to lunch and dinner. Seriously, great. Of course not good for us but still delicious... don't judge us!!! Yes, the layout is weird and it isn't the prettiest spot but the food. Omg the food. Anyway, la comida es riquísima! The ambiance is very ""back home"" kind of place, at least for me. I'm Puerto Rican so I love the latinividad in this place. And it's also a sports bar so sports fan can enjoy their baseball basketball and football!   Ok let's talk about their drinks. STRONG! And me likey it! And you will too! If you're in Dyckman try them out. If you have to wait a little, I hope that you experience their charm and warmth. I'm new to this neighborhood and they can tell but not once have I felt like an outsider, nobody here does and you can tell. Shoutout to Albert's Mofongo!.This place used to he great, now it's a shit show. No more buffet as the waitress told us.Items on the menu you can't orderThe bread that they put on the table we had to pick it up since nobody got us any. 35 minutes later they got us a round.0 water even when we askedTables are wobbly and we had to put stuff on them to fix it.Asked for water and they got bottle water nut never ever mentioned until they came with it.We ran out of bread by now and the water just came (minute 38) ps bread should not je reheated on the microwave it gets elastic and hard.A fly around the food..Now to the food:THE food that needs to be cooked on the spot aka not the one that's already on the buffet style area ( I know there is no more buffet according to the waitress ) that's good.Get the pricey mofongos and always ask for chicharron  or pork inside as that's how they are supposed to be made. I got the chivo mofongo and all they do is mash the plantains and give u a side of goat?. I was wtf it should be inside of the plantains.The fried stuff was also good. Do not get the burgers.The fish was also decent tilapia style fish.The service got better as a guy came to help the girl that was clueless and I think she was not trained well on how to treat customers.Spent 490 dollars for good food and shit service. Last time mofongo house, last time."
"This place has the NICEST, FRIENDLIEST, PROFESSIONAL staff !!! As soon as we walked in we were greeted with smiles and the vibe was very warm. The desserts were delicious. We shared a Cinnamon Toast Crunch boozy milkshake that I highly recommend, and cinnamon beignets! The atmosphere is a club vibe with dim lights and music playing. It was low enough to have a conversation with was awesome. The place was clean and you would think you were in a high class lounge in Manhattan. I'm definitely returning !.I had a great experience at Confections Dessert Lounge & Bar. The mood is lovely. Everything tasted fresh and was fantastic! Team ensured every thing was o. k. Great location, nice atmosphere will be back soon..This place has all the makings of a trendy late night spot for dessert, but it has a few areas it can improve upon. Pros: The staff was very welcoming even though it was late into the night, so it was nice to see they are not looking to turn people away when its empty toward closing time. We also loved the mix of music they played as the playlist bounced back and forth from early 90s hip-hop to 2005 pop radio hits. Our party of 6 ordered two desserts to share, one being the smores dip. Everyone gobbled this up. It is a marshmallow, chocolate and bacon dip with graham crackers serving as your chips. Cons: We were the only group there and one of our dessert orders was not submitted into the kitchen so we just told them not to worry about it. They were very apologetic, and it was not a big deal, but I guess just be sure to have them read back the order to confirm you will receive everything. We also ordered a Cinnafflebun Sundae and this fell flat. The waffle was doughy and undercooked. I think this place will do well because its on the south shore and its trendy so guarantee they've found the right spot to pull in a crowd. I do love the concept as when its late and you want to satisfy that sweet tooth, this is a nice place to sit and hang out..Private Event:I would first like to start off by saying that their customer service is amazing. I must've called/emailed/contacted at least 10 places before this and it was like pulling teeth. Confections, on the other hand, was extremely receptive to my inquiries and got back to me within minutes. Jamie made herself avaliable to speak to me about catering options/packages. The very next day I had a meeting with her to see the venue (super cute). The package prices are very reasonable and come with a large selection of food to choose from. My event isn't until a few months from now, but I will be sure to update my review. In the meantime, I am very pleased with my experience and am excited to work with them..Had a great time last night at Confections Dessert Lounge. I went out for dinner near by and decided to stop by and check the place out. I got there around 8:00 pm and there was live music. Jeff Lubin & Denny Blake playing contemporary rock tunes on acoustic guitar. They sounded great!!!. I decided to sample some alcoholic beverages. I had a Manhattan, a Smoked Old Fashioned, and another that I let the bartender make for me (I forget what he called it). All of the drinks tasted great. I ended the night with some coffee which also tasted pretty good. I look forward to going back and next time having some dessert..Know that excitement adults get when they're heading to Disney? That's what I get when I go to this place. Ambiance superb, the desert and desert drinks are unbelievable - salivating right now thinking about it - the crowd just right, and the owner awesome. I can't wait to go back and enjoy their delicacies and music..This the first time I have used this app....I cant believe that the manager (didnt even get her name and she didnt even bother to look at the notes the hostess wrote down about the party) of the place wont have a private party on a friday night after 9pm for over a 150 people that arent teenagers and that would have been an open bar so they would have made a lot of revenue plus free publicity for the place...we went there on a sat nite and there was only 10 people including the staff around 1030pm ...the hostess that night was so sweet and nice...it would have been a great place for a party oh well your loss keep serving those 3 to 4 couple that you will be getting on a friday nite and write the reviews that the people will be line up to get into her place...Good Luck!.This the first time I have used this app....I cant believe that the manager (didnt even get her name and she didnt even bother to look at the notes the hostess wrote down about the party) of the place wont have a private party on a friday night after 9pm for over a 150 people that arent teenagers and that would have been an open bar so they would have made a lot of revenue plus free publicity for the place...we went there on a sat nite and there was only 10 people including the staff around 1030pm ...the hostess that night was so sweet and nice...it would have been a great place for a party oh well your loss keep serving those 3 to 4 couple that you will be getting on a friday nite and write the reviews that the people will be line up to get into her place...Good Luck!.Over priced.  Over rated .! I can make better anything then this. I was expecting this to be restaurants Quality desert. All I got was raw in the middle Cinnabon and they fucked up my order . They brought me a nasty grilled cheese , I ordered a BLT. Incompetent as well.! Don't waste your time or your money you will be  disappointed.I have been here a couple of times.  First I want to say that the staff is ULTRA friendly, helpful and quick.  The owner is awesome.  The place is super clean.  I have been to their Drag Queen Bingo Brunch.  OMG so so much fun.  Well worth the $50 charge, which includes the Drag show, unlimited drink of the morning, Brunch, which was delicious, your Bingo card, DJ and prizes.  The Confections Dolls are awesome and so personable.  They make you feel like you are their friends.  Especially Michelle Pinata and Jazel Jazalien.  Love those girls.  I have had a few desserts and a couple of drinks and what I did have was delicious.  Looks like a great date night place too..Came here on Valentine's day. This is definitely a great date spot. The dim lighting, black leather benches, and live music make it a real staten island gem. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I didn't like my espresso martini and they took it back and even took it off of my bill. It's not that it wasnt good, I'm just not much of an espresso lover. I thought that it was going to be like a chocolate martini...my bad. The candy BLT was my favorite. Its served on big thick bread so I shared it with my hubby, and the duo that sings the live  music were exceptional! The only cons that I would add are that it takes a while to get your drink, which I don't mind but some might, and the specialty drink menu is not really impressive. They could have a few more creative drinks on the menu, being that it is a bar lounge that doesn't have an extensive food menu. Definitely a great late night hang out spot if I'm ever on the south shore late at night."
"I thought I had a review for this place a while back, but I guess not so I shall pay my tribute to this place now. If you are looking for a good sushi spot in Downtown Brooklyn, then look no further than this place. Very traditional Japanese atmosphere and the wait staff are great!The food itself is fresh, creative, and an art itself as the presentation of the food served are all Instagram worthy. The food is served on fancy plates, garnished, and have those crazy art drawings they do with the sauce. It is reasonably priced around $16 per se. I've been coming here for about 2 years now and I look forward to coming here every time I want to get sushi.Edit: Apparently this place is now closed...so sad to see it go. RIP..Really cool atmosphere and amazing food!! This place reminds me of a cozy izakaya, and the food is so good in every aspect: it came very quickly, the presentation was beautiful, and it tasted great! We got the beef and unagi don and each came with a plethora of tiny sides. The sushi rolls we're of good size and tasted amazing. We also got the special drinks (non-alcoholic) and they were very delicious!The service was very good and the wait staff checked up on us regularly. Would come back again!.Came here on the suggestion of a friend. Honestly, if they hadn't suggested it, I probably would have passed it a million times before going in. It's tucked into a corner you'd think were more appropriate for another business.Jun has a poor selection of special rolls, but a great selection of sake. I really wanted to have the omakase. I never pass up a chance for omakase when it's on the menu. Unfortunately I couldn't have it. The waitress said they weren't doing it that day. Not sure why that was the case, but oh well. Maybe another time? We had the chef's pick 5 and hoped for the best. I was pleasantly surprised when it came. It looked beautiful and was really really good. Check out the picture attached. The entire thing has a lot of variety and is quite filling as well.Give Jun a chance if you're looking for a chill spot to enjoy some sake and sushi..This is definitely a nice, small cozy restaurant. It is perfect for a date night which you can actually have a conversation. The service was good. We got the five chef selection, braised pork, salmon fried rice and salmon avocado roll. The five was delicious. It was fresh. I love the salmon avocado roll. I like how they put mint leaf on it which gave it a refreshing kick. The braised pork is a must get. The soup base was delicious. The pork was fat and juicy. The salmon fried rice was different than what I had in mind. It was special of the day. When I took a bit, it reminded me of rice cake. The rice is fried in a square and top w salmon. This dish was ok. Overall, I enjoyed every last bite in this restaurant. I came here a second time. This time I got the poke and yuzu shrimps. The yuzu shrimps were very crispy and rich in yuzu flavor. The poke was very fresh. It would've been better if the poke was marinated for a little longer to allow the flavor to soak in..This is definitely a nice, small cozy restaurant.

Since this place is new, I got a bunch of my coworkers to visit tonight. This is a small cozy place. The staff greeted us warmly and was patient in answering any questions we had. We got a variety of things from fried shrimp to soups to fish cakes to a variety of rolls to bigger plates to desserts. I will highlight a few that stood out. Kimchi Salmon Roll was surprisingly not that spicy. This is the closest to ""spicy salmon roll"" that I would get from a low end Japanese place. I was concerned that kimchi would be too spicy, but this was just the right kick. I would totally order this again. Spicy Scallop Roll was not as spicy as I had thought and the scallop pieces were soft and tender. This is a must get if you also want to come for their lunch roll special. Grilled Miso Black Cod was the single thing that I was looking forward to. It was buttery tender and generally made well. I wish it was marinated in miso a little bit more so that the miso flavor would be stronger, but this is definitely not bad at all. There are a quite a bit of bones in the two pieces of filet so you should be careful in eating it. Even though I didn't try it, the grilled miso salmon looked equally as appetizing as the black cod. Matcha Mousse was simple but a nice end to a great meal. It caught my eye as soon as I looked at the menu and this didn't disappoint. It's on the sweeter side, so if you don't like your dessert overly sweet, then don't get this one. I'm looking forward to coming here for lunch and trying their chirashi don! This is a solid hidden gem that I hope it is here to stay!.My first time visit.Japanese style set meal restaurant.Quality: 5 stars. There were some traditional set meals and I ordered lunch A, Grilled mackerel. Good taste and my memory in Japan came up to my mind. My colleague ordered Chirashi sushi （assorted sashimi donburi）and he said it was also delicious. Price: 4 stars. Lunch A was $13 and Chirashi was $16. Not bad taking quality and rareness into consideration.Atmosphere: 4 stars. Japanese Izakaya style and felt in a Japanese diner. I like! Staff: 4 stars. Not bad. Quick, polite and accurate. A little bit business like.Cleaness: 5 stars. Cosy and clean.Totally, I recommend you to go this resaurant if you want to go to a good Japanese diner..Favorite sushi in downtown Brooklyn! A quick and easy no frills sushi bar, that has a few interesting rolls. I'd like the Salmon-Tuna roll that has lotus chips of top, and the salmon sandwich with Shiso leaves. Those and others are unique takes on sushi with fresh fish and other unexpected flavors. The shisito peppers and salmon appetizers are also fun. Go with a few friends so you can taste a few of the rolls and apps! Also, if you like them on instagram before you pay and show them your phone they'll give you 10% off your check!.A new place in downtown Brooklyn to try. Started with the fried wings and squid appertizer to try it was something new had half fried and the other half grilled.  The unagi don set is awesome for 17.00 is worth it. Love how they have tempura eel and tamago eel added to the set to give ones an adventure to try 3 different style of with the eel. The Omakse set the fishes are so fresh. The servers did a good job of helping put some of the food we couldnt finish in a smaller plates so we can have room for the entrees..Had a great Sunday night sushi meal here. The restaurant is tucked away in a relatively quiet corner of downtown Brooklyn a bit far from the main Fulton shopping area and closer to the Metrotech complex. It was quiet and we were seated immediately. The interior is small but pleasant and comfortable. We had two sushi special rolls, a hamachi and a spicy tuna. Both were great, and we followed them up with an omakase order. The Omakase presentation was really quite something and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The rolls and nigiri included were all fresh and tasty..Third time here. Small place and limited selection of sushi. But we came here coz it's near our home. We ordered dragon rolls from today special , taste great and there are fish eggs inside which is my favorite. And tuna and salmon rolls, not good as the previous one. But the service is good, always aware of what you will need."
"I'll be honest - I wasn't expecting this place to be amazing. I was staying at the hotel around the corner, and didn't want to go too far for lunch before heading to the airport. The front desk recommended this place, and I am so glad that they did - WOW.My wife had ramen and it was rich, delicious and a solid amount of food. We shared the spicy fried chicken which was both delicious and spicy. I was in more of a sushi mood, and while most places that do soup and sushi tend to delivery mediocrity on at least one Menya Jiro killed it. The quality of the fish was fantastic, and the presentation of the rolls shows they are confident in their quality (no cream cheese or fluff). For ~$7 a roll these were a slamming deal, and that sentiment applied to the experience as a whole.Don't sleep on this spot because it delivers on every level - amazing food, great prices and overall good service. A must visit, even if you've gotta go an extra subway stop or two!.This is by far one of the worst ramen places I have been in NYC. I had their Ibusuki ramen. The broth was watered down and was lacking on the flavor. The Ajitama was overcooked :( ... The noodles were good consistency. Overall I would give the ramen bowl 1.5 stars. I also ordered spicy tuna sushi which was meh (I know I know, not the place to order sushi, but just wanted to eat a terrible sushi that day). The place was not packed when we go there. I think there were like 4 other parties. They had only one person who worked as a waiter/ and was taking online/phone/pick up orders. The guy was clearly overworked and not blaming him. But we kept having to remind him of our order items. They also  have an offer where if you check in on yelp, you would get free ice cream. We asked for the offer. They said it is still going, but we didn't get the ice cream even after we asked a second time. So we just left without the ice cream. There are many better ramen spots in the area that you should try instead :).All you need to know. Broth is excellent. Both the light and rich types. No edamame on the menu; didn't ask if they have it.The thin noodles are great, and just the correct softness.The cha-shu is way too lean and/or tough. This is one driver of my rating.You don't need to pay a tip, but they increased the listed menu price per serving. For instance, ramen is $17.50, egg is +2.50, etc. This is another reason for my rating.They require COVID vax proof.You both order and pay using your phone..Tried their ramen at Japan Fes (held in Chelsea this year). Quite disappointing. Got four little ramen ($12) each with about 4 bites of ramen in each. Every bowl tasted quite different, 3 watered down, 1 quite tasty, 2 with way too much raw onion, etc. If this is what a sample of their ramen tastes like, I would be afraid to try the ramen in the restaurant. Gyoza was okay, inconsistent but good flavor and texture. Ramen was also lukewarm in the 2-3 minutes it took to find a place to eat it..Vaccine Update: As of 8/18 when I went they require you to show vaccination cards if you want to sit inside. You are able to sit outside if you do not show card. The food came very quick, the aroma of the soup base steaming was amazing. I ordered the Sukrajima which is denoted as spicy. The spice was okay. The noodles had a good texture and it was slurped up deliciously. The meat was definitely the highlight of the dish. It was extremely tender, deeply flavored and made me wanting more. I would have given 5 stars if the portions were a bit more bang for the buck, and if the spiciness was a bit more hot to my liking. Great ramen place and I enjoyed my meal here!.Kagoshima - $17.00 (only ramen, bean sprouts, and broth.)Add ons - Soft boiled egg ($2.50), Age Gyoza ($4.50), extra noodles ($3.50), extra cha shu ($3.50), fish cake ($3.00), tofu nuggets ($3.50), and grilled cha shu ($3.50).Spam Rice Ball - $5.00Japanese Fried Chicken - $9.50Pork Bun - $5.00Total - $60.50 (Yeah.....)My rating is solely on the ramen and not the side dishes. If you would like to know what I give the side dishes, I'll add it as a side note in the end.This is my first time having Kagoshima style ramen. Second day of having another ramen from the Kyushu Region of Japan. Ideally, ramen should already have the cha shu, egg, menma, nori, and scallions with the noodles but in the case of this place, you need to purchase them as add ons. I will reevaluate my rating once I've researched and tried this ramen from Kagoshima myself. Broth - 3/5. Clean, yet delicious and tasty. Lacking the creaminess and heaviness that I'm craving for in a ramen. This is perfect for those who wants to eat a healthier and lighter version of tonkotsu ramen.Cha shu- 3/5. Pulled pork. Tough chew, quite lean and not even fat.Noodles - 5/5. Thick noodles. The way I like it. Besides the fact I ordered a lot, as you can see in my last photos, a lot of the food was left uneaten and bought home. I believe this is the first time I ever left the cha shu untouched in a ramen. For me, this place is average. There was the ""Ibusuki"" ramen with richer broth I have my eyes on, but we'll see...Side dishes:Karaage - Thumbs down. While the pieces were big and juicy, it was quite bland. They didn't know seven spices and I make it better at home.Pork buns - Thumbs down. It's the pulled pork that caught me off guard. I prefer the thinly sliced fatty pieces of cha shu than the pulled pork.Spam onigiri - Thumbs down. It's actually an oversized musubi. While the thick layer of rice was new, I would skip this..It's not that special. It's pretty basic and not cheap.$27 for lunch for an appetizer, Ramen and tea..Great food and customer service. Cute date night or after work hangout with coworkers. The staff is great and will answer any and all questions you may have..Great food and customer service. Cute date night or after work hangout with coworkers. The staff is great and will answer any and all questions you may have..It's been a while since I had good Ramen and this place disappointed me a bit. I must say my son swore this was the best he ever had but for me it was just basic. The broth was decent but the noodles were still a little tough for me. I ended up taking it home and cooking it more. Our fried aged gyoza delicious The sweet and spicy chicken chunks just weren't good. It didn't even look like chicken when I cut into it. The place is small but social distance was enforced as much as possible..My husband is obsessed with this place after coming a few times so we decided to stop by for early dinner one day. I really appreciate the way they bring your utensils in a wooden box and you can order & pay via iPad to simplify the process and keep everyone safe. Friend got the unagi don, I had the spicy ramen and my husband ordered rolls. Lots of noodles in my bowl, not too spicy (spicy by japanese standards tho). Edamame and takoyaki were great starters. It was super empty for a weekend evening."
"I went over this weekend to see a movie premiere and was sooo surprised by the design and layout of the theaters. The entrances to many of the theathers had very unique entrances. The theather was so clean and spacious. I was able to get to my theater without any issues, it was easy to find. I went to get food before the movie started. The line wasn't long but was a little confusing as there were 2 line entrances and when it was my turn someone from the other line went ahead. Didn't understand how the lines worked but it wasn't much of a problem as the staff was very efficient and nice. They were able to answer some of my questions about the food as I had ordered a kids meal (which was around $7)I also went to the restroom and it was nice and clean, though some of the si ks were wet all around but I blame the other customers and not the staff as not everyone is the cleanest. Overall, if i am near the area wanting to watch a movie i will most definitely go to this theater as it was visibly amazing to look at..12-31-2021Yes a thousand times over!!! Eye orgasmic, sound blasting, clarity so real you can feel it! Spider-Man:No way home blew me away the first time I watched in Vegas in an AMC Dolby Theater in Town Square. My second viewing in NYC on an IMAX screen seven stories high is so stupendously outstanding! I would literally pay for a flight just to feel this movie going experience again and again! I cannot say much for the service as there is a pandemic we are up against and staffing must be limited but the quality of sound and cinema is definitely an experience I will remember as long as I live! I shall return!.First time to this theater and upon entry was pretty satisfied.   Got into the premier line for concessions which there was only one person attending to a line of at least 15 deep.  Odd as the regular line had three people along with others behind the scenes helping to grab stuff that was ordered.  We waited for 20 minutes before they finally added two additional people for assisting the premier line which of course went fast.  We got tickets for Spiderman and sat in the balcony area.  First time experiencing such a unique theater.  We had seats in row L #3 & 4.  Not too bad only downside was the railing.  Both the catch at the end of the balcony and the divider for the stairs.  So, the bottom left portion of the screen was interrupted.  Keep that note in case you are looking for balcony seats, the middle ones will be your best bet for uninterrupted views.  Overall, I thought the theater was fine, minus the slow action taken at the concession stand..I saw Black Widow here over the summer on a weekend during the afternoon and had a good experience. The theaters here are quite spacious however there's only one level of sitting. In other words, all sitting is on one plateau as opposed to having to travel up a series of steps to get to the back of the theater.If you're in the area, I recommend stopping by to see a movie in your spare time. The lines are never long during the day. I haven't been here post covid vaccine mandates but I'm pretty sure it's required that you present your vaccine card prior to purchasing a ticket..AMC Lincoln Center is one of those theaters that really should be better than it is. Located in the ideal neighborhood deserving of a renovated, majestic grand theater, which judging by some of its larger auditoriums it once was.  Instead, what this upscale neighborhood gets is a theater that is long overdue for a make over, with only a few cinemas that have been upgraded to recliner seating and the majority of theaters -- especially those showing independent films -- with the most uncomfortable seats of any movie house in the city. Staff is friendly. What this location has going for it is that is one of the few AMV's to show the small, indie films. And that's a big plus. But the uncomfortable seats and dingy auditoriums takes away from the latter..The iMax theater was great. to be quite honest, I am used to New Yorker's even though I am originally from accross the Atlantic but I told the concession gentleman I would like a regular popcorn. Granted I don't know the prices, so he brings me a TUB of popped corn and I saw excuse me I am so sorry but I did ask for a regular size.. his response was ""Well, you paid for it""..A really nice looking multiplex with solid individual theaters.  Seats could definitely use and upgrade, though..A wonderful movie theater. Got to see Macbeth with a Q&A afterwards featuring Frances McDormand and Joel Coen. The iMax theater is an experience unlike any other. The other theaters are also great - truly a fantastic place for any movie lover. They also host tons of premieres and events. This place is like Disneyland for film geeks..Like most movie theaters in Manhattan, it's pretty vertical. I will say they have a pretty impressive IMAX screen..Why AMC is selling all tickets in theaters and not leaving spaces? I saw Respect opening night and it was packed, a person in every single seat. It was pretty uncomfortable, and didn't seem to even be in one of the bigger auditoriums. Many people were sitting in other peoples seats, it was a pretty bad experience."
"I have passed by this particular restaurant on many occasions.And last week was my first time. Soon as I walked in I was greeted by a nice lady who worked there. She took my order, first stew chicken and peas and rice,plantains. I didn't wait long at all.The order was only $7.00 for a really nice portion of food.some other restaurant charge you more for less ,or the give you less meat and more of every thing else. The staff was nice ,and the atmosphere was relaxed. Plus the restaurant was clean, I would definitely go back there in the future ..I didn't have to travel all the way to the ave to get my saltfish because they serve it all day as long as they have it. I had a craving that needed to be tamed. I've purchased many lunch specials for $5 whenever I'm in St. Albans. The only downside is that they don't serve saltfish separately you have to get it with a side. I opted for rice and peas. It was worth it. The saltfish was seasoned well and had a decent amount of peppers. The rice and peas was very flavorful even without any gravy on it. I was served two measly pieces of plantains. I was a bit annoyed about that..Was in the neighborhood and decided to try this spot out. I was surprised at noon they still have breakfast. I ordered callalo with salt fish. I walked out and checked my bag and realized she only gave me callalo. I went back in the restaurant and let the lady know. She went ahead and opened the container took out some of the callalo and put it back in the pot and put salt fish in the container. That is so unsanitary!!! I never in my life witness something so unsanitary. Not to mention the lady's attitude was horrible like it was my fault that SHE made the mistake!!! I will not be returning back to this establishment after this experience. I can only imagine what other unsanitary things that's been done..This place is really close to me so I get a 5$ chicken meal when I need something fast. The service is cool and slow to medium of they have one person. The stew chicken,fried chicken,curry is good.The veggie patty is delicious. The best I've had in a while.Coming from Brooklyn I've had better chicken but they do a pretty good job..Great food! I'm obsessed with this place, its not fancy but like I said, the food is good and the service is too. I love going to a business where the workers are kind and professional. Prices are good as well. My son is a picky eater and usually doesn't eat rice or chicken, but he loves it when I buy it from here."
"This is one of the best spots to come for unlimited brunch in the summer. If you are looking for a great party atmosphere with a group of friends, definitely check this spot out. I normally don't care for unlimited brunches as I feel they food isn't great but that's not the case here. I actually enjoy their food. The only downfall is their brunch menu is quite limited.I suggest the breakfast burrito for brunch!It looks like they also have a great dinner deal that I want to take advantage of in the future. ( Bottomless Dinner: (Thurs - Sun starting at 6pm) - $65/p + tax and tip - 2 hours unlimited well drinks, wine, and/or beer. 5 tapas per table served family style)4.4/5.Happening brunch place in New York City is packed if you come late and mimosas is good. Had the lobster Mac & cheese with burger so good.Cool music and perfect for get together with friends.I'd say the rating here on Yelp is pretty spot on -- for me this was a 3.5 star experience but I'm bumping it to 4 as the drinks made up for the food. First, you should know that nearly everyone is here for bottomless booze. It is LOUD - I'm talking screaming at the top of your lungs loud - and music is blasting (good music tho). We were initially seated by the door and it was freezing out, so the staff kindly moved us to a table in the back where it was much more comfortable. Our drinks were good - I got the vodka soda which was quite strong! The sangria went down smoothly as well. Unfortunately, the food was not as good:1. BBQ chicken sliders - 1/5. Cold, bland, maybe 2 ingredients between the buns. Chicken was dry. Avoid.2. Truffle mushroom croquettes - 5/5. Best tapas we got! Great texture and flavor.3. Mac and cheese - 4/5. Decent flavor but seemed a bit old (like it had been sitting out).4. Chips and guacamole - 2/5. Bland, avocado seemed old. Basically just mashed avocado and could have even been store bought for all I know. 5. Elote Salad - 3.5/5. OK flavor and the lettuce was soggy.I wouldn't return unless I intended to black out for a friend's birthday, lol. Worth trying for a day/night out, but you've been warned about the food....Felt like a nightclub inside, especially their downstairs area! Very dark and the music was very loud. Definitely a popular spot for a girls brunch, make reservations ahead of time. Got the bottomless brunch, which includes unlimited sangria, mimosa, and bloody mary plus an entree of your choice. The mimosa was really good, they served it in huge champagne bottles! The sangria and bloody mary were alright in comparison. The truffle mac and cheese was so good, definitely a must get! Portion size is huge too. It was such a fun atmosphere, the music was 10/10 and everyone seated downstairs vibing and singing to the music! Only complaint is that the place felt a bit grimy and the bathrooms were dirty and cramped. Great waiter service though!.Ordered: Bottomless Brunch (~$47/person): includes unlimited mimosa, bloody mary, red or white sangria along with your entrée.Steak Egg & Cheese Sandwich (entrée): 2 scrambled eggs, steak, 3 cheese blend, with poblano sauce served on Amy's french hero served with house potatoes and greensAya's take: oh, we outside!? You know us New Yorkers love our boozy brunch. Poco is great because it can accommodate for large groups like my party of 8! 20% tip already included for large parties. Drinks kept coming and music was pretty good. Food was average, but a place like Poco is more for the vibe..We did a group brunch here on a Sunday and enjoyed ourselves. The music had a nice little ""turn up"" vibe to it and the food was good. I ordered the french toast with a side of bacon and enjoyed it. Service was satisfactory. The drinks aren't anything special but they do what they need to do lol..Poco was a party! We did the bottomless brunch! It comes with bottomless mimosas, Bloody Mary, and wine. You can mix and match drinks in the bottomless. It includes one entree as well. It is really busy so I would strongly recommend making a reservations in advance. We got lucky and grabbed two seats at the bar. Food- we ordered Guacamole to start, it's fresh and chunky which is my preference always.  French toast- my God, all French toast is. It created equally and this is by far the best French toast I have ever had, hands down. The texture was perfect, but honestly stop reading the review right here and order it lol. I added a side of eggs and bacon the bacon was perfectly cooked!  Crispy but not burnt. The bottomless mimosas flow ok, so get something hearty because they keep them coming. Tatiana was our bartender and she was awesome. The staff was also really fun and upbeat! Loved the energy. Vaccination cards are required- I don't think they require masks inside..Brunch here was a little bit of a disappointment. Came with 12 people and we sat at a long table in the lower level. It took about 45 minutes to get our drinks started. Wouldn't have been so much of an issue, except the hostess kicked us out of our table right at 6 pm for another group. The food was all decent. Fun vibes and good music. I would definitely try to sit upstairs..Bottles at Bottomless!My first and favorite bottomless experience! I've been to 50+ bottomless brunches, and this is the only place where we served BOTTLES of mimosas-they definitely set the expectations high! We ordered the lobster rolls and smoked BBQ rolls, but who really comes to bottomless for the food? I'm not sure if that particular day was special, so hopefully they still serve bottles.Not to mention, the waitstaff was amazing, and overall vibes were immaculate. Just don't forget to bring cash, or you'll pay a small card processing fee :).Waited 15 mins to get greeted by the server, waited 30 mins for our waters to come. It's was very loud so it's so hard to hear Any1. We had 7ppl and the servers only took half of our orders and left. Left the other half waiting, then forgot our drink orders. Our rvsp was at 1:30pm and it's 2:15pm now and still waiting mg for the 1st drink. Not sure if there's enough servers but I see a bunch of runners / buser. The server was standing behind the bar the entire time. Seems like it's overly crowded and everyone is just waiting around for refill since they promote the unlimited boozy brunch & dinner with a. Time limits of 1.5 hours but we're basically waiting around the entire time. Plus, you can't substitute the menu, I asked for steak and salad + egg w/o the potatoes and bread and they said no. So I just ordered the steak sandwich. Let's see how it taste. The good was basic. They cut our 1.5 hour boozy brunch earlier & we told the manager that they took 30 mins to get our drink order. So the manager gave us 1 more drink and that's it. Kind of disappointed as the other tables that was there before us was still here drinking and they told us our time was up. Don't think I'll be coming back again: it's more of a boozy spot with bad service and basic food."
"I was only here to escape the Canadians across the street.  Really though, there was a packed Canada Day party happening over at Mama Bar and it just got to be a bit much for us.    Like many, we spilled across the street and ended up at SB3.  We somehow scored a few seats at the bar and I was delighted with the bartender.  The place being sorta fancy (fancier than me - not that THAT is saying much, but still...), the bartender was a bit unusual.  He was kinda, I don't know, a hefty white guy wearing a weed t-shirt and wiping sweat off his goatee.    Given the crowd from the party across the street, he was mad busy, but was still delightful.  He even went back to the kitchen and washed up a pint glass for my can of Guinness.  That's sweet.He was also very very generous with the wine portions for my companions.  When the folks in the seats in the open window moved, we jumped in them.  We spent another hour enjoying the midnight air.The place isn't really my scene, so I doubt I'll return, but I'm still thankful that it was there as a reprieve from the wall-to-wall crowd of poutine- and LaBatts-addled Canucks!Oh Canada!.During the summer, SB3 opens up into the street and is a great place to have a few drinks with a date or hang out with some friends.  For the usual NYC price, the drinks are good--well made, so they're strong but still taste as mixed-drinks should!  The atmosphere is laid back and sophisticated.  There are some high tables with backed barstools and a few low tables with couches for lounging.  My first time at SB3 was late on a Sunday night and the bartender made us some amazing drinks that weren't on the menu.  The choice of music was a little off putting--the combination of the atmosphere and jazz made is seem like the place was trying too hard.    One woman (who I assumed to be a manager) made us a drink but acted really pretentious.  I left with the impression of a nice, well put together spot that was little full of itself.  The next time I stopped by with a few friends after some dinner at Mama's Food Shop (good God those helpings!).  This time the good drinks were supplemented by some really funky/cool music, and our waiter was attentive and friendly.  Maybe the place is better on busier nights.  In the end, a nice place to hang out and have some drinks...with a memorable name to boot ;).My experience at this bar can be summed up in one word: odd.There was a vampire working the door.  He had fangs and rings on each finger that had talons coming out of them.That's not the weird part.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.Me and Alli ordered some cocktails.  Our waiter was very friendly and attentive.  The owner, I presume that's who he was, stopped by a few times too.  2 out of 3 of the cocktails were delicious.  Yay for the Pomegranate Gimlet and Lemon Ginger Mojito.  Nay for the Mental Ward, some kind of gross whiskey drink.Somewhere between the Mojito and the Mental Ward and listening to ""I like to move it, move it"" playing from what must have been a mix CD? we noticed an eastern Euro woman with a short spikey hairdo walking in and out of the bar. Suddenly she reappeared with her gentleman friend who was dressed in a bright orange t-shirt tucked into matching bright orange pants.  Not only was he dressed in one of the loudest outfits I've seen in the East Village (and that's saying a lot), he was holding a giant cat on a leash.  I was no longer in a bar.  I was on the set of the latest Austin Powers movie. The two of them headed downstairs, an ominous place where colored lights were spinning around and spilling into the stairwell near where we were sitting.  As if on cue, six young dudes with faux-hawks appeared and immediately went downstairs.So now we have an eastern Euro woman, a man dressed completely in orange, a gigantic cat on a leash and six guys with faux-hawks down in the basement.Did I go downstairs?  Heck no!  I could only imagine the situation playing out down there.  I'm all for being alternative, but the scene at this bar was beyond bizarre.  Even for me..So now that I've opened my own store and don't have to be at work until noon, I can do things like go to east village bars after midnight on weekdays and see what the kids are up to when all the office workers are tucked in for the night. Let's take a closer look, shall we? I arrive at SB3 to meet a friend and we go downstairs to get a drink. There's a minuscule dance floor complete with disco ball, hipsters shuffling around to old school hip hop, girls trying to score with the bartender, girls trying to score coke and a man burrowing his face in a bar stool. Upon closer inspection, I see that there is a ginormous cat on a leash sitting there. Being an animal lover, I immediately gravitate towards the cat and as I pet it, his owner leans in and explains: ""I'm gay, but my cat loves fucking women!!!!"" Me: ""Pardon? Your cat loves fucking women?"" Him: ""He fucking loves women! You know what I mean."" Me: ""Clearly."" I continue on with my drink, vacillating between thinking that this place is totally awful and kind of awesome at the same time. Then one of the DJ's comes up to me and kisses me on the cheek. He is not your normal, east village DJ. This guy looks like a vampire straight out of Blade, dressed in a black suit, black dress shoes, black sunglasses, full length silver finger adornments and authentic fucking fangs where teeth should be. You can't make this shit up. Then he says to me, ""I'm in love with you."" Mind you, I am uncharacteristically prepped out, wearing a raw silk plaid tank top, rolled jeans and reef flip flops. You couldn't dream up a more mismatched couple. So I reply coyly, ""You don't even know me."" He says, ""I don't need to know you.""  Shortly thereafter he returns, eyes me up and down and says, ""if there were whipped cream, we'd be in trouble."" Really!  So all it would take was a can of whipped cream and we'd be going at it, procreating and making preppie vampire babies??? Right. Actually, preppie vampire babies would probably grow up and dominate the world. Perhaps I will give this a second thought..someone once told me SB stood for Sexy Bitches and 3 - well there's 3 of them?that seems pretty accurate.however, upon further contemplation...i realized it was because it Sucks and is on B and 3rd.creative.bwaaaah.the downstairs is a loungy scumhole turned dance floor.i stick to the upstairs - good breeze, not as crowded, better booze selection.weird crowd. a hodge podge of new east villagers 'roughing it' on ave. B.overpriced.i'd avoid it if i were you, but i'm not, so you might have to learn the hard way..I love this Local place.  Great Drinks and bar food, and the bar staff is always so friendly..S = So.  B = Blah.  3 = number of minutes you should stay.  SB3 plays The Backstreet Boys and Bryan Adams and offers drinks starting at $12.  The bartender offered rare drinks of vodka infused with tea and threw in an egg white here and there, which was cool, but some of the drinks on the menu weren't available.  If you're in the LES yearning for an oddly named drink, pop in.  Otherwise, don't waste the long walk.  Oh, and I think management stole their curtains from my grandmother's old apartment..Fantastic cocktails and great casual chic atmosphere. Can't say much for the food since only one person in my group ate anything. The big problem was service. It took over 30-45 minutes for my group to get our first round of drinks. We were a large group (10) and all wanted the fancy stuff but c'mon. We also headed to the downstairs lounge, which was nice enough, but none of the servers knew how to turn the sound system on. For awhile there it felt like a junior high party in someone's basement with no music and no drinks, until one of my friends figured out that you have to press ""play."" The staff was very nice, though obviously inexperienced, and things picked up once another mixologist arrived. He even made up a special shot for the group. The owners were very friendly but obviously stressed out. Hopefully service will improve soon. I'm rooting for them."
"Very Old Fashion, but.......We need a little of that stuff now more than ever. The menu is really satisfying and you will not be disappointed.  Go with someone you love  and you will not be disappointed. The biggest surprise was the price which we were really Shocked at how reasonable the meal was. My wife and I have lived in Tribeca for 45 yrs. Enjoy.I was in New York for the third time , and this time for my birthday , and I can say that this is the meal I was in search of . The ambiance is lovely , uplit arches something like the gaudi viaduct . The service was exceptional . Attentive , prompt , silent where preferred , engaging where desired. The wine list is robust and they had a fabulous selection of amarone. Prix fixe with the determines 3 antipasti were lovely and balanced  but maybe a tad  rushed . This was made up with the proper primi and entrees . Pacing was great , presentation was flawless and taste was so magnificently balanced . We had the pappardelle  with the veal and pork shank and orange ... which was exquisitely finished .  I really can't describe the perfect finish and balance . My wife's gnocchi melted in our mouths in the literal sense  the flavors were great.For entrees she has the scallops with prosciutto and a sauce I'm convinced that was served to Odysseus with the sirens . I had the duck with potatoes that, while a side dish , were perfectly complimentary and exceptional in and of themselves . The duck was perfectly cut and the fat expertly reduced . The sauce was a tad sweet but still great . Apple tart and a flourless chocolate cake for dessert with a pistachio gelato that would make you cry . Overall , this is what I wanted out of my New York trip and got it . Highly recommend ..We joined Scalini Fedeli for Valentine's day. They were quite busy, and we had to wait around 10 minutes for our table, which they profusely apologized for, and provided us with complimentary prosecco. Once we sat down, we understood why they were so busy - the service was excellent, the wine list extensive, and the courses all above average to superb. It was a wonderful experience, and we will certainly be back!.I have worked in many restaurant's in NYC, and I have dined in many more. I was recommended Scalini Fedeli by the Concierge at our hotel. I had asked for reservations at The River Cafe, but it was booked. My husband and I are glad that we dined here instead. Taking food, service, decor and cost into consideration I'll put Scalini at the top of my list in NYC. Scalini occupies the old Bouley space, and it is as beautiful as I remembered. Our Captain, a mature man, was very polite and very solicitous. My husband and I dine in Italian restaurants frequently, but the kitchen at Scalini excelled in ways that others don't. The highlights of the evening were Porcini Ravioli in Black Truffle sauce. Pork Chop San Domenico, and warm flourless Chocolate Cake with Pistacchio and Amarena Cherry. Very delicious!.High prices (I think I spent about $300 + tip) but excellent restaurant! The food is fantastic and the staff is attentive. Sometimes they have a special for the evening but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu..We forgot we were in NYC.  The restaurant is quiet, soft, comfortable and intimate.  The staff professional.   It has a Michelin rating feel about it.  The service was well paced... the meals appropriately portioned.... you won't walk away hungry.  The gnocchi was pillow-like in its softness, the shrimp was unique and elegant, the duck was flavorful.  The pre fixe format was simple and filled with a few nice surprises.  Scalini Fedeli is intentional fine dining..Best Italian restaurant in NYC. Have yet to be anything other than blown away by each of the 20+ courses I've tried here over the years. I will continue to advocate for and support Scalini Fedeli!.Fantastic!! I've been here twice and every piece of food I've had has been delicious. And the service and ambiance are amazing too. A NYC gem..Excellent service and foodThe doughnut dessert wasn't my favorite but the chocolate and raspberry was superb.  Very very quiet place, candlelight which I had to blow out bc it messes w my eyes but true Italian cuisine downtown. Felt like I was in Tuscany.Had a wonderful dinner at Scalini Fedeli on a busy Friday night. Both pastas that we had for our first course, the linguine carbonara and the butternut agnolotti, were excellent. For our entrees, the mushroom and black truffle crusted Arctic char was prepared nicely and about the only dish that didn't blow us away, though still good, was the duck breast. Our terrific waiter Piero (who was very helpful and entertaining) recommended the chocolate torte and the chocolate soufflé for dessert and he was spot on - both were great.Overall, great food in a classy, traditional atmosphere."
"Much better location than the last location I tried. I got seated and was served fairly fast. This location was very clean as well. IHOP like Dennys varies from location to location. I got a good meal for a fair price..20min and not one waiter came to our table. Not even to offer water. Place is usually packed and the service is on point. Today the effort was just not there.Going past the food (which is always on point) I want to write this review for the staff.We came on a Saturday morning which is considered one of the busiest times. We were quickly seated and given above average service. Our waitress took her time and listened to all the adjustments. We sat right next to the kitchen and it was quiet. The staff was very coordinated. Highly recommend!.Don't know why the score is as low as it is. Probably the whiners won because they were more diligent. Either way, food was as expected sugary and high in calories with a laid back diner feel. No complaints, IHOP on northern did well..Tasteless hamburger, the meat was gray. Very loud music made conversation impossible. Very disappointing.We came here for brunch and they have a nicely built outdoor seating. I usually go for the pancakes and omelette here but I wanted to try something different. I had the Tilapia with extra broccoli and a pancake on the side (I couldn't finish it so I had it packed for take out). They are very generous with their portion. It might be a personal preference but I would have liked my fish seasoned more. The server was nice and gave me a balsamic vinaigrette for my broccoli. Note: They don't serve any salad at the moment. All drinks are served in a disposable plastic cups and all utensils are packaged and disposable as well for Covid precautions..Lol. 5 stars???   Your eyes deceive you not.  I haven't been to an IHOP in 10 years, but friends lured me with a $6 menu from 2-10pm.  Well their steak burger rivals restaurants that serve $14 burgers.  You can get wfries or onion rings or 2pancakes with that.  Theres fried chicken burger and 4 other choices. All for $6!   Not just cheap but actually really good.  Service was great and social distanced tables. Theres outdoor seating w heaters too. We're going back to try the other $6 menu items!  Next time I'll take pics!.It says Closed but that is only because Yahoo wants them to pay to verify listing! OPEN 7 Days a Week 365 Days a Year 7am - (Call store for closing hours as they change depending on state regulations) 718-353-5576 You can order online through our APP or for delivery use UberEats, DoorDash or Postmates. Flushing IHOP values every customer and would like to thank you  for the continued support in hard times. #nystrong.Very disappointing experience yesterday! After a long awaited chance to get back to eat at one of our favorite family hangout, we experienced a very disappointing day! My food came out lukewarm, so much so that the butter on the pancake it came out with refused to melt. Even my husband's chicken fried steak came out hot but extremely hard. The only saving grace were the eggs which were done right. I immediately told my husband ""never again ""..I definitely have some issues with this place.Going at 8ish pm and they close at 10pm. You'd think the service would be good because the restaurant was not busy and there were only 3 other tables waiting plus us. We waited a lot time to order drinks. Then waited again longer to order food. Then waited for food for a long time. when I mean a long time I mean at least 15-20 mins between each. I didn't expect that at all.The food was okay nothing to be excited about. I was expecting it to be like other IHops but nope. If it wasn't for wanting to try their Halloween pancakes I would go elsewhere. My real gripe is why is my hash brown square shaped. Hash browns are supposed to be cooked a bit sloppy to give it that shredded look and that was not the case and it tasted horrible.I'm not sure if I want to give it a second chance..Good that I didn't read reviews before coming here. If I would I could miss it. Now IHOP is not a restaurant that try to be perfect. For the same experience I would give a restaurant that charge you a fortune 3.5 stars. But I know IHOP, and I know what they offer. And for the price they charge you here, and for size of portions. And for service (that some here consider a 1 star service), I give them 5 stars. Group of 5 and we all had great time here. And I have an uncle that I think that last time was the first time I saw him full. lol. I don't think there is someone who never been to a IHOP. And if you ask me, queens location worth a visit."
"This place is so sweet severely underrated! I was expecting mediocre food but I got delicious, fresh and flavorful instead!!I ordered a piece of salmon toro nigiri, a yellowtail toro nigiri and then I did a make your own poke bowl ($17).Both of the nigiri's were delicious, I wish I ordered more and the poke bowl (spicy salmon and spicy yellowtail) was so flavorful, I couldn't get over it! Definitely recommend the chipotle mayo sauce and the fruity ponzu! This will definitely be my go-to poke spot in the UES..Made a order though Uber Eats, realized it was for pick up in a location more than 5miles from me. I called them it LESS than one minute and told them not to make it b/c I'm going to cancel it via Uber eats. Only to find out Uber eats doesn't have customer service, than getting a notification less than 5 minutes saying my food is ready.so even though i called them to notify them that it was a order i was going to cancel, they went ahead and made it, not giving us time to get in contact with Uber. I specifically told them i was unable to pick it up and i didn't want to food. Why did they make it, i honestly don't know.  They kept saying i have to cancel via Uber, which i understand, but why would they continue making the food i don't understand. them making the food is not going to help me in my case to Uber to get money back, so i placed an order for 69 poke bowls under Mr. Potato head and sure enough they called to make sure it was a legit order before they processed with making it. so when i call to cancel my order less then one minute from when order is placed they couldn't help me out, and decided to make the food knowing nobody was going to pick it up. That didn't matter because they got paid. but if i want place a ridiculous order with the intent to pay when i get their, they want to call and make sue they are getting paid. so now I'm stuck paying for imaginary food, when they couldn't just left that order unfulfilled in order to help me out. I'll be waiting with a champagne bottle when this place shuts down, even though i don't drink. it's nice to live in a first world country where food waste is just an everyday thing. So cheers to you poke fresh, doing things the American way..Solid! Volcano Roll and Crazy Tuna Roll. Not the best tuna filling I've had, but still delish. Great attention to textures. Fresh. Quickly delivered. I'm holding back a star simply because this was not the BEST sushi I've had, but I truly enjoyed it. I'd love to order again..I saw some questionable reviews for this place but thought I'd give it a try anyway and now I wish I hadn't. I had to pick out the salmon because it tasted so bland and some pieces were darker than others making it seem like some were less fresh or something. Super expensive for a very disappointing poke..They are only for pickups now. I picked up a crab poke bowl and it was probably one of the best! Sauce was really good, and went really well with the crabs. I love the hint of cilantro too..We ordered two custom made bowls for dinner. Both the bowls had spicy tuna and spicy salmon. The fish tasted stale. My fiancé and I felt sick after finishing our bowls. Please do not order from this place unless you want to get sick!!!!.Super fast delivery. I had vegetarian rolls and a bubble tea. Good prices and good quality. Would order again!.Seriously these poke bowls are huge and so delicious. Fair price for all that you get! I can eat a lot and can't even finish a full poke bowl. I recommend shrimp and salmon with the chipotle Mayo and fruit salsa!!.My bowl had so much sauce to cover up the stale fish. I paid $17 for my bowl and I've had better from $10 Poke. I feel kind of sick after eating a small bite..Ordered this through GrubHub. Meal arrived within 20 mins. I was not impressed by a few things... 1. Please chop the cilantro2. Please do not serve expired uni 3. Please don't serve cheap chopsticks4. A min of 3 napkins should be provided.5. Iceberg lettuce as a filler is a no, no. So the uni that I added extra to my poke bowl was not only expired, but tasted and smelled like fecal matter. This is very dangerous as I could have gotten violently ill had I eaten it. You can even see from my pic that it's not even the correct color or state. I had to remove most of everything in the bowl as the taste/smell infiltrated most of the ingredients. The cilantro was just pulled from the stem and not chopped. Really doesn't help releasing the flavors properly and it makes it odd to eat especially if you don't provide a knife for me to break it down. My chopsticks were very cheap. They broke after I had separated them and prepared to use them. I've never seen weak thin cheap chopsticks in my life. I was given 1 napkin, one. Smh... then under the salad, there was at least 2 cupful of iceberg to make the salad look bigger than what it was. For $25 I need it all to be spring mix. I will never order from here due to their negligence and low quality."
"I ordered for the Lunch Special-2 rolls, for the first time today and thought it was great! The spicy tuna and spicy kani rolls were fresh and delicious. The special came with a nice size salad and two spring rolls. I will definitely order from here again, and it replaced my usual go-to spots for sushi. I had it delivered, was slightly over the 30-45 minute wait time--but it was a far delivery. The food was so good, well worth it..Hospitality is awfulWaitresses are not well coming.nevertry it again.The quality of foods are not good ,too greasy.I feel sick after it..Ordered their vegetable dumplings and vegetable spring rolls through Seamless and threw both out.On their menu, they claim that they make the dumplings from scratch daily, but they turned out to be a pile of 5 green prefrozen generic gyoza stuck together because it seemed that they dumped them- when still frozen- into a bowl and heated them up without separation them, causing them to be a watery lukewarm lump when I received them. The spring rolls were a soggy tasteless mess, and both food items were much more expensive than some of the other restaurants that had been selling them on Seamless.Nope, nope, nope. Will not go here or order again from here at all..Worst place and customer service ever!!I placed my order and it took 55min before arriving, the shumai were totally cold then I asked for spicy tuna crunch and it wasn't that at all.. When I called them to ask for a change the girl on the phone started  laughing and said ""we are busy what you want me to tell you!?"" I told her to keep her attitude and they lose a customer, if they keep this kind of services and attitude they are not going to be busy for too long! It was my second time ordering at this place the first time wasn't great but I gave another shot and it was worst ! Not it's over You have so much better asian restaurant around!.This was terrible.   We tried delivery.  Half of the order was missing, and they refused to send it or refund it.  They sent the wrong items of what they did send.  The food was not hot and it was bland.  Avoid this.  They were rude and had the worst service.BAD FOOD, BAD SERVICE.WORST DELIVERY..I truly loveee their lunch menu. It's by far the best deal in the upper east side. I'm not looking for the best lunch meal so saving a quick buck is always a plus for me (: Their lunch combo is about $12 for 3 rolls, miso soup and 2 spring rolls! That's definitely a bang for your buck... at least that's how they advertise it on their site. So what happens when they forget to include your spring roll? or what happens when they forgot the second and third time??? Spring roll isn't so expensive, but it sucks when someone ""fogets"" the same food all the time- it makes me think that this is done intentionally so the restaurant can save that extra few cents. the reason I ordered here is so I can get my spring roll on. otherwise i can order else where......I am an Asian and this is the absolute worst Asian food I have ever eaten and the worst service ever... We ordered 4 different dishes but all came in the same sauce. Everything was super bland and even the simplest noodles and fried rice had no taste whatsoever. This place cheated us with the bill at the end and when we asked about our bill, the lady pretended she didn't understand and didn't wanna listen. For sure will never return to this place and will never, ever recommend eating at a place like this..This is my favorite place for sushi take out on the upper east side! They have the BEST lunch specials that come with soup and a spring roll.  The lunch specials that I've had (sushi, salmon teriyaki, chicken teriyaki) are delicious and inexensive (even less expensive if you order directly through the restaurant).The thing that keeps me coming back are the vegetarian sushi rolls.  They're not overpriced like other restaurants -- just $4.  Have you ever tried a peanut avocado roll? If not, then you're missing out! I appreciate the creative rolls on the menu -- I've tried the banana tempura roll and the goat cheese salmon roll and found them both to my liking. I'm still exploring the menu, but I'm confident that I'll continue to find great things.  This concludes my review of Aba Asian Fusion Cuisine.  Now, go and order yourself a peanut avocado roll, please!.This place is extremely delicious. I have ordered from here multiple times and the consistency and quality of their food is fabulous. Top 5 favorite places to order from. Thank you!.I don't know where to start but we had a horrible experience here. First of all, the food was awful. The Shrimp with Honey Walnuts was disappointing. It was way too sweet. They put the same sauce for that dish as they did for the General Tso Chicken (which we ordered too but was just OK). They were are supposed to put tarter sauce which is appropriate for shrimp/shrimp dishes. The Tom Yam Soup was the worst Tom Yam Soup I have ever tasted in my life. After one bite, I stopped. The Szechuan Wonton Noodles was a joke! I ordered a Mango Shrimp Cocktail thinking that it was some kind of special Sushi when it was listed under the Sushi section of the menu. It was just ordinary shrimp and it was too sweet. The Dan Dan Noodles was also a joke and it tasted like they doused peanut sauce all over it and making it too sweet. The Basil Cumin Lamb and the Young Chow Fried Rice was decent at best. The veggie dishes we ordered were the Homemade Veggie Dumplings, Lo Mein Veggie Noodles and the Veggie Basil Delight Chicken were just as disappointing. Secondly, my wife bought a Groupon for FOUR people which INCLUDED beer and/or wine but the restaurant put on the bill that our Groupon only covered TWO people and told us that it did NOT include beer and/or wine which was totally false (I will not use that word which is explicit and will violate Yelp's terms of writing reviews). They only told us that it only covered nonalcoholic beverages like soft drinks which is a total farce! My wife had no time to argue the bill with them because we had a tired 5 year old to take home. We even ordered the Kung Pao Triple Crown dish and it NEVER came out and yet they CHARGED us anyways!!! They are a bunch of crooks who cheated us on the bill! When I tipped them very little as they deserved, they had the audacity to question my not so generous tip. They said something about service charge and I did not understand them due to their broken English. I asked them ""do you have a service charge""? They said ""no"" so I left it as is. If they said they did put a service charge, I would have happily taken off the tip :D I do not tip well when I have a negative experience. No business has a right to question a customer about why they tip very little or even tip at all. A lot of their dishes were so sweet that I think I became a diabetic LOL! Avoid this place at all costs. You won't leave very happy."
"When I go to the movies with mom in Sheepshead Bay, we almost always stop by at this Dunkin.I'm a DD Perks member so it's nice to share all the freebies with mom( her favorite is the Iced Mocha Coolatta  with whip cream).This DD is clean, spacious and the staff is friendly.You can always find a table to sit, eat and people watch.However, during the summer, seating becomes a bit hairy and sometimes there can be slightly rough crowd which the store need to handle a bit better.So if you want to grab s cup of Joe before or after the movie, this DD is a good place to stop..Little small Dunkin' Donuts. Looks like a hole in the wall type of spot. I walked over on my lunch break to grab an iced tea and possibly use the restroom. Unfortunately, there was no restroom in sight. I was so distraught. I really had to go. There was no other place in the area to use one. There were a few people in the store but definitely not many. I went up to the counter, ordered and got my iced tea immediately..I got food poisoning from is location.The guy doesn't understand English and charged my card wrongfully.This is insane.Avoid this location.Don't waste your fine and money! This is why I don't go to these places. False advertisement. There is no coffee in any of these fancy names empty calorie drinks. The workers only speak their language and that to me is rude. I asked about the latte and worker didn't explain to me what it was. My friend got a frozen chocolate that was a sweet brain freeze drink. Foam is extra cream is extra. They are out of their minds with add on prices. Don't waste your time get an interpreter..Great coffee. Very good service!! Very nice staff!I come by here every morning on my way to work. I'm in and out in w few mins and I'm n my way. They also have a parking lot..I seriously love this place ! The service is great, the staff is amazing, they make the food so that their customers enjoy it. All the other dunkin donuts I have been to are just so rude and the way they make their food is like they don't care for their customers. All the staff at this place are super friendly! Thank you for always making my experience good !.There is one lady who works here, basically every time I've gone to this location she really looks and acts like she hates her job and is very slow and constantly gossiping. I've also seen their donuts look pretty old at like 6:00am so not great. But convenient if it's the only thing around. I'd rather get donuts at 7-Eleven down the block or something..There's usually parking in the lot. The service is quick and the coffee is made very well. There's wifi the location is clean and there is a nice amount of room to sit - though it is smaller than most Dunkin donuts.The place is ok the workers is bad one female with her children they did not let the kid to use the bathroom it is shameful.Super slow service. Can't get things right. They don't know what they're doing. Very unprofessional."
"3.5 stars Beef and broccoli is still good, but L did not care for the chicken or was it beef?? in garlic sauce. He's had better near his workplace. Not as greasy as other fast food Chinese restaurants so that's a plus. Lo mein is okay. Orange chicken is also not bad, but it's nowhere close to the real thing. Orange beef in Flushing is just so damn good! The egg roll is good, the skin is not as thick; it's small like a traditional spring roll..3.5 stars It's true.. like the other reviewer said, this place has the best fast food Chinese in this area. Not that I've tried too many in Jamaica but I've probably been to at least 3-4 other and this place was better in comparison. I've only tried a couple of items so far and L gets his usual beef and broccoli. It's actually not oily at all. Other places, there is usually a pool of oil on top, on the bottom.. not at Panda.. sorry no Pandas either, but who would be that cruel to eat one! The broccoli is cooked perfectly. Who likes soggy veggies??! Their beef is cut slightly thicker but that's not really an issue. I did however order roast pork a few weeks ago and instead of receiving the appetizer portion, the lady assumed I wanted the entree version. Not the freshest meat, but we didn't get sick. So make sure they know exactly what you want especially if there's similar items on the menu. Their fried rice is more flavorful than the average but a tad too salty for me. Staff is not very talkative, but the service is quick and they kinda know who ordered what when customers come to pick up their food..If I could give negative stars I would. The food is good. HOWEVER I FOUND A DAMN SCREW IN MY FOOD !!!!! I ordered wings, shrimp broccoli and fried rice. Had it delivered for lunch. I didn't eat it all so later when I went to finish it I found this n my food. I was horrified. N when I called them they could not even understand what I was saying. Just kept asking for my order n address. Last order I place !!!!!!!! Will also call DOH..""This place has horrible customer service. They are rude. They never say ""hello"" or ""how can I help you"" or ""thank you"".  Her greeting is ""what do you want"" as if she is talking to a dog.  The African American  community spends a lot of money there and they should be a little nicer and more appreciative.   I'm going to make sure that everyone records their bad customer service and posts it Facebook.  Maybe we will boycott this place for a week or two."
"Los frijoles más deliciosos que jamás he comido!!!I decided to swing by for Colombian food this afternoon, and I made one of the best food decisions so far. After seeing how huge the portions were I looked through the menu and saw a ""Mini Bandeja Paisa"", but there was nothing absolutely mini about it. It was huge. The meat was super tender, sausage very good, Chicharrón super crispy and warm, avocado just right and my egg had yolk and finally the beans oh god. orgasmic!!!The total was $10.50 and I couldn't even finish the whole plate.The ladies behind the counter were extremely nice..I have come here various times for different small bakery items. I have tried the pan de Bono, the empanadas, pound cake and chocolate cake as well. Everything is usually good and fresh. The service is also good. I purchased a jugo de naranjilla which was ok; I think she put too much water and it was watery..Never again. Staff is not friendly at all. Not much food ready in the morning.  Bunuelos were as dry as Sheetrock and the fried pork was from at least a day ago. The chorizo a bit pricey but decent.Delicias Calenas Bakery & Restaurant is terrific. I like the vibe of this place. Everything I have ordered has been consistent. It's good & fresh. Service was fantastic and everybody working here was extremely nice and helpful. All great..Fried puffs with a hidden surprise of cheese!A colleague of mine took me here to try some Colombian coffee and breads for breakfast. She recommended the cheesy fried breads/puffs. I got the cheese fried puffs. I hesitated because in my mind, I was thinking bread with liquid cheese oozing out of it... and if you are not a fan of dairy, the thought of it already hurts the tummy. I got the fried bread/puff with cheese just to try since it was only 2 for $1.00.Fried Bread/Puff with Cheese (2 for $1.00) - Oh my goodness... I'm in love! The bread was not oozing out liquid cheese, in fact, you would not know there was cheese if the girl behind the counter told you that it was in there! The dough was perfectly fried on the outside and its texture was a lot like the plain, unsweetened donut. The inside was so soft and fluffy! When you get to the core of the puff ball, you will see hints of cheese but it's not apparent unless you look carefully. It's a very simply bread but it's just perfect for the morning if you cannot handle heavy sugar! I must warn you that it is a bit oily, so get your tissues ready!Colombian Coffee - I drink coffee black. I may not be considered a connoisseur, however, the coffee taste was awesome! Strong coffee taste like what Colombian coffee is supposed to be and not watered down at all. Very enjoyable even without the milk and sugar! The staff behind the counter is not very strong in English but they know enough to take your order. It's definitely not a problem! I was very lucky my colleague is a native Spanish speaker so I got to ask them questions about the ingredients in the delicious breads! Overall, I am very impressed and this will be my new regular spot for breakfast before the start of my work days! It's very inexpensive and I recommend this place for anyone who is in the area!.Walking distance from the Jamaica station, which is great especially when you miss your train and have to wait an hour till the next one. I came in for a snack and ordered a passion fruit shake and some empanadas. Both very delicious and exactly what I wanted, fairly priced. They also have a bar of hot food available and a nice selection if bakery goods..Sucks!!   Dominican thinkin dey Colombians.  Food made by Dominicans wit different spices and ingredients.  Buñuelo tasted no like an original buñuelo.  Place gabbage !!!.Wanting to try Spanish food from another spot rather the one by my house so we went on delivery.com and found this spot. We decided to give it a try and was very satisfied with selecting this restaurant. The delivery came in a efficient time not a long wait.Now as for food it tasted good and we'll seasoned no complaints we'll definitely be ordering from here again. Tip try the tres leches cake it was so freaking good it was the bombdotcom ......The cholado was amazing.  The best I've had.  They didn't try to cheat me on  fresh fruits. Some places try to give you more shaved ice. I didn't try their food, but it looked good. I'll be back if I'm in the area..When craving a Colombian empanada I come here! Is a walk from my job and I love it! The staff is always extra nice and you can never go wrong with all the different varieties of pastries and breads to have with their awesome Colombian coffee."
"Picked up 2 kimbabs, pork cutlet and a spicy bulgogi. The spicy bulgogi tasted good, but I didn't expect the meat to be like ground beef. Just thought it was odd... Pork cutlet was sweet and meaty but a lil bit dry. We both loved the pickled veggies in it. L went in to pick up the order and the ladies were not rude at all to him and he's not Asian so you definitely don't need to speak Korean to receive good service. Everyone has a bad day and it's still difficult times.. We rarely ever get Korean food but I wanted to get a few items in the area and I haven't had kimbab in a long time, so I knew this place was close.. I really like the pickled veggies.. wish there was even more of it..When looking for a quick and delicious meal nearby, this is the place that always comes to mind. This is a no frills Korean place that specializes in a variety of kimbaps. That's not to say that there aren't other things on the menu too, I just tend to gravitate towards kimbaps for a fast meal. My go-to's are the pork katsu kimbap and spicy tuna kimbap. The couple set is also great if you're sharing with someone else. This comes with a kimbap of your choice, pork katsu, and spicy rice cakes.I have ordered through DoorDash for pickup on multiple occasions and had no issues with any of my orders. Upon arriving, walk to the back right for easy and contactless pick up. Just simply look for your name that they have attached to the bag..A casual Korean restaurant that's a popular spot for students (and all ages really). Their food is decently priced and I always opt for their couple set which comes with katsu, kimbap, tteokboki and an assortment of banchan. There are some new additions to their menu from when I last went (years ago) like Korean corn dog which was so good. However for the size, it was a bit pricier than what you'd find at a Korean corn dog only store. But given the fact that this is a one stop shop for all you're Korean food cravings, it's worth it! They currently only do delivery (via food delivery apps) and pickup/to go..I have always been a big fan of rolly kimbab. I used to come here all the time with my bf when we were in college, visiting home during the breaks. I mean we couldn't afford to eat out at super expensive places! We always got the couple set and things have not changed!One of our friends ordered this 2 weeks ago and we had to get it the next day! Of course, we ordered the couple set with the spicy kimbab. Just as yummy as I remembered it to be. The pork cutlet was a little dry and pretty soggy from the sauce... but for some reason still good! They also give SO much rice cake. We couldn't finish it all so I ended up finishing it off during dinner. I like that the rice cake is not extremely spicy that I can't enjoy it. It was a perfect spice level for me..Ordered food here for take out and the employee was extremely rude, I guess if you don't speak Korean, you are not welcomed there!.They sell stew by throwing in expired side dishes into the stew. Do not recommend. They refused refund after complaining about this.Delicious . Perfect place to satisfy your cravings/ affordable dates.Would definitely recommend!.Food: 4/5What's not to love about Korean comfort food? I love kimbab because it's very tasty and convenient.I recently ordered two rolls to go and the kimbab seemed a bit different. I'm not a huge fan of sesame oil and I found their rolls to be too oily previously. This time, it was just right!Maybe it's because of covid and their ""to go"" orders are probably super popular but their rolly kimbab and their tuna kimbab was delicious!.My go to spot for some kimbab! Not expensive and everything tastes great. My favorite kimbabs will have to be the crab salad and spicy squid..The kimbab here are fresh and flavorful. I have both eaten there and ordered delivery and the quality of the kimbabs were equally as good. HOWEVER, my issue is that with delivery, they don't include their banchan and soup, which are normally given to you when you eat there. Why? I have no idea but it's not nice especially since they upcharge their food for delivery."
"Update: I still love Fuji East - almost everything is good - except the salmon. Every time I've gotten salmon it's been over-cooked and painfully dry. Get anything except the salmon.The combination box is a real deal - it's alway enough food for at least two meals.And I still love that fancy dragon roll.And their ice cream and wine are good too..Still my favorite place to eat on Roosevelt Island since moving here in February 2021. And since I wrote the first review, I tried their fancy dragon roll and it might be the most delicious thing I ever ate. Also great - their lunch box special - well worth the price. I get take-out from these guys 2x a week on average and I am never disappointed..Very convenient to my apartment, reasonably priced and super-fast. Almost every order is 10 - 15 minutes. They are also very polite and accommodating..I was really confused with how delicious my dining experience here was. Went to Roosevelt Island for the first time and after biking around, walking, and exploring the area for a few hours, we felt like stopping for some food. For whatever reason, my stomach was telling it it wanted sushi, so I looked sushi up in Google maps and this spot popped up as the only? option in the area. It was quiet when we came in but we were promptly seated and greeted by one of the waitresses here. We tried the sushi/sashimi plate for 2 which came with approximately 35-45 pieces of nigiri/sashimi and sushi in total. I felt like for the price it was solid (especially for NYC) and was pleasantly surprised at how fresh the fish tasted too. Not the spot I would have expected to have good quality sushi (the area seems a bit touristy to me in some ways), but nonetheless I was more than happy and not about to complain!I'm not quite sure if I would venture here just for the food but if I am in the area I will definitely come back here again!.As islanders, we love Fuji East food! It's conveniently located by the subway. They have a variety of options and offer not only indoors/outdoors but also delivery.Yummy rolls and appetizers..Hubs and I decided to be Roosevelt Island tourists on one of those holiday Mondays about 4 yrs ago. After absorbing more history than we already knew about the island and walking aimlessly, Fuji East landed on our laps. Fuji's design is ultra organized. My sushi was very basic, nonetheless fresh and rolled nicely. Plus service as I remember, was pleasant. So if you hop on the Roosevelt Island Tramway, branch out this way for a quick sushi lunch..We ordered from Fuji East about three times while staying in the Island and it never disappointed! We had the chicken and pork katsu with soup and salad, gyoza and edamame. It was delicious! And delivery through Uber Eats was pretty quick..I ordered the Salmon Combination Plate and it was super tasty. Not sure why this place doesn't have a higher rating. My meal was really good!.Reliable Japanese restaurant on ""the rock"" lol (aka Roosevelt Island). Fresh food and friendly service. Hits the spot each time.My favorite restaurant in Roosevelt Island. Went here recently and shared a Sushi platter. Great place to share 20 pieces of sushi with a group. Sushi tasted fresh. Service was quick. Highly recommended it!.Excellent sushi here! I've been several times and never been disappointed. The shrimp tempura is probably my favorite regular roll, the American Dream is a great Fuji specialty. My boyfriend loves the mango chicken, they serve it in right out of a fresh mango! Food is ready quickly, served with excellent presentation, and is always delicious..Thank for this amazing option of fresh fish and rolls on our beloved island! Amazing staff, every time we visit this place meals are amazing tasty and all products are  freshly delivered here! Highly recommended!"
"The Little Pie Company is in fact a little place with little pies (and some bigger ones too). I got a Sugarless Apple Pie, which was pretty good! The crust was nicely baked to a golden color. As the name of the pie suggests, it is a relatively healthy option, but as a result, it was not quite as sweet as I would've liked (I guess that's what I get for trying to be healthy). It was also kind of airy on the inside, so they definitely could've had some more apples in there. I'd say the pie was a fair size for $10.The interior has a couple seats for seating, but seems like most people take the pies to go. The staff are average friendliness.Overall, I enjoyed my pie and would recommend Little Pie Company to other pie fans as well..Happy early Pi Day! There's no better way to celebrate than with an awesome piece of pie. This has been a favorite of mine for a few years. I used to live on this street and you can't beat the amazing smell that wafts out the building. As someone who isn't a huge fruit pie person, I appreciate all the different pie options that they have. They have mini and full pies, which is great especially if you are looking for a personal sized pie. They also have cakes and various coffee/tea/cocoa drinks.Today, I went with the peanut butter chocolate pie, which is a special pie of the month. If you love peanut butter, you need to get this pie! The peanut butter mousse was so light, yet flavorful. I loved the crumbly chocolate crust. The mix of textures was perfection and I would 100% recommend it! In the past, I've had their key lime and pecan pies. Both were just as delicious. I did an online pick up order and it was so easy. My order was ready when I got there and I had prepaid online so I was in and out very quickly.I love supporting local businesses, especially ones with pie as good as this!.If you just want an ordinary pie and nothing short of bad experience this is the place for you. First coming into the pie shop was not inviting and the staff was behind the counter and mucking about. When we decided to order I wanted to order a medium coffee they told me they only had large or small. I went with the larger size. They did not have skim milk apparently they were out.  And offered me almond milk for my trouble. Fine. When I decided to stay for coffee they not only charge me for a small coffee but did not bring me a coffee but an expresso that tasted like dark roasted day old coffee. The staff was ditzy and rude. When I got my pie to my table it was dry and was just an ordinary Mississippi mud brownie no bells nor whistles to justify the 9.95 to charge me for the 5inch pie. My wife ordered the banana coconut cream pie was the better of the two but this nothing justifies the price. It was ordinary pie in a cream sauce with very thinly sliced bananas. I only got three barely noticeable bananas in a heavy cream with a thin crust that was barely a crust it was a commercial made pie not handmade.  The staff was so rude and loud, we left after we were done. There were no napkins to clean up ourselves and the staff didn't even say anything to us on the way out..Looking for some of the best-baked goods in the theater District look no further than the Little pie company. The little pie company has been in the area for the last 33 years. With many of the workers working with the business since the beginning. If you are ever in NYC the little pie company has to be on your list of things to do. The cozy clean and warm space reminds you of the family-owned neighborhood business of the past. When you walk in and everyone knows your name and it feels like home. No one item is best here. All of the items are mouth-watering and made with love. You taste that someone has put some love and experience into the recipes. The prices are amazing for the area the baked goods are baked on the premises and the owner is frequently on site. We were fortunate to meet this amazing human Mr. Arnold Wilkerson, during our visit. From the large picture windows and the delicious baked goods the little pie company. Is a rare gem not only in the theatre district but the entire New York City There are thousands of businesses but a business built on community love and great customer service is like a needle in the haystack? And everyone should experience the magic of the little pie shop..Celebrated Pi Day at this wonderful pie bakery steps away from Port Authority. Make sure to stop here on your next trip to the city. The pies are packaged to be taken home - a bit pricey (5"" pie for $10) but scrumptious. Ordered the pecan pie and a chocolate chip cookie ($1.95) both were wonderful. Will be returning.I found this spot by accident when I first moved into the city and lived in Hells Kitchen. 6 years later, and it's still my go-to for pies of all kind. My favorite is the sour cream apple pie-- between the crumbles on top to the sour yet sweet taste of the apples in the pie-- it's incredible. I've also gotten the pear and the triple berry. When I'm being ""good"" I get the sugarless apple, which is still so good despite being lower in sugar. My husband loved the banana coconut cream pie. I haven't tried one of their chicken pot pies yet, but they are definitely on my list!.Great little spot! Clean inside, tastes super fresh, great variety. I love a good pecan pie and this one was perfect, sweet but not too much and the apple/pear pie crumble was delicious cinnamonyness. Brought it home, warmed with vanilla ice cream and it's 5 stars! The small pies are a little $$ for the size, next time I'll just get a full pie..Pies. Check. Cakes. Check. Cookies. Check. Ice Cream. Check. Free Smells. Check. As long as I've lived in NYC, Little Pie Company has been a solid staple for a sweet snack in Hell's Kitchen. At one point, they had a location downstairs in Grand Central Terminal, which has since closed. This spot is small, quaint, and located on a side street in the heart of the lower 40s, and well, you can't really go wrong with anything you try. So far, I've tried: - Three Berry Pie - decadent. - Gluten-Free Blueberry Apple Crumb Pie - amazing. - Banana Cream Pie - so good!- Red Velvet Cake - brought to a birthday in Fire Island and was a HUGE hit! (yes, it even survived the trip on the LIRR) - Chocolate Chip, Peanut Butter, and Ginger Snap cookies - not the best I've had, but a solid standard. There's so many more sweets I need to taste here, but I can only eat just so many calories.  Then again, just walking by you are accosted by the most luscious aromas of apple pie it's always so tempting just to pop in.  After all, they have regular and little sizes at their shop, too! The little pies are just enough for 2-3 people to share a snack (or even just one if you're feeling peckish). I definitely recommend trying them - that said, don't try the lattes here.  Their espresso and lattes is from a machine and it's not that great.  Stick with the sweets, their specialty, and you won't be disappointed..I came here after hearing that it was a best cheesecake contender. I got the NY style cheesecake ($5) - they got it from the back since I don't like fruit goop on top and that's all they had in front. It was alright - I've had much better elsewhere.However, I couldn't resist getting the sour cream apple walnut pie (small for $10). I enjoyed this much more, and was sharing with a friend eating it cold. However, I warmed the leftovers a few days later and it went to a whole other level! The brown sugar crumble melted in parts and the whole pie was elevated. I would get this again as a bigger pie to share.They have instructions on the box on how to warm it up - I did mine a few minutes longer because I like my food generally hotter than most..The sour cream walnut apple pie here is amazing!! I've had it several times and the crumble on top is delectable. All the other pies look super tasty as well so I'm sure you can't go wrong with any of them..Best. Pie. Ever. Honestly, I love my families homemade apple pie and always thought it was the best. But the sour cream walnut apple pie here is something else. So delicious and just sweet enough. The topping is so delicious. I so highly suggest this. The cashier was also so nice and helpful. Very impressed with my experience here."
"Chinatown / Little Italy 218 Restaurant is a Chinese dine-in/takeout on Grand Street. dining room area is separated from the takeout area. the takeout area has a variety of bbq meats on display. the restaurant is maintained well and clean. it is very much a casual eatery--good for groups or solo eaters. the menu has a large menu of eats outside of the roasted meats.  stopped by on a freezing cold night and needed food, ordered some roasted pork + soy sauce chicken over rice. the meats had nice balance of flavor, meatiness, and fat. it soaks into the rice nicely and makes for satisfying bites of rice + meat. the dish also comes with some cooked shredded cabbage/veggies. i didn't like the cabbage too much bc it was way too pungent for me. i'd order it without the vegetables, next time. two roasted meats over rice, $8.25 + tip. staff is fast and efficient. drops mic cuz carbs + protein ftw  i outzzz.Got a roast duck with roasted pork rice. Good crunch on the roasted pork skin, roast duck is deliciously oily but the cut given to me was a bit too much bone than meat. The soup seems to come with the price and I think it is pretty decent (and such a big portion that you can just use it as a drink throughout the meal). Decent choice and can come back..My go-to take out place in Chinatown for soy sauce chicken (sometimes when I have a protein craving I just buy half a chicken and eat all of that by itself in one sitting for dinner - yes, it's THAT good). Absolutely love their salt and pepper pork chops. For around $14 bucks (they might have raised prices recently- I forget because we always order a whole bunch of things together), the portion is HUGE -like massively exploding out of the container huge, and my bus ride home from Chinatown with it sending wafts of crispy salt and pepper always makes me so hungry. We call it crisssssspy heaven whenever we get that for take out. Also love their beef chow fun, and most recently also started getting their silverfish and egg stir fry, which is just melt in your mouth delicious and a dish that I used to eat frequently when I lived in Hong Kong and Macau but haven't seen often in Chinese restaurant menus here in nyc..Every time I go to Chinatown, this is a mandatory stop! I've eaten a fair share of Chinese bbq but this place stands out. We always get a whole roast duck and a pound of roast pork and eat it over a couple of days. The roast duck has such strong flavoring and the skin is very crispy - tastes so good on some French baguette. The roast pork has a sweet but savory flavor and is amazing over hot rice. This place is so good that my fam always requests for us to bring back some whenever we go home!.Stopped in to pick up a few Chinese BBQ items. We got some cha siu, siew yook, and roast duck. I didn't love the duck because some of the pieces were a bit dry but the other two were good. The cha siu was a bit on the fattier side, which is good or bad depending on your taste. I personally like mine with a little fat, otherwise the meat is tough. The siew yook was probably the best out of the three. We ate it an hour later and the skin was still crispy. We had leftovers and even then, the skin was still crispy - straight out of the fridge.Next time, I'll try their stir fry dishes - or even some of the prepared dishes in the window look pretty good. My only complaint would be that the place smelled a little funky, but what place in Chinatown doesn't? It's a part of the charm..I ordered a Peking duck and fried rice and let me tell you that this is no Peking duck. Just an ordinary roast duck presented as Peking duck. The pancake was dry and the fried rice was bland AF. I do however give thumbs up for the service that was given. The waiter was attentive and really kind to us. Pity about the food. Won't be coming back..First time trying OK218 and will definitely be coming back. The staff is very nice and even moved our table since we ordered more food that can fit on the one we had. They filled our tea whenever it started getting low and sometimes just to put fresh new hot tea in. Everything here was exceptionally good but the stars of the show where the salt and peeper squid which was light and fluffy with a great salt taste to it and the roasted duck. The roasted duck was succulent and roasted perfectly with skin thy melted in your mouth. Even the veggies here where a step above many other places I got to..Good place for simple Cantonese cuisine. I had lunch of black bean spare ribs over rice, it was disappointing only ok since the ribs were tough meat and cuts suck. I like the simple soup that comes with it though like homemade soup. See some people as this is a hangout and eat spot for them..So, I usually get sent here by my elderly to pick them up food.They warned me about the one sales lady who acts like she doesn't want to be there or bothered. They say go to her...so I do...and she brings the goods.They have roast meats which are delicious and fresh every time I have gotten them.The window dishes which you can get a container of or as a rice dish are delicious.The Buddha's Delight with rice is a generous and delicious portion. My go to dish..Stumbled upon this place after intending to eat at a BYOB place next door that had over an hour wait. It is a standard looking restaurant in the heart of Chinatown, one side of it is opened for takeout and the other is for sit-down. It is nothing special at first glance and even a little rundown and outdated, but we gave it a shot anyway. Turns out, I am very happy we did!They have an extensive menu made up of various meat, poultry and fish dishes. They sell 1 or 2 types of beer but they let us drink the beer and wine that we had with us which was nice and even provided glasses and ice for it. We ordered a variety of food to split amongst our party of 4 - sautéed green beans, dumplings, roast pork, roast duck, fried rice, and a specialty noodle dish. The food came out within minutes which was nice - however I felt a bit rushed and would've liked to have a little more of a leisurely dining experience. The pork and green beans were my favorite dishes -- so good and the food came out piping hot.Dinner came out to $22 a person - so cheap for the amount of food we got. I will definitely come back here in the future...dreaming of having that roast pork again. The only thing is, it is 'Cash Only' which I was unaware of until the bill came, so prepare ahead of time."
"The Beef ribs is always juicy and so delish! I absolutely love the food here. It's consistently good..I loved island burger salads so much but was very disappointing when I shake my salad so the dressing can go onto everything . To discovered a lady but in my food  I had to throw it away, I won't ever buy from here ever again..So I work on nostrand and wanted to try this location food. I had the shark with everything on it and sweet potato fries. The shark was fresh. The fries were cool. The only thing I don't like is they do not answer the phone. I have to go in and physically order them wait 15 mins for the food. Mind You  I'm on lunch.The beef ribs is pretty okay and their fries are yummy with the garlic sauce. HOWEVER......the pork baby ribs I got was not right, it had a odd smell to it and when I took a bite I knew it was spoil! I totally lost my appetite..Very disappointed with Island burgers I asked them to put sauce on my food and they said that they don't put sauce on the food they only give you sauce on the side I only got two sauces like that's not even enough for the dry food and why can't I even get sauce on the food anyways I couldn't enjoy the food regret buying this dry food. It's crazy because the food is actually tasty what's disappointing is I can't get enough sauces for my food and they refuse to put sauce on the food and there's no reason why they won't put sauce on the food anymore.Like seriously!! I ordered through Uber eats asked for specific toppings such as mango chutney, coleslaw, lettuce, and red onions I mean at least I got the red onions  and the food was cold..I purchase a burger from them and I can't believe what they sent me am extremely disappointed I would never ever buy food form this place again.I like coming here off the subway on my way home it's a great place to get an island style burger, my wife loves their shrimp & chips and my son loves the huge steak fries. The sauces are unique and tasty, they really enhance the flavor of food. The staff is always friendly and professional, no wonder it's always busy..Island Burger is decent for a quick lunch.I got the chicken salad with plantains, avocado, and cheese. I wish it was more of a salad and not just a bunch of uncut ingredients in a bed of lettuce. But it'll do. With the limited healthy options on Flatbush, this is not bad..Normally I like food from here, but they messed up my mom's order :( We ordered spicy fried wings & a chicken burger, which is what is on the receipt.. but we got chicken strips instead of the burger."
"Great egg sandwich, amazing meats and cheese and the bread was really good.  I will have to make this my new breakfast spot in the bronx..Actually the only Albanian restaurant I've been to and regularly order from. Prices are good for the quality. Very helpful counter staff, maybe the owner, and quick delivery..I came to this restaurant with my partner for a last minute bite to eat before I went to work, and I have to say, I would recommend this restaurant to everyone. It was a very friendly environment and you could totally tell that this is the kind of restaurant that people visit with their family frequently. The restaurant is a traditional Albanian restaurant, with decor that matches the well seasoned food. My partner and I decided to both get the stuffed peppers. The order originally comes with a side of bread and a salad but we opted for mashed potatoes, and onion rings as the appetizer. If you have a small appetite then I wouldn't recommend the stuffed peppers because the portions are huge. The flavor was amazing, even though I could only stomach 1/4 of the peppers. It was so well seasoned and left you wanting more, along with the bread that was extremely fluffy. The mashed potatoes are okay, they're served with a slice of lemon.We also had the rice pudding which was pretty good in my opinion. Server was attentive and welcoming. Will come back soon..I ate there last night. The crowd was all working Albanian men. The portions were generous and the food was excellent. I had to ask for menus because this is a neighborhood restaurant and most patrons know what they want. Many of the items on the menu had Albanian names so I had to look them up on Google before ordering. Among the appetizers I ordered ""speca kajmak"" which is peppers in a cheese sauce. I recommend this dish. Every thing was delicious and the waitress was helpful and very nice..I decided to look on Yelp for dinner. It was my first time ordering from this place and I wanted somthing lean and somewhat healthy. Living in the bronx for 2 years now I never came across this place, (that's odd because my husband and I are restuarant junkies) anywho..... Instead of personally driving there I ordered through Yelp which was fast and easy saw a picture of what I wanted and the price was reasonable, was skeptical on the wait time because I was straving and the wait time was 30-40 mins but I have to say the food from the picture looked appealing so I had to try it out. To my surprise the food came very fast (thank god) I have to say the grilled chicken was the best I tasted in weeks, so moist and tender and seasoned to perfection  and the roasted potatoes was delicious also the salad with the feta cheese was amazing. The only things they forgot was my peta bread, I was a bit disappointed but I'm trying to loose weight again so I guess the potatoes was enough carbs. I will order again from this place anytime. Thanks!.We ordered twice from here in a week. First time, I was feeling brave and wanted to try something new! I came across Nana's kitchen under Mediterranean category and realized that it has mainly Albanian cuisine which is apparently very close to Turkish cuisine. They have Quofte like we have kofte, their suxhuk is same as our sucuk, they serve feta cheese along the salad,  their bread is like our pide, their rice pudding is like our sutlac, list goes on and on. So You get the picture of how similar it is.I was wondering if they could satisfy our high expectations, and ordered kofte plate for my husband with a combination plate( kofte and sucuk) for me. The delivery arrived within the time window.Wow and the kofte tasted amazing. It was well cooked, juicy and has very fulling portions. I didn't like the sucuk a lot- mainly it is me being picky here with the need for particular spices that I want to taste in the sucuk. I ordered baklava and rice pudding as a dessert. Baklava had pecans/chestnuts which I am kind of allergic but my husband liked it. (I like more the pistachio filled baklava- which I can try if they ever put in the menu) I tried the rice pudding: it was very mildly sweet and fresh. I am not a sweet tooth and it satisfied my need for something semi- sweet very well. Overall , The portions were just right. We felt full -not being overfull.Today we ordered again- kofte and quesdia with chicken this time. Again everything was delicious and very timely delivered.So I have all the reasons to love this place- good food, timely delivery and reasonable prices. I definitely recommend Nana's kitchen for those who want to taste good, authentic Albanian/Turkish food in the Bronx..Let me tell you why I love Nana's kitchen and feel like I find a gem in the Bronx.We ordered twice from here in a week.

I definitely recommend Nana's kitchen for those who want to taste good, authentic Albanian/Turkish food in the Bronx..OMG, Nana's Kitchen is actually pretty darn cool. The price is right. The yelp reviews were right, Baklava is really terrific. Not to mention, the service was excellent and the staff was really friendly. Nana's Kitchen - A solid winner..This was my first time trying Albanian food and I came in knowing nothing about what Qebapa is (Albanian sausage) or a lot of other things on the menu meant but our server was really nice and answered all our questions politely.We started with water, I am not sure if they serve tap water or not but our server got us bottled water, which was $1 each.Me and my friend shared the combination platter ($13) - qebapa(5 pieces), Suxhuk(2 pieces) and Qofte(2 pieces) and they were all amazing and had great flavor. It comes with salad, home made bread and feta cheese. The bread and cheese were amazing and the sausages were made fresh. I highly recommend trying the combination, it can be easily shared. The food is not expensive, you get a good quantity for the price you pay. I just think the food was a little saltier and greaser, but that's my personal preference/opinion.I will definitely recommend this place to anyone and will go again when I'm in the area..Great tasting good! Qeboppa like back home Delivery was fast and easy. Next time you're in the Bronx I'd highly recommend trying this restaurant out..Love this place. The food is always fresh and cooked with so much love. No wonder it's called Nana's Kitchen. It's one of my favorite places of the neighborhood."
"Best sushi in BK/NY! Me and my lady are regulars at mikasa. We have a seat by the bar over 2 times a week and always walk out stuffed to the extent where were trying to grasp for air.. The chef is great (Kevin) sushi is amazing and the waiters are at your service at all times!P.S try the mint fluke tempura sushi piece !!.The food overall was okay. The lobster tacos were really small and I didn't really taste the lobster at all. I was mostly eating avocado. The veggie dumplings were okay, wouldn't get them again. The Chilean Sea Bass was too fishy for my taste. The spicy tuna crispy rice wasn't that good, it just tasted average. I did enjoy the snapper with sea salt and salmon with sautéed tomato..I worked here for a few months and it was dreadful. I'd cry before coming in because the staff was terrible and it'd be so busy. We have to pay for our meals and if the cook doesn't like us he will watch us put in our meal and throw away the ticket. The waitresses are bitches and for sure talk shit about you, they do their job tho. the tips they receive does not go to them, it goes to the store owner and that's not right at all. You have teens running your store and you're taking their tips. This place is terrible, terrible people very sad.Honestly used to be my favorite spot ever ! But this last 8 months there is no consistency! Sometimes the sushi is good other times is sucks and sloppy I'm super confused, management needs to step up and do something about it , you can't have one good roll and soggy crispy rice ! And charge the prices you do ! Quality should always be the same not change Day to day it's ridiculous! Even there spicy mayo is not the same it has a sour Taste !!!!! I used to spend $300 a week here but I sorry not anymore! It's a waste plenty of better places !.Absolute garbage sushi!Not fresh!Small Pieces!Rude russian (though hot teen) service!Prices are Ridiculous!No joke!!!I dont get how russians and other brooklyn sheeple go to this stinkhole?Especially when there are a ton of decent sushi places 5 minutes away on Sheephead bay road.Decor is just ok.You've been warned!.if you have read my reviews you will understand that i know my sushi, and that i do not just do drive by shoot up reviews...this place is a joke,  my order sucked.  0 out of 10.     nothing more to say.I worked here for 4 days. Just so you all know, they take the tips of waitresses. Pretty much rich customer dominated restaurant meaning we were getting big tips. Those tips were not split amongst the waitresses. Instead they were taken.. Super rude waitresses and super rude manager. It was a shit show of 4 days, although it felt like much longer!.Came to your restaurant today,That's a nice place, good food, but PLEASE change your waiter lol. I use to go to sushi restaurants 3-4 times in a week, but would never come back in here. Waiter probably Russian (I am russian-speaking as well) who told me she is a manager was super rude since I came in. Im not even talking about folding my glass and pouring the drink, Im absolutely fine with doing it myself though. But checking my table every single minute and not even taking the dishes I don't need anymore. She came to my table around 15 times (Im not even joking) and when I asked does she really have to do that, cz I felt like I have to leave faster, she said ""yes, how am I suppose to see from there""? In a very rude manner. Then she went to her co-workers to discuss it and they started laughing on me TOGETHER! Lol. Almost infront of me, and I could hear that! Left a tips, but also a note, that it was my worst service ever! Hope to never comeback again but I work in a next buoldin ;( Other people including chief were nice and when I dropped my sticks (Cz I was super nervous because of the waiter) chief kindly told me to get a new one! The only bad experience is a waiter! And also at the end when I get my change back She didn't even put the check on my table, she put it to the NEXT table lol. I mean you don't have to be super nice, but just don't be super rude to your customers, that's enough! And as I mentioned in a check note, IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE CUSTOMER, DON'T SHOW IT! And once again!) Read it till you learn it, young ""lady""! :)P.S. Usually I am a nice person but not this time, sorry. :).I just had the privilege of dining here and as full as I am, I am still thinking about how good my dinner experience just was. I'm visiting from Miami so I like to think that my tastebuds are accustomed to great sushi - Sushi Mikasa did not disappoint - it actually triumphed. Everything was extremely fresh and as a little girl, I happily (and surprisingly myself) packed it in. The Toro with grilled onion was insane, the poke bowl was indescribably fresh, and the scallop was perfection (which isn't an easy feat). I'm jealous Brooklyn has this local gem bc I want it for myself. I genuinely don't think you can go wrong here - families, date night, solo mission - I'll make my way back for sure!.This is the most disgusting sushi i have ever eat! Not worth the money!  Very expensive but very small portions. Fushimi restaurant is much better and cheaper.  I do not recommend this place."
"Terrific theater with very modern amenities and design compared to most other theaters in the city.  The theater is in the basement.  The hallways are spacious, the bathrooms modern and clean, and the setting crisp and minimalistic (as the first reviewer mentioned).  The seats are very comfortable, and more spacious compared to the very tiny seats in the much older theaters that usually house smaller Broadway productions and also compared to Carnegie Hall.  Still, a fat person sat beside me and looked only moderately comfortable.The air conditioning was a bit too high... we were pretty cold while dressed for the hot summer weather outside.  Some people complained about the cold at intermission, but there was little discernible change in temperature in the second half..Please come early for seat selection as the black box theater is very small (62 seats). There's a waiting room/ lobby just outside the performance area which sells a few snacks & drinks before the start of the show and during intermission. No food or drinks are allowed inside during the show. I absolutely loved seeing Too Heavy for Your Pocket so much that we returned to experience it a second time. It had a great run, and the actors were all so talented. Their beautiful voices were simply a bonus. The intimate setting amplified the deliberate periods of silence throughout the show. There were moments when you didn't want to even breathe in fear of interrupting the show. It was that emotional at times.If I can expect this level of performance with other visits to The Roundabout Theater, then I will surely be back for future shows..The venue was easy to get to via the subway, easy to see and find on the road and it was clean. Seats had a great amount of legroom and were pretty comfortable.I was in the front row, far right on the top level. View was pretty great except that on the front row, there was a handrail that would obscure anything on the bottom front of the stage. For the most part, it didn't bother me but I think because the space in between the seats, I would have been better off on the second row of the mezzanine. The snacks and drinks were good.Saw Into The Woods. SUCH a fun take on the show, it was beautiful, funny, and entertaining.Will def come back!.Another of the roundabout theaters.  Actually there are two theaters in the space the main theater is downstairs and the have a black box (60 seats) that is for new works.  Their hit show bad Jews started in the black box and transferred to the main stage.  Just saw a show called ""humans"".  Great cast. Definitely check it out.  The have escalator or elevator to get up & down to theater..Death Takes A Holiday ( roundabouttheatre.org/of… ), a musical, is charming and magical.Hard to gor wrong if it's a Roundabout production..I love this theatre, for having such a wonderful play ""Language Archive"".The interesting part of this place, is that the theatre is located down under the basement level. Not that its a negative feature, this makes this thatre a quiet, uninterrupted, absorbing environment for all the thatre lovers.The set was beautiful, quite minimalistic, plus very creative.If you are a fan of Julia Cho's work,You should never miss ""Language Archive""!!This was such a creative, profound, and most of all so much entertaining play I've ever seen in my life.The main character is a linguist who struggles to keep the endangered language from all around the world. He mourns for the death of the language, because he believes the death of the language is the death of the whole: culture, memories, and even the way of thinking. Although He might be a successful linguist, his love life breaks down.The story is a journey of this linguist, trying to figure out why his wife weeped all the time when she was with him, or alone, and left him while leaving mysterious messages inside random places, like his coffee cup, books, or shoes.Everyone speaks language. However, there is a language that only the intimate two speaks. Your sight, your attitude, or even your feelings can imply a special meaning to each other.If the special vibe that we speak to each other disappears, then even when the language exist, the connection disappears.We want to grasp a part of our life, for example by taking a photograph.Nevertheless, if the life is gone, the photograph can't bring the life back.Language is important, because it speaks life.Nevertheless, if the life is gone, the language can't bring the life back.Shin.This will constitute a 2 part review.  One for the theater and one for the show.The theater itself is small enough that every seat is close to the stage to see the acting & props clearly and hear the dialogue.  Probably has around 300 seats or so.  It is located in the basement and handicapped individuals are escorted via the backdoor elevator.The Roundabout Theater Company presented ""Sons of the Prophet"" on the night I was invited.  This one and half hour play is broken up into about a half dozen scenes without an intermission.  It presents a former healthy, athletic and gay individual who suddenly struggles with life altering knee pains and family tragedy with a unique family story.  There is the deranged boss, the flamboyantly gay younger brother, the stroller wheeling outspoken and opinionated old uncle, the young black man trying to be remorseful for a prank act, and the gay reporter going to great lengths to get the story.This play was filled with drama with moments of funny lines and surprising acts.  The story itself wasn't anything stimulating to think about.  It could pass as a reality play.One more note:  prepare for the elderly to sit next to you with some moans and grunts. Lol..This theatre was quaint and charming. We watched an off-broadway show called ""Dinner with Friends"" here. I really enjoyed the show. The theatre's entrance is located off to the side and the actual theatre where the shows are is located down in the basement..The mainstage theater is an escalator flight down from the box office area.  There is a coat check available downstairs near the theater.  The theater is small and modern in style without any ornate decorations or chandeliers.  But, what it does have are good sight lines from any seat and comfortable seating.   It is a small theater with only three rows in the Mezzanine level.  I have sat in a few different locations in the Orchestra section (including the the side section and the first and back rows in the center) and the view and sound were good from all locations.  The productions (musical & play) that I've seen here have been of high quality.  Sons of the Prophet, which just finished its run this month, was excellent and better than I expected..Death Takes A Holiday and Son of a Prophet. This theater is truly a great place to see great actors and enjoyable plots. Round about theater group is truly a great organization. Also this theater is small enough too see everything yet still a enough space to make the production seem packed. There is definitely an older crowd, but it is well worth watching the shows they put on here."
"Was drawn in to see this play by the fact that they ""captured"" Jake Gyllenhaal to star in it. I figured such a terrific actor would only sign on to a phenomonel role.The acting deserved 5 stars. Really well done and very believable in their character roles. There were points in the play that were very serious and profound, others that were very funny, and unfortunately, others that bored the hell out of me. I think the hardest part of the play was straining to make out the accents. The cast were to have British accents (although they strangely sounded Irish to me) and sometimes a few words or even a sentence was lost on me because they were speaking too fast in a very heavy accent. At the end of the show, my friend mentioned having the same difficulty. Overall, glad I saw the performance but not sure I would classify it as a must see. I think it may have been better as a 45 minute short story than a 1.5 hour drama but that's just my opinion."
"I've seen ""Harvey"" and ""The Real Thing"" here through their amazing HipTix program (for young theater goers). It's only $25 a ticket! Yes, they're mezzanine seats and pretty high up but usually their theaters are small enough that the view isn't so bad. And come on, $25?! You can't beat it! Sign up!Drinks are a bit ridiculously over priced ($34 for two rum and cokes). Merchandise is a bit much but that's to be expected.Both shows, I was able to meet the celebrities afterwards. They are really nice about it and come out after their shows for autographs (usually no pictures though as it slows them down too much).  Got to meet Jim Parsons, Ewan McGregor (the LOVE of my life! and he wished me a happy birthday), as well as Maggie Gyllenhaal, Cynthia Nixon and Josh Hamilton! Roundabout gets some AMAZING casts so definitely check them out and join the discount program. it's well worth it..Great productions, but DO NOT give these people your phone number!  They will not stop calling despite begging, pleading or yelling!It's a disgusting, evil sales practice!  You have been warned!.I have to agree with the other poster.  I got a subscription to a season and have been harassed by them ever since.  I moved to the West Coast over 2 years ago and have told them that on numerous occasions and yet got another phone call today.LEAVE ME ALONE!!!.I saw both caberet with emma stone and the real thing with maggie gylenhal.  The shows were great and because.it was equity week I got to see them both up close when they were passing the hat for equity fights aids.   Wow wow wow they are beautiful women and so talented..I bought tickets to a Roundabout production three years ago, and still get sales calls from them despite asking them repeatedly to stop.  It is harassment, plain and simple.  I do not recommend giving this organization your phone number.  Even if they do not do it intentionally, it is clear that their organization is simply incapable of maintaining the integrity of their customer database..I saw ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" here at the Roundabout Theatre - what an amazing experience! The show was absolutely incredible, and the theater itself is beautiful..The aggressive phone marketing by this company actually makes me generally avoid  Roundabout Productions.  Here's how it works:  you buy a ticket and they pluck your phone number from the order form.  They proceed to call you at dinner time maybe 20 times.  Finally, after 20 requests to stop it,  the calls stop.  Then you decide to see another Roundabout show and the process repeats itself because they claim to have no way to keep a phone number off the call list with future purchases.  This practice is deplorable and it is costing them good will and probably business.  The Democratic Party candidates of NY cannot top this operation for intrusiveness."
"Thursday Aug 12 2021 the bingo hall is reopening With a great game doors open at 5pm game starts 715 pm Will be openThursday Friday Saturday Sunday Nights all games start 715pm.So much fun!!!! Never really understood gambling addiction until i came here  lol. Games so by so fast, and it's super fun just trying to keep up. The people here love helping you out!.5th Hall should be a designated Landmark...Wow..great food...super clean and wonderful service...spent a great nite there with a table of friends...won some money also...making it a perfect experience.Guaranteed fun! Everyone is super friendly and welcoming. It was hard to learn at first (there's a whole schedule) and then we got the hang of it worth the help of the friendly crowd..Went to play some bingo here with friends. Don't normally play bingo. It was amazing. Great experience. The people were so helpful and supportive. And the games were great..Oh wow. Where do I begin? I love a weird subculture SO MUCH.First of all, It's hard for me to believe that this business didn't already exist in Yelp and I had to add it. It is one of the greatest institutions in Brooklyn! On the one hand, I don't want it to become overrun with hipsters but on the other hand, do hipsters like bingo? And any income we can give the 5th Avenue Bingo Hall is good income.Let me set the scene. There's a narrow entryway in the heart of Park Slope, you walk down a flight of stairs into the basement, and you enter a room that feels like a giant cafeteria set about 30 years ago. A bleach-blonde woman with a labret piercing, skin-tight leopard print clothes, and a New York accent straight out of a movie greets you. ""Youz with themz over there?"" she asks as she points to the table of Park Slope young folks, clearly out of place. ""Uh, yeah, how'd you know?"" She then sells you bingo cards for the night ($3 to enter, $0.50 per card, totaling $11.50) and you go buy an ink stamp thingy for $1 and some chips for the boards. A couple pointers: get there by 7pm, you won't want to miss any games and it'll take you a couple rounds to get the hang of it. Also, try and seat yourself near someone who looks kind and helpful -- this scene is cutthroat, and most of the people here are grumpy as hell. We were lucky to be by the birthday girl, who'd been playing bingo since 1965 and was happy to shout tips across the table. ""This round is the pink sheets!"" ""This one is the boards!"" ""Clear your boards, it's over, it's over!"" ""Don't forget, four corners equals bingo!""A standard win is $20 split among however many people who won on that number, there are some rounds where the winnings vary depending on how many people are playing, and the jackpot our night was $2000 for the final blackout bingo.Oh, and I can't forget the food! There is a full-service cafeteria complete with table service so you don't have to break out of your bingo zone. It's the cheapest dinner in Park Slope -- food and drink ranging from $0.95 to $4.95 with hamburgers at $2.95, if that gives you an idea.This is the greatest find in Park Slope!.We went tonight to play bingo, and had a great time.  Nice clean bingo hall in a very safe neighborhood.  The crowd is older and very welcoming of new players.  We enjoyed very much..When I was about five years old I had a babysitter named Betty. She was in her 60s and loved bingo and mah jong. I remember her taking us to the bingo hall and there being two rooms. We sat in the larger room and only saw the smaller room from the outside. It had glass walls and the inside looked like clouds. Clouds and clouds of smoke! I would spread my little cards out on the table and match the numbers on the screen with my numbers on my cards. If it was a good day the other women would give me enough wrapped candies to cover the free space on the center of every bingo card! I don't remember if Betty ever won but I remember enjoying the experience alot and all the women being nice and colorfully dressed. This was in Texas in the early 80s. Last Friday I went to Fifth Avenue Bingo and was transported back in time! It was wonderful and just like I remember the bingo experience so long ago. The whole evening only cost $3 to play three hours! The food was cheap and brought to our table, so as to never miss a number. The women were just as colorful. A few pieces of advice: bring a pocket full of pennies to use as markers so you don't have to purchase any. Also, you'll hear alot of things being shouted out during the games and will accumulate questions along the way. If you want the answers and all the bingo gossip, go outside during an intermission, the smokers were more than happy to tell me anything I wanted to know and we're eager to make my experience a pleasurable one. Good luck!.just a great fun place to goreally good prize money is given out every nightsat nights they now have a 15,000 thousand dollargame yes you heard me right and i did win on this gameso i really a happy person very clean place and great fooddont know what else to say but go its great !.This bingo hall caters to the Latino community. And it seems that those are the winners. The staff is not friendly at all. The waitress is the only person..I thought was nice. I get upset every time I say I will give them another chance..a waste of a bingo hall!!!"
"I was very pleased with my meal here and was impressed with the quality of the food. We ordered the Thai Special Steak first. The string beans were cooked to perfection and had the perfect amount of crunch. The steak was also very good, not too chewy. We also ordered the beef and broccoli. The sauce was very flavorful and it also came with a good amount of beef in it which I was happy about. Sometimes when I go to other places and order this dish, it is mostly broccoli and not enough meat. This was not the case here. Lastly, we got the chicken udon soup. The broth was flavorful and had delicious and crunchy veggies in it like sugar snap peas, water chestnuts, bean sprouts, carrots, baby corn, etc. There was a good amount of chicken too. My only complaints with this experience were there were barely any udon noodles in the soup and we were very late with getting our rice. We didn't get our rice until we were more than halfway through the meal. Other than these two small factors, I was pleased with this meal..The food was okay, but the service was abysmal but that didn't stop them for automatically charging us a 20% tip for not clearing plates during an obvious business meeting...and we were the only one's there!There are great Kosher places all around Brooklyn, this place needs work. Those that have read my reviews know I hate giving a negative one. People forget bad food, but never bad service. I'll be back in a few weeks, I'll let you know if I caught them on an off day. I hope I did..The Mongolian beef done medium was soft and not too spicy.  Singapore noodles were curried..I've changed my mind and now rate this place 2 stars (and that feels generous). I won't be coming back. I ordered from here again recently and the food was downright terrible. Not a vegetable to be seen in the lo mein and the beef in one of the dishes was definitely off. It smelled wrong and tasted wrong and we threw it out after one taste each. And there was a black moldy piece of cabbage in my pickled vegetables..I have mixed feelings about Estihana, but overall I'd give it a four - but that's for eating in the restaurant, not getting takeout. I think this place is about 8-10 years past its heyday, which might explain why it's so empty so often, but I still enjoy it. Perhaps its the memories I have from years ago here, or perhaps I just enjoy sickly sweet food (seriously, the shredded crispy beef literally makes my teeth ache!), but eating here makes me feel good. I have gotten takeout a few times, however, and I would not advise it. I found the chicken to be overcooked and dry, no matter how quickly I picked it up..Went here with my friends for my bday and it was quite bad. The sushi part of the food was not really edible. Other food was ok. Service was pretty terrible. It's a fairly small restaurant but it took a long time for some of the orders to come out, particularly the sushi ones. Waiter was also rude, didn't give out napkins, asked us to hurry up and finish but then took forever with the check. Bad.Very good sushi and Asian food. You have a large menu of nigiri , sashimi and sushi with a very nice menu on a tablet.Delicious sushi and great prices. The wonton soup was also delicious. I went at an odd hour but we weren't the only people in there, but the waiters were not so attentive. Conveniently, there's a wine store across the street and you can bring your own bottles as long as the owner can see the bottle first to confirm it's mevushal..Best kosher chinese in the world by far. We love estihana teaneck but Brooklyn is even better.Estihana is where people go when they want to go somewhere nice with their kids. It's not a doting dining experience, the water is left your table so you can help yourself. Don't expect dressed up service going there.You should expect good food, a friendly ambiance, and relaxed service -and you'll get exactly that.The food is delicious. My favorite dish on our table, because of course I sampled what everyone had ordered, was the Orange Beef (may have been called Orange Peel). It was out-of-this-world-rocking-good.Our waiter (Asher?) was helpful and delightfully merry when he assured us that everything was ""delicious"" -an affirmation I could tell he repeats all too often. When we ordered the crispy shredded beef as a starter for the table, he suggested my sister order something other than the sesame (or was it the sesame?) as her entree due to its similar taste with the starter.Of course, ending off with a hot cookie and ice cream is always, always a good idea!.Ordered off of Seamless. When I opened my delivery bag, I kid you not a tiny roach crawled out. It was disgusting. The food was sealed but still what's the point of buying kosher if there's roaches crawling around? My family refused to eat but I still did because I just paid 20$ for lo mein...won't be ordering again.Edit: wow guess this place has a roach problems should have read the reviews here before ordering"
"Tonight I ordered grilled salmon with cabbage, broccoli and extra garlic sauce. I also ordered split pea soup. The salmon and vegetables were so good I forgot to take pictures. That sauce just put this food over the top. I was doing a happy dance while I ate. Now for the disappointment. That darn split pea soup was cold. Who wants cold soup. I took away a star for that..This restaurant just isn't worth the hassle anymore . From the lazy workers , the terrible owner / manager the less than stellar bbq chicken and inconsistent quality fish  , the absolutely ridiculous wait times and the worst of the worst the heightened risk of catching Covid because all the workers refuse to wear masks while in a tiny enclosed space . Good riddance to this restaurant I once rated a 5 star!.Jus Fishy popped up as an option for food and I was ok with that .The one and only thing not to like about this place is the wait time. But if you want good quality and special care taken with preparing your meal then put on your big boy.. or big girl pants and wait. The bake and shark is the way to go . Absolute perfection . The Shark is super Juicy cooked to perfection and has very distinct flavors unlike other restaurants passing off other fishes for it.The bake although it isn't my favorite, seemingly is perfectly made for the shark but can also be purchased on the side and eaten with other stuff such as cheese etc if you like it.I also tried their Salmon Burger was also very juicy and flavorful but the condiments on it took away abit of the distinct salmon taste. Overall though it was definitely good but I would opt for the shark. Their side ordersss are also oh so good . Great big portions and just delicately handled to preserve it's natural flavor. I can only vouch for the acra and corn for the moment though but I am sure they are all homeruns . I really really like this place . I hope they are around for years to come because it seems alot of these up and coming healthier food restaurants in these areas don't fare as well as crappy McDonalds and other junk food sellers. Their prices are just right so if you are in the mood for some well executed fish sandwiches or even fish and chips then don't hesitate..I ordered grilled shrimp, mac and cheese and veggies. The shrimp were the frozen medium farm raised kind. Yes, I can taste the difference. I lived in Seaport so what do you expect? The mac and cheese and veggies were bland bland and bland. I was surprised because the other location's food is on point. I was hungry so I drowned the food with pepper sauce and ate a little bit. This food was disappointing and I probably won't be back.. I'll go back to the other location up the street..This is a great restaurant in the PLG Community! I was looking for something healthy but also tasty and they really fit the bill. I got the grilled salmon meal that comes with 2 sides. You get a large piece of salmon on top of the two sides you order. I got the mixed vegetables and okra. They were delicious. The mixed vegetables consisted of broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, a small piece of corn on the Cobb and some carrots. The okra was perfectly cooked as well and the salmon was excellently seasoned. I order this for delivery. The meal also comes with a side of house made hot sauce that was delicious, and a white sauce the looked like ranch. Definitely give this place a try if you're looking for quality fish or just a healthy, well prepared meal..I was in the neighborhood on a Friday evening. The restaurant is extremely small, there's no waiting capacity due to covid. The online menu doesn't match the actual menu; snapper isn't on the online menu but they had it in person. My dad wanted the shark which was on the online menu but they didn't have any more. The food took over an hour; when we inquired about out order, the person said we have a list...okkk seems like it tastes a long time to grill fish. I got grilled salmon, mac n cheese & plantains..everything was dry. The salmon was good once I put the included sauce on top (not sure what it was); mac n cheese was dry: plantains were hard & dry. My dad got the grilled snapper with broccoli & cauliflower, which he really enjoyed. Overall, I wouldn't waste my time on this place again..This place is worth the hype! The grilled salmon was cooked to perfection and I ordered the garlic sauce, which was amazing. For my two sides I ordered the vegetable rice and steamed broccoli. The portion size was also very generous unlike other seafood restaurants in the neighborhood. I would definitely order from here again!.I've had this place on the radar for about a month. As I'm eating better and doing long extended walks; I decided after my walk to Flatbush, I would finally visit. I arrived a little after 12PM. I was standing around for about five minutes or so, I didn't see anyone; finally a woman comes out, but she doesn't even acknowledge me and goes back in. A few minutes later, a postal worker came, she shouted out mail and the woman returns, only then does she finally ask me what I want. (-1)I step outside to wait for the food to be made, I see the same lady back out laughing with another customer. I have my headphones on outside, so I hear some very loud yelling (unbeknownst to me, she was trying to let me know my food was ready)--I just didn't find the service to be up to par, as a whole, but now onto the food.I order Salmon (order comes with two sides--I went with Broccoli and Macaroni and cheese). The salmon was excellent, it was very well seasoned too. Macaroni was great too, the broccoli could have been a little softer. However, I'd rate the food 9 out of 10.If you want great food with a side of attitude/being a bit, this is definitely your place. I'd probably return and hope that the service was a little better and that would surely make me a repeat customer!.It's rare when indulgence and nutritious meet in one dish but the grilled salmon over veggie rice  with broccoli here accomplishes this rare feat. The salmon is moist, flavorful, and filling while the rice and broccoli is satisfying but not greasy or excessive.This is a solid takeout option I'll will certainly keep in my meal solution arsenal..Listen- DO NOT CONFUSE THIS JUS FISHY WITH JUS FISH AND BEYOND!!!! The latter restaurant is BOOTLEG AS HELL!!!! While THIS Jus Fishy restaurant is EVERYTHANG!!! BAY BAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!! When I tell you how I almost fell out when I counted ALL THOSE BIG ASS SHRIMPS in my Salmon and Shrimp AND THEY REMEMBERED THE SALMON!!!! The other spot forgot the salmon like THREE times!!! IN A ROW!! THEN GOT MAD ME FOR BEING MAD!  And the little ass miniscule amount of shrimp with my sides did NOT a meal make! But at Jus Fishy, you can eat the salmon and make the shrimp you don't eat leftovers for another complete meal. AND DID I TELL YOU HOW BIG THE SALMON WAS? No I didn't did I, so let me tell you. HALF! I COULD ONLY EAT HALF THE SALMON AND HALF THE SHRIMP.....I forced myself to eat all of it because dammit waste not want not and it was damn good. The kind of food you eat, take a break, have a food coma nap then wake up and finish! Yep! ORDER FROM HERE ONLY ( not the other location I promise they triflin as hell). You will NOT be dissapointed. If you are, let me know so I can call them out!!!.Just fishy is in the heart of crown heights tucked away on Flatbush ave... If your not paying attention you just might kiss this gem! So my Dad actually put me on to the spot and I Have ordered from them about 4 times already!! I even got my significant other to order from there as well.  Disclaimer: KING FISH SELLS OUT THE QUICKEST. OKAY, so it's pretty small inside but they do have seating and a TV so your not just aimlessly waiting. The customer  service is exceptional and the food is GREAT. Very flavorful and tasty to the mouth and body. I have wanted to try there grilled king fish but as I mentioned it sells out fast. I have yet to try it. Which is a bit dissapointing. BUTTT JUST FISHY IS BECOMING A STAPLE FOOD SPOT TO ORDER FROM. I order the grilled salmon w/ lo mein and sweet plantains. Pro's: flavorful salmon and lo' mein is jusr so bomb little spice fresh and taste so rich. (In my opinion )Con's : sweet plantains aren't always as sweet as anticipated which I hope they get better with. They still tatse ok but it takes away from the food and being that you order sweet plantains and you get ones that are semi ripe or not ripe at all diminishes the experience and make you not want it anymore. Plating is very neat and portions are well worth the mount paid. Besides the one con just fishy is a go too. GO CHECK OUT GREAT CARRIBEAN FOOD.

"The food is so fresh and so delicious! Do yourself a favor... go and enjoy you won't be disappointed!.Tried it twice Dry and tough to chew chicken, parathas are thick and oily.Please eat something else than a below average food..Just  average Shammi Kabab roll . Not bad Chicken Tikka roll . Not so bad Spicy Potato Chips n really  bad Gajar Halwa bites summarizes my experience in a nutshell. It's a tiny hole in the wall take out place in NYC that we found.From their menu description their rolls seems appetizing but in reality they didn't taste match up to our imagination . Chicken tikka roll was mildly spiced & it lacked the grilled flavor. Chicken was also  overcooked  .Shammi roll has Lamb croquettes which was also flavorless and didn't offer any wow factor . Carrot Halwa bites was missing the cardamom and seemed quite bland ! Didn't live up to its hype !.Overpriced and extremely rude staff! I'm better of making Kati rolls myself at home. One is also not enough for most people as it is a tiny and thin paratha roll. Two is a better idea if you want to feel satisfied. They also charge $1 each for every sauce you may want. What a rip off! Also, recently I tried the Too Good to go app and reserved a Kati roll surprise bag and was shocked at how nonchalant and disrespectful the staff were. They acted like they didn't know what it was and acted like there wasn't any food left. The food was paid for and reserved on the app so I expected to get my food. After some argument with one of the staff, the food was somehow magically found. Terrible! Don't recommend going to this Midtown East location!.I ordered vegetarian achari paneer roll at the 53rd Street loc. They instead served me Shammi Roll. I took it back to them with the receipt and told them this hurt my religious sentiments and they asked me to leave the place . Very insensitive and unprofessional..Not sure if the problem is with the location or generally standard of Kati roll company has fallen below par.We ordered egg roll, chicken and egg roll and one aalpo egg roll for take out.There was hardly any filling in either and negligible amount of chutney filling. The bread on Kati roll was dry and thick.There was nothing positive to really talk about the food here. Substandar at best..This place is nowhere near authentic..flavorless,cold,unfresh is what comes to mind instead. There are much better Indian eateries in manhattan then this place..so please save ur time/appetite and money and skip this place!.This location was good, not the best I had been to but the food was still good.It's a small location but they often are, they weren't the fastest or overly friendly to say the least, and I feel like I payed too much for the amount of food given.  This is pretty standard with the kathi roll company actually.If you go, get the lamb and the goat, the chicken too.Skip the cheese.The white sauce is slightly bland and way thin, it'll cost you to get extra even though they don't put enough on to begin with.All this being said I still enjoy the flavors these things pack in, especially on the whole wheat rather than the flour rolls..The kati roll is a trustworthy solid spot. Unfortunately it has gotten more and more expensive over time. Also, I recently tried the momos and didn't enjoy them. I would recommend sticking with any of the rolls; don't forget you need two of them to be a meal!.I had a order they forgot about and didn't cancel, closing early and I went out in the freezing rain to get it. Knocked for 20 Minutes . Another time they closed early and locked the doors too but there was still someone there.  I called and called, they don't answer their phone. The food tastes good but there's not a lot of filling. There are a lot of onions in the tofu one but only 3 cherry tomatoes. Thick naan burrito basically."
"This is the best Subway location. The store is always spotless. Bread always soft. Veggies always fresh. They make your sandwiches with such care. I only eat Subway at this location. I'm dedicated to them now..The best subways I've ever had in my whole lifetime!!!!!! They are so efficient, great with quality, never an issue with my food!!!!! Always providing the best service especially when I deliver via Uber eats . I always get the Italian sub with artisan bread toasted, added bacon pickles Mayo Parmesan vinaigrette provolone cheese .  My boyfriend had gotten the chicken and bacon with ranch sauce on artisan bread! So happy I found a really awesome subway spot near me! Also the cookies are great! They taste freshly baked!.Asian lady is very rude to her customers. I was just eating and saw her disrespect another older woman for just sitting there for 5 minutes and she had her uniform on and it showed that she was tired but she approached her in a very disrespectful manner and told her to leave meanwhile she could've decided to order something. Unacceptable..Not too bad. Young Asian woman making the sandwich was a little bit difficult to understand but was friendly and I got what I ordered..Very bad customer service. I have tried different subs and they are all bad in quality compared to other subway places. While it is very good location where many students and youth want to come. This bad service makes me and my friends not to visit again but its the closest subway to my place.One person working during lunch time... Slow and broken English. 20 minuets to get a sandwich..If there was an option to give negative stars, this place would get one. How does the subway run out of bread at 6 p.m. for the dinner rush. The staff is as cold as their coldcuts, and as lifeless as the veggies!! They skimp on every aspect of your sandwich, and you do NOT get your money's worth (like any other Subway). Do yourself a favor and take a walk to the next one!.To answer many of you   YES   this place is under   NEW  Mgmt and who-ever took over is beyond   cheap+ tight + stingey!   I went in on NATL SUB DAY where Subway sent me a personal email to go in and enjoy a free SUB for the DAY  - they denied it   NO !  I was told nastily  go to another place we no honor it   LOL ....................once I told Corporate man were they in trouble !!!!   NEVER AGAIN -stay clear   so not worth it ..This place must be under new management.  It used to be clean and have competent staff. Now it seems dirty and the staff seems lazy. They actually told me they had no bread or chicken left at 4PM !?!?!? Ridiculous, especially when they are open until like 10PM. I want the old staff back :(.I agree with the anonymous poster who states that this location must be under new management.  In addition to being extremely stingy with the vegetable toppings (on a veggie sandwich, no less!) to the extent of literally placing six olive slices--one on top of each tomato slice!--there seem to be some odd policies in place.  Perhaps the strangest is that I called for a delivery tonight (which I've never done before, but they have advertised this service for at least two years) and was told that it was too far for them to deliver to me because they didn't have a bike.  This doesn't seem unreasonable until you factor in that I am four blocks and three avenues from this location.  The complaint was about the avenue; apparently they don't deliver to locations on my avenue regardless of how close it is because they deem it too time consuming.  I couldn't help but wonder if the manager knew that the employees were citing this fact, but when I asked to speak to one I was told he won't be in until tomorrow.Subway is a convenience food, but lately, at least from this location, it is definitely not convenient."
"Dominos has really been a saving grace during the pandemic. They always come in clutch. It gets the job done it's fast food so you know. This location is clean and the staff is polite..I am a bit concerned. I observed the employee putting the toppings on the pizza with his bare hands. I said something and one employee tried to make excuses about it being raw food and being allowed. Then the bare handed employee went to wash his hands and then put on glove once he saw me reach for my phone to take pictures. Really not safe especially during Covid. He seemed way too comfortable gloveless and handling food. The public is entrusting these establishments to handle or food with safety and caution this is terrible!!!! They need more supervision at night. Clearly a manager was not watching. Sooo frightening.I went to this Dominos with my brother. We ended up staying at this Dominos for 30 minutes for ONE medium pan pizza. You might say ""They have other people to serve."" No, because we were the only ones there and there were no other orders on the board. The workers were completely rude and barely spoke english. We had to ask if they had our pizza, if we didn't ask, we wouldn't have got our pizza. Speaking of pizza, this pizza was way too saucy. Yes, I know pizza is supposed to be saucy, but when I mean too much sauce, I mean sauce dripping down on my fingers, sauce all over my mouth and sauce all over this pizza. When I held the pizza up, the cheese fell off of it completely. Looking at this pizza, the slices weren't even even cut and lined up properly. Despite everything we've seen, we still ate the pizza. My brother ate 4 pizzas, meanwhile I ate 1. A few hours later my brother was feeling sick. We went to the doctor and realized it was food poisoning. Thank you Dominos for giving my brother food poisoning!.So me and my sisters were very hungry and we wanted to get dominos so we went there. We smelt the delicious smell of pizza as we place our order of A Medium Pepperoni Panned Pizza 20 minutes later we still didn't receive our pizza so me and my sisters had to go up to the counter and asking for our pizza. We ended up waiting a extra 10 minutes for our pizza, and i don't wanna sound like a i expected my pizza in 5 minutes but there was no line so i was very confused, Angry, and starving. Once we got to the house we opened the pizza box and to see a huge load of cheese and sauce. I didn't get extra cheese so i was very annoyed since i don't  like a lot of cheese on my pizzas there was so much cheese that it dropped onto my shirt and pants. 2 bites in and my stomach started to hurt, i didn't want to think i got any food poisoning or anything so i tried to wash it down with a glass of water which didn't help. I strongly hope that you don't order food from here since i had the worse experience ever..When the pizza was being made it said that is was gonna take about 10 mins. Me and my sister had to wait 20 mins for the medium panned pizza untill we told them where our order. As soon as we got our pizza we headed home but once we got him the pizza was all soggy and saucey when i opened it, the pizza wasn't even cut professionally . I was hungry so i ate about 4 slices of pizza and few hours later my stomach started to feel weird and i didn't eat anything after that pizza ..What a disappointment! You have to be Kidding me . That's what I get for not opening the boxes at checkout. I would've never purchased this sad looking dry cracker tasting ""sandwich "". $10.00 down the drain ..Need more trainning. Manager has horrible attitude. They dont care about serving the community but want your money. Definitely wont come back here again.I was intrigued to try a cheese less pizza and I figured let's start here. I placed an online order for a small cheese less pizza with green and red peppers. The tomato sauce was okay, I liked that they weren't stingy with it and it really coated the base of the pizza. The buttery, garlic rub that they use really made up for the salt factor. Can you tell I enjoyed it? I barely was able to take a pic lol.Be prepared to be bombarded with a thick middle eastern accent upon entry. I placed an online carry out order for their $7.99 large 3-topping pizza and breadsticks for an extra $1. I went to pick it up and I don't know if the person thought I was middle eastern but I'm pretty sure that what he said to me wasn't English. After I said ""what"" he then attempted to speak slowly and English. He then asked if ""I have free pizza"" because my total came up to $9.77 with tax. I was slightly confused because he was asking me as if he didn't know? ( I couldn't tell if it was a question or a statement) Or maybe he wasn't familiar with the promotion? I'm not sure.Anywho, the pizza I ordered was a large pizza with extra cheese, bacon, and green peppers and it was delicious! Finally good pizza ! I ordered the cinnamon breadsticks and it was decadent ! Now that I got past the language barrier I'll definitely come back..I ordered pizza from here last Friday. After 50 minutes passed (and the online tracker saying the pizza was delivered), I called the store and was told it would be there very soon. Well, after 40 more minutes passed, I called again and was told the driver had been pulled over by the cops.So ten more minutes went by and the pizzas finally showed. It's literally the only time I wouldnt have tipped a deliveryperson except the tip had already been put on the card.  The pizzas were dry and cold.I messaged the corporate's Twitter account and after providing them with my information, was told the local manager would be contacting me. A week later and nothing.  I have received six or seven promotional emails (even after unsubscribing). I hope that $30 was worth it because I will never order from this place again..This is by far the Worst! Dominos that I have ever ordered from!! I am highly disgusted and disappointed with what was delivered to my door! We found a dead fly underneath the pizza inside of the box, but we had already eaten most of the pizza until we realized.  We felt disgusted and my family and I were still debating on whether we should go back to them or not  , but I would never ever order from this place again! How disrespectful and disgusting!!"
"I love speakeasies and I try to visit them as much as I can. So many cool ones in NYC. This one is located next to happiest hour and although it isn't too disguised it still is cool. You walk down the stairs to an indiscreet door and go in. It is like you step into a completely different vibe. It is dimly lit with a seating at the bar and small tables.  It was not busy at the time and so we enjoyed the calmness of the place. The service was good and the drinks were solid. The prices are typical nyc prices but you pay for the well crafted cocktails. We also ordered the fried green tomatoes to snack on. They had a small bar menu that had an eclectic array of stuff. I really enjoyed the time there with my wife and would come back. It checked off all the boxes we were looking for. Good stuff Slowly Shirley!.I am a huge fan of speakeasy during winter, and this place didn't disappoint. I was here with a group of 5 on a weekend. We waited for about 15 minutes on a bar upstairs. Odd enough, this speakeasy shared the same staircase as the bathroom for the bar on the ground floor. The decor was nice, and the staff were friendly and chatty. The cocktails were strong but delicious. Two of my friends ordered the large drinks for sharing, they were overpriced and mostly ice -- so avoid those. But overall, I would come here again if I am in the neighborhood..Fine time in this speakeasy. While it's not the best, if you're in the area and want some 7/10 cocktails. This is the place to go. Skip the Happiest Hour and head down here. If you want a seat, head there early in the night. Otherwise you'll be standing all night. This place has low stars because the default drinks are a little uninspired and often taste syrupy. If you have the chance, just tell the bartender what you're interested in and they will whip you something up real neat..We live a few doors down from the Happiest Hour but haven't had a chance to stop in for a couple years. A couple nights ago some good friends of ours wanted to visit Slowly Shirley, their downstairs speakeasy for a drink. We began our night with some Mac and Cheese bites, the grilled cheese sandwich and some excellent cocktails. As fun as our night was, there certainly was a lull. When I met Carlyn (sp?)I stepped out to the street for a quick cigarette and entered the bar from the Happiest Hour entrance as the downstairs door was locked with no host. When I stepped to the foot of the stairs I felt two hands grab me, which is when I met Carlyn who was chatting with a friend nearby when I passed her. She grabbed my arms and asked ""uhhh what're you doing?"" To which I responded, ""Joining my group? Is there a problem?"" She said ""Where's your group?"" ""Downstairs. Do you need a phone number?"" She then blankly stared at me and said ""fine."" So again I asked, ""Is that a problem?"". She rolled her eyes and replied ""I'm the new host so I don't know who you are."" I just walked downstairs and rejoined my group. It's not my job to inform everyone in the restaurant changing shifts where I am sitting and who I am with. If that were the case, every time a waiter or bartender swapped out we would all have to re-reserve our table. I've never had someone put their actual hands on me in a restaurant and it was unbelievable startling, not to mention entirely inappropriate. For the amount of money spend on food and drinks in a quick two hour span with the wonderful ladies and gentleman downstairs, this should have been a non-issue. Our party spent a little over $300 on cocktails and apps which were wonderful. However, given this experience, we probably won't return. I'm not interested in being scolded on a night out for patronizing a local gem..I came here with my friend on Thursday night. This is a superior cocktail spot in Village. The service was good and they came to add water without being asked. Drinks are a little pricey, but it's true that they make decent cocktails. I had rosemary's spring which was made of Rye. Love it..I was meeting a friend for happy hour and managed to secure a reservation at 6pm. First off, the hostess was absolutely lovely and I was seated right away (even though, I told her that my other party was going to be late, she didn't mind). Secondly, Morgan is a wonderful server - she was attentive, friendly and made an excellent recommendation. Third of all - the Curse of Lo Pan might be the most delicious cocktail I've ever had. They were so good, I managed to have three without realizing it (and yes, I'm a total lightweight). Lastly, the snacks were on-point, and I enjoyed the shishito peppers & french fries. They were lovely enough to call me in advance of my reservation to let me know that it was comedy night (starts at 8pm, and the first Tuesday of the month, I believe). We did stay to see the initial introduction and the first part of the comic, but I had to rush home and couldn't stick around for more (bummer!).I love speakeasies and this is a gem..Came here because The Happiest Hour above was full, and it ended being a great call. The vibe was less rambunctious restaurant and more speakeasy. Generous-sized cocktails for the prices, plus a bunch of the food from the restaurant upstairs- a great burger and fries for $14 felt like a steal in New York. Only qualm was that the tables were pretty close together, so getting in and out involved some squeezing from us and those around us. Will definitely be going back!.Speak easy with a retro vibe, Slowly Shirley is a small intimate spot perfect for a date or small group looking for a cocktail before or after dinner.I beg to differ with the 2$$ next to the name, this place is a 3$$$ establishment with cocktails averaging $16-$30. On Saturday night at 7:45pm the four of us didn't have to wait and went right in (note they wouldn't sit until all guest are present).The cocktail list is impressive, with pages and pages of a drink for everyone. Can't give a play by play what was in it but ""The Monkey Man"" & ""Chinatown Daiquiri"" were delicious.  Wouldn't necessary spend the whole evening there but going for a drink before dinner is what I would recommend..Amazing tiki bar where the owners display an admirable dedication to drinks, food and decor. I had and loved the Angry Bastard, and the tempura broccoli is to die for. Fish dip was great too. Definitely will be back!Edit 8/2018: Docking a star because I was a little let down this time. They don't have the Dirty Bastard anymore, but it's cool that they change the menu up. (I actually don't remember which cocktail I had this time, but I enjoyed it. World's best yelp reviewer, I know.) What disappointed me was the food. I had the burger and fries and thought the fries were over-salted, while the burger was just not flavorful. My friend liked his cider and grilled cheese, and overall we had a nice time, but it wasn't as magical as my first experience here..TLDR manager accuses me of being drunk and wouldn't let me in even though I already had a table. Rude, disrespectful. Manager is offensive. No care for customers.Why go to a place that would treat their customers this way - with absolutely no respect. It's one thing if the bouncer is rude and offensive, but it's a completely different story when the MANAGER is rude, disrespectful, and offensive.When I got there, they had me wait while they confirmed my table - I already had a table and the rest of the party was there waiting for me. Bouncer checks my ID and the staff asks me for the table name. After a while, the manager whispers in her ear and she tells me I can't enter. ""Why?"" I ask. ""The manager says you're not allowed,"" she says. ""I already have a table downstairs. They're waiting for me."" ""Sorry but the manager says you can't go down."" ""Really?"" I ask as I look at the manager, ""why am I not allowed in?"" He looks away and the girl responds, ""He says you're drunk."" ""Are you joking? I haven't had a drink today.""She doesn't look surprised at all to tell me this. It seems as though they do this to their customers often. Slowly Shirley's policies are clearly nonexistent if they're letting the manager talk shit to customers. They finally let me in probably because I was getting irritated and starting to raise my voice. The manager probably didn't want the customers next to us to notice that he was making flimsy wild accusations. Customers shouldn't be treated this way - this is too low. I won't tolerate this and will not come back. I do not recommend this bar. No drink can compensate for the assholery of the staff. And, to top it all off, it was nearly empty downstairs."
"I LOVE this bakery. Before we moved to Florida this bakery and just one other was my go to for warm baked bread with butter!! I love bread. The bread is made fresh in house every day. You can have it plain, hot right out of the oven or you can ask for it to be split and buttered, placed in the press, flattened to a thin crispy perfection and enjoyed just like that!!! OMG!! Every time I am back home we get bread, of course we have to get about 3 or 4 because half of one will be eaten on the way back home and the rest will be enjoyed by all of us with coffee for adults and hot chocolate for the kids. This bakery also bakes wonderful cakes, cookies, and donuts and serves coffee, hot chocolate and also have refrigerated juices and drinks. The service is friendly and quick. In the mornings, if you don't get in before the rush, you will wait a bit but not too long."
"One word Delicious!  I am writing this 24 hours after eating there thinking I could eat the chicken curry again. To bad they don't deliver to Manhattan. We went for lunch and the staff were very mindful of social distancing and we felt comfortable with the dining arrangements. My friends had the Guinness Stew. We shared a plate of chips. Yes real chips to dunk into the sauces. We will definitely be going back. The server was wonderful. We had our Irish coffee's to go so she made a fresh pot to make sure it would be hot enough for our trip back to our friends. I can think of nothing to complain about. Everybody needs to take a trip to the Bronx to try it out..Edit: reheated the steak and it was decent. Adding a star Not the worst but unfortunately the food didn't live up to expectations.Tomato soup- tasted like it was from a canCaesar salad- way too much dressing and it tasted like Thousand Island dressing Filet mignon steak- over cooked and tasteless. Medium well steak was very well done. Medium steak was medium rare in the middle and well done everywhere else. This is after being cooked butterfly. Drenched it with steak sauce. Potato mash/ veggies/ rice/ mushrooms- no complains Service- took a while to bring out the steak but overall fine..Only had desert, but it was rather underwhelming.  Ordered the ""homemade apple pie"" which was weird, flat, and had a strange taste to it.  The Ice Cream was OK.  The Snickers desert was store bought and again nothing to it..Comfortable and cozy old school Irish restaurant- been in riverdale forever according to the server.My first time in Riverdale after our day at the zoo.   While looking over the menu asking for traditional Irish food, the server recommended their steak and seafood dishes. I had never been to an Irish steakhouse and the friendly server told me this was a very Irish populated area with an Irish butcher, gift shops and here- an Irish steakhouse, interesting... So I ordered the steak, which came as a good and hearty, filling meal with sides of a soup or salad, choice of carb and mixed vegetables.  I am very particular with my steaks and potatoes; I like my steak melt in your mouth tender and bursting w flavor, and my potatoes whipped, fluffy and probably with way too much creamy butter.  I thought the Potatoes and mixed vegetables were a little dry, and steak while good with blue cheese on top was not as tender juicy and flavorful as I love my steaks. Being so particular I think I will stick to true typical Irish food in an Irish restaurant next time. The apple pie with ice cream was good, and so was the Shiraz and Guinness.The server was very nice, friendly, happy to seat us in a booth with an outlet so I could charge my phone and then chatting about the Irish area and their own restaurant. A cozy comfortable and friendly Irish restaurant to have a hearty meal..The Riverdale steakhouse !Great food, staff, & atmosphere.Welcoming all people as Family members !Where you can have a few pints !Watch sports & conversations !Friendly patrons & bartenders .Who make you feel at home .a touch of Ireland in the Brinx.This place is wonderfully Irish. As you enter you can either hitch it to the right for the bar or to the left for the formal dining area. Unfortunately we were seated in a musty basement, so we weren't able to enjoy the decor!The menu is somewhat what you're expect for a bar and grill, if limited. So we split salmon and steak. The steak was pretty awful if I'm honest. It was congealed with fat. The meat was not at all flavored. The salad that was served on the side was a bit overly most and tasted a if it was somewhat old. The bright spot was the salmon. It was served with a great crispy topping..I got the steak sandwich to go. It was delicious. The meat was really juicy and tender. Also got the baileys cheesecake for dessert and that was yum. Patricia took my order and was as always a pleasure to deal with..Great restaurant for excellent food is a festive and welcoming atmosphere. Staff is warm and welcoming and food is great!.Great food at a fair price I deducted a star because the service could of been better. I went there at 1pm on a Thursday and sat at the bar at which there was one other patron, I ordered a lunch entree which was delicious; after that the bartender was inattentive. I will go back again..Just had a terrific frozen marguerita (and homemade apple pie to be honest) at Riverdale Steak House (Connaughton's). Asked for not too sweet and Patrons and it was completely perfect. Will definitely return."
"Number of times I've been here: Countless of times over the years.I had lunch here today and ordered off the lunch special menu: shrimp with lobster sauce with brown rice that comes with a free egg drop soup. I liked the sauce's thickness unlike some other places where the sauce is a little watery. It had good flavor, as opposed to being bland. I like how this restaurant offers brown rice, giving me the illusion that I'm getting my daily fiber.I've ordered delivery from them many times, and their highlights include their thai menu, beef with broccoli, general tso's chicken, seafood pan fried (delicious), crab rangoon, and spring rolls (crunchy and tasty). I like the ""clean"" quality of their food. However, a few weeks ago, I tried their general tso's fish, and I wasn't impressed with it for being too saucy with little fish portions. The chicken version is the way to go. They offer a thai menu and it's great. Their pad thai noodles are different and I'd choose those thin and less greasy noodles, peppered with peanuts, over lo mein.The restaurant itself is dark and appears grimey, but that's how all Chinese takeout look like. At the very least, I see that A grade on the window. Just don't mind the roar of the elevated J train outside if you're dining in... or drop the fork and cover your ears. The staff are friendly and I make sure to say goodbye to them before I leave. Don't worry... you'll see me again very soon.Four stars... I really like this place. Will I return? Yes. Golden Kitchen is my go-to place for Chinese takeout..I only come here because it's the only ""decent"" Chinese restaurant in the area. But when I go to Long Island I go to Lin Garden because the food is better. They give you more and it's worth the price and they don't overcook the food. Every time I call in my order for here if the guy answers my food is screwed. My boneless spare ribs ALWAYS end up overcooked..Oh my God, Golden Kitchen was actually exceptional. Lots of people come here. Every single thing that we have ordered was incredibly fresh and tasty. Staff are very pleasant and service is very fast. Loved it. Will definitely return!.I have ordered here twice in the past week. The first time the experience was great, ordered 2 spring rolls for lunch. They was absolutely delicious. Today I decided let's try a lunch special. Bad idea...ordered the chicken wings with French fires. The chicken tasted as if they had fried it earlier in the morning and let it sit out until someone ordered it. The fries, idk where they got these from but even freezer fries taste better than the ones that they serve. Do not go. Prices may be competitive but you will regret it later than night..Food was delivered. It was a lunch special, chicken in garlic sauce. It really had very little chicken and a lot of vegetables. Pork fried rice was ok, more hispanic style than chineset, again very little pork. Although the food tasted fresh, I won't order from here again because I had never had so little meat even in a lunch special. Delivery was fast..They have great food and great staff. I ordered the General Tso Chicken and it was really good. The prices are affordable too, will come again..Expertly prepared and  delicious Chinese & Thai Cusine. I had the Singapore Mai fun Chicken which was great. If I lived nearby I would order delivery too..The food is average at best and the service is horrible. The guy is especially disrespectful and they definitely say things behind your back. Theres a lot better Chinese restaurants.Honestly, I've been going to this place for the last almost 15 years. They've been decent, and I have been super loyal, ordering from only this Chinese takeout. But, lately, I have been hanging out with a few friends, and brought them over, and it seems they are racist. They over charge me, they're rude, they don't offer me the same kind of respect. I haven't said anything because, quite frankly, I don't want to embarrass anyone. But this has been happening for way too long, and I'm sorry, but I just ca't anymore..Food is good enough that I had to leave a positive review. Everything I've tried so far has been great and the wings in honey sauce are.My husbands favorite Chinese spot. Their food is very good and delivery is super fast, my only complaint is they never ask you what kind of soda you want they assume coke."
"I like this spot. Good place to pick up a quick sandwich or bagel in the morning. They got the tofu cream cheese, which is a big A+ in my book. Lactose free yaaaas. Bagels are average size. None of the over-compensating of those giant ones packed with refined flour you can find elsewhere. Friendly staff. Decent prices..I work about a block away from this place so come here often. After eating their bagels many times- they have definitely changed their recipe or supplier (not sure if they make bagels in-house). The bagels USED to taste kind of plastic-y and old but are much fresher now. They give you a generous amount of bacon and they are filling sandwiches. Their iced coffee is always perfect every time I order it. They do have a lot of offerings that most typical bagel/deli spots do like salads, paninis, etc..Not that good, not that bad either. This is your typical run of the mill NYC deli. Got a pastrami with the works on a toasted poppy bagel. The sandwich was really cheap compared to the bodegas and delis elsewhere but the bagel was more like a roll. Overall quality was meh and there's so many other options close by..Rip off.   Added cucumber to a buttered bagels.   $3 for 5 small slices.     I asked for a few more slices.  They said no unless I paid more.  The bagel was burnt too..2 is super fair. I ordered the 5th Ave Hangover. The sandwich called for prosciutto but on my hero laid ham. Not sure if they tried to pull a fast one but I literally knew on the first bite. The bread chicken was definitely made 2+ days ago and sitting in a refrigerator. Deli rule number 1 - fresh. I can't believe some delis don't grasp this concept. The bread was meh, they toasted it so it probably was pretty lame prior.Register guy didn't say a word, not even my total. Just looked up at my and grabbed my card. Not cool homie, hospitality is key..I usually order a smoothie from here breakfast from here via Grubhub and found out today that they add sugar syrups into the smoothie to enhance the sweetness of the fruit WITHOUT listing this on their menu. I had called to ask because my smoothie was very sweet and they confirmed that they added sugar syrup with a half hearted apology. For those who are diabetic or have dietary restrictions, this is not safe food practice. I tried to get a refund through Grubhub but the restaurant refused to give one. Very awful customer service..Won't be back to this place anymore I don't like when stores change the prices and over charge you for delivery if i walk in there and pay $10 for something and then I get a delivery and you charge me $11 that's not right so they lost me as a customer for good and I hope a lot of you won't go here there's plenty of bagel stores that are better then them anyway.Wish there was a negative 5 stars.   How can you mess up a bagel with jalapeño cream cheese  lightly toasted. Please someone explain this to me. When a customer asks  for lightly toasted it means your just warming up the bagel not burn it and when I mean burnt it was literally a charcoal briquette.  As for the jalapeño cream cheese.  It was cream chEese with a whole jalapeño in it. Not even sliced up. I had to throw it out.  Would not have even given it to a person in need of food. Please don't waste your money nor time in this place..I go to this bagel shop everyday i love their food especially their coffee great employees very friendly and respectful i would recommend this place to everyone!! I have gone to several bage shops and they were awful i'm glad i found this place!!!!.Dont buy here,they constantly crew up my orders and the owner has a pretty nasty attitude."
"I've walked by this place a lot and have been wanting to stop by each time. I'm glad I finally got around to it :) We shared drinks, 3 apps, and 3 mains, and I think that's the way to do it here because you've really gotta try it all. Ambience was sweet and cozy. The wine list was extensive and divine. Most notable of the starters was the sweet potato croquette. We got the 3 vegetarian pasta dishes (spaghetti aglio & olio, malfatti, reginette) and the best of the best was the malfatti. The oyster mushrooms were just comically delicious. You know how when something tastes so good you just gotta laugh? Exactly that. Will def be back :).This was a good spot for a girls night with a few friends. Two of us ordered the special for the night, which was a tortellini-like pasta filled with ricotta and mushrooms then topped with a rich sauce, mushrooms and shaved truffles. I ordered the smoked spaghetti. The pasta was perfectly Al dente and topped with a creamy, smokey sauce. We also ordered the sweet potato croquettes, which were the highlight of our meal. Bread was complimentary as well-- and one of the breads included was a great focaccia bread topped with tomato. We ordered a few bottles of wine. The first one that was recommended to us was pretty funky, a bit acidic. The bottle didn't say it was a natural wine, but the taste reminded me of others I have tried. The other bottles had a much lighter taste to them. Portion-wise, you will not go hungry after the pasta. All of us were beyond full by the end!.Everything I've had here has been really good. They use top quality ingredients, and the fresh pasta is always cooked perfectly. I've dined in several times, and the service has been pretty good. One out of every four times you'll get a bad experience since they don't stager the seating and wait staff gets overwhelmed. I've never had a dish that I was blown away by, but nothing has been bad either. Lately, I've been just ordering from their pasta shop, where you can get amazing fresh pasta, seasonal ravioli, and gnocchi.  I use to do this more often, but now you have to order ahead. I loved being able to go in, look things over and have someone talk to me about what was in everything. They'd give tips on cooking the ravioli, or which sauces to pair with each pasta. I really miss that..I really liked the vibes and the dim lighting of this restaurant! I think most of the staff is from Italy...I ordered the spaghetti dish and it was so simple yet so tasty. My friends and I ordered the charcuterie board and it was really delicious - would definitely get that again if I come back. Glad they had gluten free options as well since one of the friends I went with has a gluten allergy.I wanted to treat myself so I ordered an aperol spritz and a tiramisu. I really enjoyed both items and would get them again. I just think the prices are a bit high for the portion size. E.Lunch review:Everything was nearly perfect: Pasta, natty wine list, staffs and atmosphere were amazing.I would order all the pasta dishes.  I would skip the  steak and eggs.  Their brunch menu pastas are slightly different from their dinner menu. Their complimentary focaccia blows other NYC focaccia out of the water They have a really cute backyard seating area I recommend for those who want outdoor seating, but want to stay slightly warm..Delicious delicious delicious!Started with a grilled cabbage salad some sweet potato croquettes and a radicchio salad.all super tasty .for main entrees a smoked spaghetti was. Awesome fresh and tasty with just the right hint of Cambrian chili . A bass was really good as was a kale pesto pasta fresh and delicious. Always good. Yummy. Friendly and welcoming..I love, love, love this place.  First of all, we have been here many times, each time the food, service and drinks are just as good as the first time!  The pastas are amazing, fresh and unique.  One special was a rye pasta, that was so unique, and so delicious with a putanesca sauce.  The smoked pasta with hazelnuts is amazing as well.  We started with a few different salads which were fresh and delicious.  The chef really takes pride in the food and it shows!.This is an awesome place.  Talk about fresh pastas, they really deliver.  IT is a great place to share plates with a group as there is so much goodness.  We had some of the special apps and the pastas from the menu plus a cheesy mushroom pasta which was unbelievable.  A definite place to keep coming back to.The service was super friendly, warm and so helpful with drinks and wines.  I loved the attention that we received from all the staff..When your friend who is actually from Italy says a restaurant has some of the best pasta they ever had, you go to that restaurant!LaRina is a cute and charming spot right on Myrtle Avenue. It has a cute front which has expanded since the pandemic. A cozy inside where you can also purchase products/food to go. And a cool backyard. The pastas are amazing. Everything baked is delicious. The breads are so good. I found that their gnocchi and lasagna were unbelievable, but my favorite hands down was their bucatini. I highly recommend LaRina for anyone who loves pasta..Ordered their New Years Eve dinner special and a few extra dishes to feed 4 people.Overall, the quality of the food was excellent. I would probably deduct half a star due to the fact that we had to do some light cooking / combining of prepared ingredients and the instructions were quite vague, but we managed in the end.Highlights were:- smoked spaghetti (5/5): I was honestly a bit shocked how much I liked this dish because I rarely like spaghetti dishes - I usually opt for other pasta. But wow the Smokey and spicy flavors work wonderfully.- that FOCACCIA! (5/5) We ordered 1lb and we did not regret doing that. It's homemade and so fluffy, definitely order.- I loved the black cod and squash dish (4.5/5) we ordered as well, very good quality.I also ordered a package of 3 wine bottles and the 2 we went through were very good. I would as a general rule trust the dishes coming out of this kitchen..I had a great lunch at LaRina. I had stayed away because I was so sad that my favorite Clinton Hill restaurant was located in the building. I had been missing some great meals. We sat outside and it was around 35 degrees but they had a covering and heat lamps. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The menu was very appealing and we ordered a dish of the day: pancakes with raspberries and blueberries with home made cream. They were the best I've ever had. The people dining with me loved the coffee. So I went all out and ordered an Affogato and the espresso and gelato were fantastic. There is a little food shop and I plan to go back. I will say that the food is expensive, so it won't be a regular place. It was very charming and as I said the food is very good, great for a special meal..Honestly, this place is amazing. I'm one of those insufferable people who studied abroad in Italy like 20 years ago and hasn't shut up about it since. And I have to tell you, LaRina has some of the best Italian food I've had in the states. The croquettes!! My friend and I poured over them like they were gold. The tagliatelle was incredible, as was the agnolotti. The gelato with figs was the perfect way to end a meal. Light, sweet, and fruity (and for what it's worth, I usually stick to decadent chocolate desserts).  Oh, and the staff actually checks vaccination cards which was a relief."
"Pretty good. Moderate speed; not too busy. The lady who helped me actually gave me the toppings I asked for, which is a rarity (at other locations they give you too much or too little).The lady working there had an accent that made her difficult to understand, but it wasn't a big deal.Plenty of seating..Subway keeps raising prices and quality is stagnant. If you want a decent sandwich, try Potbelly or a corner deli. Subway's catchy jingles are history and all you're left with is bunk coupons and expensive combo prices ($2.75 for soda & chips?!). Lunch used to cost me about $6.50, now it's nearly $8.I think I'm done with you Subway, just like you're done with fat Jared..Great healthy food. A staple in the area. There is always a line. Highly recommend this great place.The soda refills sign is gone. The crew is routinely pleasant and efficient and the ingredients are fresh. They've stopped offering the spicy cheese slices, so now its just American, Swiss or Provolone. For the diet conscious, they offer flatbread and salads, and they will scoop out your bread upon request to lower the cals..The bread, meats, cheeses and toppings are fresh. The shop has an old rusty feel to it but the food prep area is bright, shiny and clean. The line can be long at lunch time, especially when a footlongs sale is underway. Some of the staff recognize me and say hello. All are quick, efficient and accurate. Seating is a bit limited but fairly typical for a Subway; a single at seating for four fully expects to share the available seating, so don't hesitate to ask. Soda refills are 75 cents - kind of a bummer; if you eat in, refills should be free. I used the Subway member card until recently but refuse to register it because they ask for too much personal info. So I will be visiting a lot less often, sorry to say. The corp requires registration; I wonder if they realize how many people will be turned off by requests for DOB and cell phone nos?.Line is long on lunch time but they are quick ...... Don't go to late in the afternoon like 4 or 5 they run out of things like bread variety from the lunch rushes"
"Fast and accurate. No fuss and good milk tea. I like how Gong Cha allows for adjustments in sugar level and ice. TBH I like it waay better than Tiger Sugar.Currently (due to COVID), it is a window where you order, pay, wait a bit, and get your milk tea; no sitting area. But I like it like that.It is in an inconspicuous corner among other grocery stores and shops so it is easy to miss. But once you find it, it is worth it..They filmed Gong With The Wind and Gong In Sixty Seconds here. But not Gong Baby Gong. That was at a different GC location.This is the GC location that is in the new up-and-coming bustling Chinatown of Brooklyn. Yes Brooklyn has its own Chinatown and it's pretty awesome. It's not as great as Flushing or as famous as Manhattan version but it's still really cool.So come and give it a try. See what you think. This GC is right on the corner and it's pretty busy and pretty cool and pretty standard really. I like it but I'm not going to give it five stars because I've been starting to be obsessed with things like Sharetea and Tea Top when it comes to the chain franchises lately.And I guess we should end with -Students love it more than they love Beer PONG CHAIt's so addictive they could put it in a BONG CHAMy flagpole makes your bf's look like a little PRONG CHABut I know you'll forgive him if he takes you to GONG CHA.This is a very tiny space (very small) but wow... they somehow manage their orders correctly.Impressive line management, quick service and they make a pretty good boba drink. Just wish the place looks slightly neater... I was craving my brown sugar boba, and found a substitute version... here at Gong Cha, it's call ""Dirty Brown Sugar"" and I had it hot! It was pretty good.  Gong Cha - actual boba are smaller than their competitors.  Went back another day and tried the cold version.  I still preferred the cold version but in the midst of frigid weather... the hot ""dirty brown sugar"" boba is a good option.  Enjoy!.4 stars for the drinks BUT!! 1 star for the serviceWe went there on Sunday, July 7th. I then point at Milk form green tea on the menu in front of the counter and ordered with big face Asian lady. She then respond Milk green tea? I say ""yes, milk foam green tea"". And also ordered brown sugar oolong tea .  It should be done right? But nope!! We got wrong orders. We walked back to the store asking the same lady politely that we got the wrong one. She saids she didn't hear that I ordered Milk Foam Green Tea. She also assure that she repeat it to me. I saids I heard that and I also did repeat Milk foam green tea 2 times.Long story short, she told us to pay more. We are okay to pay more if those drink were price differently. But she told us to pay FOR A NEW WHOLE DRINK ?? Excuse me! Are you kidding me? I denied. We then argued a little while. Thing that made me upset is she thought that she is right and the way she acted is arrogant. I know that her English is not her first language but she should get her ear checked several time before placing the order. I have never argued so loud like this in my life. I used to worked at restaurant and I would say apologize and give them a new drink rather than arguing with them. I'm pretty sure that making one more drink for apologize is better than lose your customers. I saw that this lady also got one complained on yelp. Dont she not willing to improve her customer service? What a shame!.Soft opening! 20% off drinks! 01/05/2018 to 01/07/2018 - All Top 10, Buy One Get One Free! Gong Cha's presence is much welcomed to the neighborhood!My go-to drinks are the Lychee Oolong Tea and the Honey Green Tea. As a pure tea lover, Gong Cha's strength is the fresh brewed tea which you can taste the difference compared to other chains. Toppings are different as well such as the white pearl jellies which are a better alternative and not as sugary as the black tapioca. I always appreciate the fact that I can adjust the sugar level and ice level here!.This Gong Cha is small and basically people come in to get the drinks and then leave. There's a small bench for people to sit on if they want to sit and drink or just sit to wait for their order. I went in to purchase an egg waffle or bubble waffle. I got the original one and I had to wait 10 minutes for it which was fine because I wasn't busy. If you want ice cream on your waffle, that's an extra dollar. The girls who work the counter are nice and speak mandarin and english, so that was helpful because I didn't speak mandarin. After 10 minutes, I got my bubble waffle. It was piping hot and they put it in a small paper container and then into a small plastic bag. The waffle is was too doughy and I felt like they could have cooked it longer or used less batter to make it lighter and crispier..Would prefer this place for bubble tea. Sugar and ice can be adjusted. However, some of the cashiers just gotta get their ears checked like they just don't understand what your order is. More like they are all Asians and have a heavy accent. I'm Asian myself but still they can't get my order correct. Overall, I would still go back once in a while for the drinks because it does taste good. J.Would prefer this place for bubble tea. Sugar and ice can be adjusted.

Overall, I would still go back once in a while for the drinks because it does taste good lol.drank it and found a hair in it！It made me sick all day. I suspect the store is sanitary.Can't be happier than this !! Gongcha near 8th ave !? It's about time that one has opened One of my favorite drinks are the honey green tea (for my green tea lovers that can't stand the bitterness. This is for you!) and the original milk tea and green milk tea both are amazing. Both have their own unique taste ! Definitely try their other concoctions I've been here countless times since opening and it is never disappointing..What's up with this milk foam drink? This was my first time ordering outside of my usual matcha flavor and loved it. I had the milk foam earl grey, milk foam oolong tea and lemon yogurt. The teas were so strong and tasty! I surprisingly enjoyed the lemon yogurt drink as well. I loved that all the drinks did not have the fake powder taste. I have no idea if they use powder or not but I enjoyed the calories from these drinks."
"- good beers- good service- no happy hour- good for game watching- wings are a little too saucy- wings have great reheat value  They tasted better once the sauce settled in.I mentally noted this place while walking by it as a good place to eat out doors. This weekend, we are finally graced with some decent weather and I thought now would be a great time to try it out! When we arrived there were already people sitting outside but still a good amount of seats available. We sat down right away and was greeted by our server who presented us the menus. Their menu is quite large. A lot of selections to choose from. They even have breakfast on the weekends but it's only available before 2 pm. We tried ordering a breakfast burrito at 210 but It was already too late. They are pretty strict on that I guess. We ended up ordering the buffalo cauliflower, fish tacos and crab cake salad. Buffalo cauliflower was by far my favorite of all the dishes. It was perfectly crispy and not falling apart. It was hot and soft on the inside with the perfect amount of buffalo sauce. I was thoroughly impressed they made this boring vegetable into such an amazing palat pleaser. The fish tacos on the other hand was not as spectacular. First it was not even a taco. They really need to fix the name on the menu. The ""taco"" was a wrap. There were 4 pieces and it came with fries. The wrap overall was a little too soggy. The inside was too wet. Believe it or not it was also lacking avocados! Fries were decent though. Crab cakes were not bad. The salad itself was lacking but the crab cakes made up for it.  Good chunky amount of crab cakes with each bite.I'd come back for some drinks and the cauliflower but not the fish tacos for sure..No muss no fuss sort of pub. Decorated for the holiday season, and with holiday cocktails as well, which I really appreciate! I had the burger and it was just ok, bit over done, but still hit the spot well enough. There's also a decent amount of Mexican food on the menu, which I'd be curious to try. The mozzarella sticks were delicious! I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but I'd certainly stop by if I was in the area..Very average for a New York City pub. The paninis were decent and the nachos were good..Good beers on tap. Pretty good service. Sat outside. It was nice and cozy. Seemed pretty clean. Ordered some chix tenders which were good. Ordered fish tacos- also goodHad a panini which was just ""ok""Thought they had more on the menu, Buffalo chix wrap was shown quite a bit on Yelp and was looking forward to it, but they didn't have. Beers seemed fresh. Rather small menu And they added a service fee which was annoying because I would've given the usual 20-25% tip, since service was good. But they added a fee. Just FYI.A superb sports bar that's also a local for so many people. Great food with a fine range of pub fare. Lorenzo is the main general while the guv'nor, Brian McNally is a gentleman and a great conversationalist.This bar is definitely showing the soccer match you want, all the NFL, baseball and hockey. Just ask!.great place excellent staffexcellent Bar Tender excellent food.I'm so glad this bar is still able to operate during covid. We stumbled upon it while walking through park slope. The menu was well priced and the food sounded delicious. We started off by ordering a beer and an apple cider with chips/guac. For the main dish, I got the ""BALT"" panini which is essentially a BLT but with avocado and a yummy garlic aioli sauce. It was... truly just spectacular. It was so delicious!!! We also got the chicken quesadilla and that was delicious too! The service was also so nice! Our waiter was very friendly and checked up on us regularly. Also- for whatever reason we got tequila shots (on the house!) at the end?!!!!!!!??! No idea why but we were obviously so thrilled! Thank you! Will definitely be back! :).The drinks are strong and the nachos & tacos we had were delicious. I love the high seats and this is situated in prime Park Slope Brooklyn, NY.A no frills bar/pub that's good if you don't know what you want to eat. They have a pretty decent menu with lots to choose from. Please keep in mind this place is a bar so the music can get loud and the TV is always on so it can be distracting. The few times I've eaten here it was always with family so my kid is with us. During lunch and early dinner, you will see lots of family with kids eating here so it's kind of the norm here in south slope. The chicken fingers are always a hit with kids, nicely fried without drying out the chicken. The shrimp salad is ok. The nachos are delicious but don't get steak since it's probably a cheaper cut of meat and comes out too dry. Their fried calamaris are amazing and we get those every time we come here."
"Food is good fast delivery and everything you order comes nothing missing like these other diners do my weekend spot.This place is a solid diner. I love my food. I ordered a grilled cheese with bacon/tomato and a pastrami wrap.I can't speak to the pastrami wrap yet, but the grilled cheese was delicious. And so are the fries. They were not overly oily, they give you a great portion and lots of ketchup!! I would suggest a tiny bit of seasoning on the fries. Just even salt. But I know some people can be really picky with seasoning, which is probably why they let you add it yourself. Will return when in the area!.I wouldn't quite call this an American grill. I was served beverages in disposable cups and there was practically no service and nobody to see if I needed anything during my meal. The diner was cold which didn't help.  The prices were reasonable though..Gus' American Grill was super awesome and quite affordable. Great vibes and ambience. Every single thing in the menu looked incredible, but I had to go with French Toast, it was a great meal. I really liked the service as well, they are very polite and attentive. I'm certainly visiting here soon..Ordered breakfast a few times at work with my coworkers . Fast delivery , nice menu and nice selections. Food always delicious and hot . Looking forward to trying more stuff from here.Gus' American Grill is a wonderful addition to the area. Good energy across the board. The food is incredible. Chicken Fingers - one of the best I've had. Bonus that their service is so outstanding, they are so quick and pleasant. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area..Wow, Gus' American Grill is simply pretty darn cool. Great location, great ambiance. I can not recommend Spinach and Feta Cheese Omelette more. I think every one will enjoy this heavenly food. All of the staff are really friendly - you definitely feel welcome and taken care of. Gus' American Grill... What a great spot..Very cozy place for a weekend brunch. When you sit in the restaurant you can hear the waitress (maybe the owner actually) talking and laughing with her regular guests. It's just traditional diner style American food so you can't go wrong with that. We ordered pancakes with bacon and two eggs with beef hash. The pancakes were really fluffy and they were so big!!!  Beef hash brown was pretty tasty too. I wish they have better coffee, that's the only complaint..Let me tell you, Gus' American Grill is rather darn cool. What a cute place. Great menu items, Grilled Chicken Wrap was my choice and it was really fantastic. The employees were really pleasant, smiled a lot, felt genuine. So please check it out..Wow, Gus' American Grill was simply exceptional. Clean, vibe is cool. Pretty much every menu item that we ordered was very fresh and flavorful. Professional and helpful staff. Definitely will be back."
"Food is good fast delivery and everything you order comes nothing missing like these other diners do my weekend spot.This place is a solid diner. I love my food. I ordered a grilled cheese with bacon/tomato and a pastrami wrap.I can't speak to the pastrami wrap yet, but the grilled cheese was delicious. And so are the fries. They were not overly oily, they give you a great portion and lots of ketchup!! I would suggest a tiny bit of seasoning on the fries. Just even salt. But I know some people can be really picky with seasoning, which is probably why they let you add it yourself. Will return when in the area!.I wouldn't quite call this an American grill.

"Good, solid, typical old school coffee shop/ diner/ lunchonette in Bensonhurst (you have to say it with an Italian accent.) You walk in and feel the nostalgia. I settled for eggs and bacon for lunch and it didn't disappoint. Everything tasted fresh and as if they made it for themselves. You know that extra love you put into something, well because you're eating it? That. I love places like this. Good, an ""A"" hanging in the window and cheap. Now, if every place could follow suit."
"To suggest that VIP Coffee is a VIP kind of an establishment is a bit silly considering how it fails to stand out in a hood where countless other nearby joints specialize in the same thing. VIP Coffee doesn't seem to have the Brooklyn vibey charms that many places abide by: sustainability, organic, or hype. At it's very core, it is simply affordable diner food with some Latin elements sprinkled throughout the menu. Hence, it gets a nod from me.It is a small, like a cafe with an amped up food menu. From sandwiches and pastas to breakfast and seafood, there is a lot on the menu and a majority of which is under $10. The sides scream Latin all the way, with items like yuca, tostones, fried manduro plantains, and red beans + rice. They also serve gelato during the summer months, which is a nice touch for those not feeling coffee or heavy food.Things that have worked well for me here are their turkey burgers ($9), huevos rancheros, and their meat lovers omelette ($9), which has an added component of spinach and gruyere cheese. Along with their Williams Bridge breakfast sammy ($8), it's clear that breakfast is what they excel in the most.I wasn't terribly fond of the fish tacos ($9), open faced tuna melt ($8) or their ""Thanksgiving"" turkey sandwich ($9). Something wasn't working, perhaps the ciabatta bread was too hard for my tastes but the meat was also just a tad too dry. No bueno.All that noted, I would still give them a chance down the road. There are some nice folks operating that counter, just hoping for a little improvement on the food front. At the very least, the delivery is on point..I have ordered from here twice and the food is very good. The guacamole is especially well made and taste fresh and very flavorful. I also ordered a salad with grilled chicken and the chicken was extremely flavorful and tender. (which is a hard find when tons of restaurants have dry, bland meat)Two Drawbacks. For 1 juice and a breakfast plate it was $13.00. A little steep for a not very large portion. 2: I have no proof but I am convinced that the $4 ""fresh squeezed"" orange juice is nothing more than Tropicana. The difference between that stuff and fresh squeezed is pretty obvious. And if it is, that is pretty messed up to rip someone off like that.the worst food I had in years. the delivery time was longer, than they promiced, the food was cold and disgusting to say the least. on top of that the dellivery guy never gave me my soda and when I called him he said he's too far to bring it back. Never again."
"I've only ever ordered delivery from this place, but it was A+.  Melt cheese over a roasted veggie burrito and I'm all yours.  They have just the right amount of spice and seasoning and the burrito comes with just the right amount of chips to satisfy that craving. They do lose a star because we had issue with delivery where they sent food to our neighbor and we had to call and have them re-deliver.  Honestly, that was probably as much our neighbor's fault as the delivery guy's as they never should have accepted our food..Went into this hoping for the best - but it just tasted bad. Not just tasted bad- but there was no taste at all.  I'm originally from LA, so I guess I'm picky about Mexican food but damn, it's not hard to get better than this..Not sure what all the low star reviews are about, but just tried delivery from this place for the first time and was thrilled. Got a strawberry shake, chorizo taco, and my man got an al pastor burrito. All of which was phenomenal. Came packaged with care (forgot a straw for the shake, but I'll allow it) and pretty quickly. Be warned, that burrito is deceptively spicy but very worth the burn. Will be ordering late-night munchies from this place again..They deliver late which is convenient but it's just simply not that great...not the worst,just not what should be considered worth ordering plus it's expensive and they have forgotten parts of my order before. Don't bother ordering.Do Not Order. Place is open all night long but do not let your desperation fool misguide you. This place is absolutely horrible. Bland, unseasoned, terrible cuts of meat that are so chewy I had to spit them out. I literally threw away half the food and ordered something different it was so bad. Do not waste your money on this garbage, I'd dre say the worst food I've had in NYC..I've never wanted to finish eating so bad so I can write my review. The only positive thing I can say is they deliver ""late"". I got what I thought was a pastry with strawberries and whipped cream. It was just a container of strawberries and whipped cream. It was $5. The strawberries were sour. It's one of the worse ways I've wasted $5.The burger was below average but edible. The cheese was melded to the bun so I couldn't put condiments on. I was actively excited to have a crispy fry because it was a nice departure from the cardboard that was more than 3/4 of the fries. They also only provided 3 packets of ketchup for what is considered a ""Deluxe Cheeseburger"" with fries. This might have been a punishment for ordering burgers from a Mexican place. They did this so badly I'd be too scared to ever try their Mexican. If you really really really want convenience eat at your own discretion..Solid, they deliver late hours and fast! Food showed up tasty and hot. I work late nights so to come home exhausted and find a spot that will deliver to me at 6AM is amazing.  Got chicken tenders with fries and a sausage egg cheese everything was freshly made and hot, generous portions for the price..Open all night for delivery, I placed at order at like 5:30AM by 6AM food was delivered.  Everything is very basic and bland but def satisfi the spot when you have been working all night.  Would recommend this for that food was hot delivery guy friendly.  Got a western omelette and chicken fingers with fries!!.Open all night for delivery, I placed at order at like 5:30AM by 6AM food was delivered.  Everything is very basic and bland but def fits the spot when you have been working all night.  Would recommend this for that food was hot delivery guy friendly.  Got a western omelette and chicken fingers with fries!!.Just left a birthday party and needed a taco. Could have been any type of food but it was 1:00am and we stumbled in to LA Nortena.We ordered some guacamole and chips. Not bad. The chips were crispy and not greasy but he guacamole was a little too garlicky.Tacos were the goal and we achieved it. We had salted beef and generally speaking they were pretty good.On the down side we got no water and no silverware.So it's a 3 star. If your drunk this place will do. If you're sober keep walking there is a better option.Edit: Cash only with no warning. I had to go to the ATM so a 3 star becomes a 1 star..Dear La Nortena 2,Please remove your ""posole"" from your menu. IT IS NOT POSOLE! It is oily pork broth with pork chunks and hominy. It was hardly edible and just truly offensive to Mexican food. If you can't make it, don't sell it..They are certainly not closed but they probably should be. I don't usually bother to write reviews but this place deserves an effort. This one of the worst food delivery's I have ever had. Everything that I politely asked to put on the side or not put in the food was completely ignored and the order was 40min late. The meal was cold and soggy, they even managed to leave whole bones and chicken skin in the soup I had to pick through it and just tossed it at the end. I am not sure how this place is still in business."
"You really can't beat a cute rooftop in K-town under the Empire State building! Come here for the draw of a summer rooftop and the instagram worthy drinks. The drinks were mediocre but they had some cool party tricks up their sleeve. They lit one drink on fire and our other drinks had fresh flowers, candied dried citrus slices, and fresh fruit. Great for a girly happy hour but not the place for true liquor connoisseurs. They have a limited happy hour menu (think house wine and beer). Fun place overall!.Service was friendly and the outdoor area is heated! Now on to the nitpicks:1. Food was disappointingly bar food, flatbread just reheated and not even fully hot. 2. Small selection of wines by the bottle: only two reds, Malbec & Cab on a weekday3. Cocktails were a miss too but at least starts at $14. For a rooftop bar with views of Empire State Building, I'd recommend 230 Fifth..Oof. It's been a hot minute since I've been to Cloud Social (a hot minute being when the world thought Corona was just a beer), but it appears to have gotten worse in the time since. The views were never spectacular, but now you can barely see anything as you're boxed into a clear, plastic enclosure due to the weather that limits your ability to move around freely--way too much furniture for such a small, enclosed space.The drinks took at least 20 min to arrive, despite there being hardly anyone when we were there. And they tasted awful. The Recall should just be recalled--none of the flavors worked. The margarita didn't taste like one at all. And they were out of the hot chocolate cocktail I wanted, when it was only 6pm. Our server was really, really nice, but she was also hard to flag and didn't check in on us consistently. If you want a great rooftop experience, definitely go to the K-Town Arlo instead..Stopped by here Friday night for drinks with a friend and was surprised to find that there was only a 15 minute wait time for us. We didn't make a reservation beforehand so we weren't expecting to get into a rooftop bar so quickly, especially on a weekend night.My friend and I both ordered a frozen cocktail and were surprised to see that it came with a mini chocolate chip cookie in the drink.. While this was a cute addition, we wished the cookie wasn't inside the drink because it was completely soggy from being drenched in the liquid.The vibes at this place were nice, it was quieter and calmer than a lot of other places in the city. We appreciated that the music wasn't blaring super loud because it actually allowed for conversation. One downside of this place was that the tables were crammed pretty close together and we were sat right next to two other parties with not a lot of room to move around..I would say this rooftop bar is more of a 3.5/5Pros:- Nice view of the Empire State Building - Good selection of beers, wines, and cocktails Cons:- Long line - Small venue - Expensive drinks - Very slow service ~ They give you an hour time limit, but then take 30 minutes to get you your drink. Then they come around with your check in a quick minute Overall:Honestly this rooftop bar is not worth the wait. While you get a nice view of the Empire State Building, I've been to better rooftop bars with better drink selections and better view..Avoid at all costs. Terrible set up - so cramped. Doesn't feel like an open rooftop and the view is meh. The waiters / manager are so rude it's just not even worth a conversation with people who need to get retrained in customer service. I was seated while I was waiting for a friend and they thought I was a part of larger group for some reason. I told them I wasn't so the hostess moved to me to another section. 5min later - the waiter / manager treated my friend and I poorly. Told us to get up and leave because there's actually some other reservation coming now. And just were absolute assholes. They weren't even apologetic. Let's just say, I gave them a piece of mind..Similar to the other reviews, had a decent experience but wouldn't recommend this place to friends. There's better places in the area that are worth your money! Trendy rooftop bar located in k-town with decent good view of the city. Surprisingly there was no line when we went but they were busy. The entire space was enclosed by plexiglass which kind of ruined the view a tiny bit. Clientele varied but mostly groups of friends chilling and hanging out. I don't recommend as a date spot as it's a bit more rowdy and not as intimate vibes.   Drinks were creative and funky but wayy overpriced and very limited food options. Service was typical of a nightclub/bar and it took forever to get the servers attention. Seems like they're just trying to make money vs. creating sustainable business..A few friends and I came out with the intention to visit 230 Fifth Avenue rooftop, but when we heard it was a $20 entry fee, we headed to this rooftop instead. Thankfully, there was plenty of space, as well as heaters where we were seated, on this beautiful rooftop with an amazing view of Midtown Manhattan. The Empire State Building was right in front of us. There were also all these pretty fairy lights strung up above us.There wasn't much in terms of nonalcoholic drinks and food options. I would have tried the Charcuterie Board, but none of my friends were interested in sharing that with me, so I ended up not ordering anything. The drinks that my friends got looked colorful and nice though. One of the drinks was supposed to come lit up aflame, but the wind blew it out, and my friend had to light it on fire again. It lasted only a short time.I was able to try the pita and hummus, and the pepperoni pizza. The pita appetizer did not match the photo on the menu, which showcased pita bread. What was actually served was pita chips and store bought hummus. The pizza was also not great - I think that frozen pizza may have been a better option than what was given.The service was great. The hostess and waitress were lovely. Very friendly and made sure we were taken care of. I also enjoyed the simple, yet elegant ambiance and it still turned out to be a fun night out. However, the food was definitely lacking and there's nothing I want from the menu. I would only return as a last resort..This was a great experience. Highlights: at night you have front row seats to the Empire State buildings hourly light show. The happy hour specials look awesome even though I came too late to enjoy them. The drinks are fabulous and ornate. The view is epic! The atmosphere is nice. There are flowers everywhere. Great for selfies. The one thing that they could work on is the food. The appetizers seemed lack luster. Crackers and cheese ?.Rooftop bar in Koreatown on the 17th floor of a hotel. The wait can get long especially on Fridays and the weekends. The drinks are pricey for coming in a plastic cup but do taste good. There's a close up view of the  Empire State and covered seating in case of rain."
"best chinese food. ever. FAST SERVICE & DELISH FOOD. omnomnom. i love the asian lady's drawn in eyebrows..New General Tso's Restaurant is an extremely good, and I highly recommend it. Great for a group of friends. Tried few new things off their menu, OMG. Enough said. Workers are very courteous. They're accommodating, respectful and always on their game. New General Tso's Restaurant... Check it out I say..Ordered the General Tso chicken & egg roll over the phone. $10.25 Being my first time ordering from here didn't know how long it was gonna take, delivery time was about 25 minutes. Food as far as taste did seem flavorful and gave you that comfort feeling after eating. Egg roll was small seemed like it was refried from earlier in the day & then warmed up. Yeah I'm definitely probably not gonna order the same from here again, if I decide to order again..Been going here for years, like my last post said. Food is still great, the lady is still nice to talk to and the delivery is always on time. I've tried Chinese food all over the Bronx, but this restaurant still makes the best food. Hands down. I am so glad that she's still operating through this difficult times..Love this place and have going for almost 20 years. Never fails. Lady is nice, delivery is fast and the food tastes great. No space to eat in, but still deserves 5 stars..Mediocre Chinese food. Great price. Quick service.The soup I tried, egg drop and seafood noodle soup are okay, but seems like it's missing something in flavor. That ommmft.The chicken wings are slightly smaller than what I'm used to seeing at Chinese restaurants. But it was good. The place as you can see is basically design to pick up and go, it's not a sit down and eat type restaurant although there is a small table of you needed to. (As seen in the picture)Enjoy!.I have been eating from General Tso's for years. In my opinion they are the best!! The food is always fresh and tasty. The quality of the food is good!! Their consistency is great and the food is not greasy food like other restaurants. My grandmother and I only order Chinese food from here. Overall great place to order good Chinese food!.This place is off the hook. I got the pork fried rice and general tso chicken and it's amazing the chicken was juicy and delicious and the rice was cook very well I highly recommend to any one that want a good lunch special. It's $5.75 with a free drink you can choose between water or snapple or soda.Favorite Chinese Place in town, never a question about where I'm going to order Chinese from , Fast and Good food.Goodness!! Best Chinese food I've had in a while!! They are not the politest ppl but who cares!!! Gimme more!!!!.I'm so sad. This place is only 1.7 miles (8minutes away) and after ordering - with a very polite person- they called me back and said it's too far and it will be 26 minutes. :("
"Baby Wants Candy is a full-fledged improvised musical. Several of their members are teachers at the PIT (People's Improv Theater). These people are excellent veteran improvisers who will wow you with their abilities. Even the band, the Yes Band (a play on ""yes, and""), improvises. You will be shocked at how they can simultaneously make up a plot, make jokes, make up songs, fit it into a standard musical structure, and keep track of all of it... all at the same time. It's some of the best entertainment you can get in NYC, and great for the price. Now, to be honest, I've actually seen better musical improv by a few teams at the PIT... for less price. I don't remember what they were called. So, I am giving 5 stars to Baby Wants Candy, but I'm also giving 5 stars to the concept of musical improv, which is something you should seek out if you are interested in being entertained..I seriously thought this was going to be a musical about a baby who wants candy. My friends who saw the show before even said that they won in the raffle a bunch of chocolate bars. I was so confused.In fact, I even got lost finding the theatre. The Barrow Street Theatre is the easiest and most difficult venue to find. The Village really screws around with you. I was walking up and down 7th Avenue South and Bleecker. When all else fails, use a landmark! The Barrow Street Theatre is right next to L'Arte Del Gelato.I chose 5 seats in front and as soon as my friends and I sat down, I began to panic. This wasn't one of those shows that takes people from the audience was it? My friend laughed at me and shook her head no. Baby Wants Candy, however, was an improvised musical down to the music. The band was AMAZING. They were really hip too. From cool hair to cool glasses, they weren't band geeks at all.Tonight's musical was entitled ""Swanson Broth Serenade."" It included the following hits:-I Was Poor-Cooking is like a Woman-The Stew is a Stew-The Fancy Girl Lives in Your BrainAll of the choreography was spontaneous and silly. Men played women. Women played men. White people played black people. Americans were French. Sugar was a mandatory ingredient in the stew. There were villains. There was a murder or two. Actually, does it count as a murder if the victims ended up living? Everyone had a dream. The players belted out tunes that made perfect sense in a nonsensical world. And what a set of pipes they had! Funny people can sing and tell a joke at the same time.Sadly, you won't ever be able to watch ""Swanson Broth Serenade"" ever again because it was unique to tonight's performance. Each show is different based on the audience's suggested musical. Baby Wants Candy performs every Saturday at 10:30 PM but starting May 28, their show moves to Thursday nights. Regular admission price is $25 but if you subscribe to the Baby Wants Candy e-mail list, you can get in for a discounted price of $15.This show comes highly recommended not only because it's funny, awesome, and next to L'Arte Del Gelato but because no matter what preconceived notions you may have about the show, Baby Wants Candy will throw you off. It's a pleasant surprise..This is a definite must see, if you like to be entertained in a fabulous way by a group of extremely intelligent and talented people that can turn even mundane suggestions from the audience into a very enjoyable impromptu musical evening on the spot. Saw them at the Edinburgh Fringe this week and it was so good the first time that when we left the theatre we stopped at the ticket office and bought tickets for another evening. Highly recommended. No more time in  Edinburgh otherwise addictively tempting to go again..Last time when I ran into Jody and Stewart, the keyboard guy and the guy always in a pink shirt in the show, I screamed.  I haven't screamed for any superstar since I was 14. I am a big fan of BWC and I think it's the best improv show in town. I have seen it 6 times but I still want to go. Anyway, I can't go every time or too often because laughing one hour straight will bring up wrinkles..Huh. Larious. Uh. Some.One. derful.Kuh. razySeh. see.Kuh. ool.Oh wait that last one didn't work..WOW.  I laughed, and I laughed hard.  I thoroughly enjoyed this experience.  I went to this show through Upright Citizen's Brigade, but I will be at the Barrow St performance pronto cause this shit is funny.  Funny people.  I want them to be my friends.  Go support these people cause this shit is awesome. Best $12 I spent in awhile..Seriously, almost the best $20 I've ever spent in NYC. What a GREAT experience! I went on two consecutive weekends. There were huge differences between the two shows - different humor, a different cast, different storylines, different music - and both were a blast! We couldn't stop laughing - the perfect end to my busy week. The show is different every time - and that's the best part! I guarantee, you won't get bored. Everyone needs to see this at least once!.I think Baby Wants Candy is an amazing improv show, and is a great first event for any late night in NY. I think over the past few years, i've been to about a dozen or so shows, and only a handful have been mediocre. Like any show, the actual actors are a big factor, but this show often has at least half veterans and the other half as new-but-still-funny. Any show with Peter Gwinn is usually amazing. He's one of the best i've seen and really knows how to guide and push the storyline -- but truthfully you'll never know who is going to be on beforehand, you best just cross your fingers and hope. In addition, the Yes! Band really knows what they are doing musically, which makes the whole musical aspect come together really well.I'll have to admit, some of the people are really stretching the musical aspect of the show, but all in all, the rest of the ensemble really helps to make the show work.If you sign up for the mailing list, they will email you when there show schedule is set and often you can get a discount code for tickets (usually $20 down to $15).Full disclosure: I'm OBSESSED with Baby Wants Candy. Luckily for me (and you!), they are currently performing their ridiculousy amazing show at Soho Playhouse on Saturday nights at 10, through the end of February! BWC's show is roughly an hour long, and all improvised. Which means it's freshly created, on the spot, every night, from scratch. And it's not just a show, it's a freaking MUSICAL!  With PLOT, and SONGS, and DANCING, and even JAZZ HANDS if you're lucky!  They take a suggestion of a 'title of a musical that's never been performed before' from the audience (a few I've seen include: ""Puppeteers Gone Wild!"", ""There's Something About Love In The Sewer"" and ""Revenge Is A Buffet""), and the magic begins from there!As if that's not enough, the group of 5-6 actors is backed up by a FULL BAND which is also improvising all of the music they play!  All of the performers are insanely talented and the shows are not only hilarious, but GOOD!  Their made-up-on-the-spot musicals are often BETTER (and always funnier) than scripted, written musicals!Note of caution: despite the whimsical title, this is NOT a show for children. There is guaranteed to be rampant foul language and bawdy  sexual humor. For us adults though, this is a hilarious bonus. Regardless of whether you love or hate musicals, if you enjoy things that are funny and awesome, you will LOVE Baby Wants Candy. Go see them any and every chance you get..Just saw this show last night. It was an hour of flat laughing out loud. The audience shouts a suggestion and the crew just takes off. I always want to yell something out but can never come up with anything. Luckily the rest of the crowd had no problem.The musical improv gives you a true appreciation for how fast they are creating the show off the top of their head.  But they connect everything together and somehow it all makes sense! I like not knowing where they are going with it. There was a piano player providing the music. this team has been together for years. You can completely see that in their work. There was great trust and honesty on the stage. There were time where the performers who were not taking part at that exact moment were laughing out loud. Because it is improv, it is a different show every time. It was a very fun time, great way to end a night in the city and you can bring your drinks into the show!"
"While most of the jokes in Robert Dubac's one man show ""Book of Moron"" are decidedly corny, the ideas he raises are smart, edgy, and thought-provoking. The concept of the show is that he has awoken from a coma with amnesia, leaving his mind a blank slate. His goal is to reconstruct his life and memory by doing a deep dive self excavation, which includes a search for the answer to ""What is truth?""        He calls on the voices in his head to debate politics, religion, sex and media. These inner voices (Reason, Common Sense, Inner Moron, Inner Child, Inner Asshole, and Scruples), opine about FOX News, vaccine hesitancy, cancel culture, reality TV, social media, and bull detecting, among other current topics. As the title suggests, the show is about the dumbing down of America. And though he tries at times to be equal opportunity offensive, he clearly sides with the SoHo audience who are, presumably, progressive thinkers. Should he happen to get tourists who thought they were seeing the Book of Mormon, they might just leave a bit confused and more enlightened.          Originally directed by the comedian/writer/actor Garry Shandling (RIP), the 80-minute show will run through October 3..We arrived looking forward to watching theater, not being forced to wear pandemic costumes.   Despite everyone who entered having full vaccination records,  we were all forced to ""dress up"" in our pandemic constumes despite no City mask mandates.  Virtually everyone  pulled them down when the show started....but hey, when the lights flip on, mask back up because the show must go on!.Bonjour and Konnichiwa My name is Keiki also known as ThePandaPhotographer I was at the SOHO Playhouse and I have to say, drinks are a very very limited selection. Not good choices in my professional travel experience. This is New York City so please think about a square foot per dollar in NYC, LOL. The bar area is small and seems the bartender is young and still needs some learning. ""He screws up on drink"". The bar is mostly a cocktail bar and I only like Sake and soju. IPA beer is a must and some Whiteclaws but they do not have any. Afterward, we were able to go upstairs for a small show, but something about neighbors and the noise. It was a Saturday night and I only stay for about 2 hours with some friends for a party at the Playhouse. I will not visit this place again for the drinks but will visit for shows or entertainment which I wasn't able to attend at this time..The Soho Playhouse is a small off Broadway Theatre with their own bar/lounge on the basement.  Really cute theatre.  A little run down, but the friendly and professional staff makes up for it.  Tonight I saw ""The Day I Became Black"".  One bi-racial man's heart-breaking journey of having to pick one race to identify as.  What an eye-opening experience.  Bill Posley was fantastic.  He has the incredible gift of story-telling which makes you hang onto his every word.  At times hilarious; at times heart-breaking; All the while, opening up your awareness of what it's like living as a bi-racial person.  There is so much depth to his message. He will make you think about things you never thought about.  Go see it!!Note to Trevor Noah: Have this incredibly talented young man on your show!!.A friend from Alabama bought tickets into town and I wanted to show her a bit of indie NY Theatre. So it was Dr. Jykelle and Mr. Hyde At the Soho playhouse.This independent theatre goes right in so many ways! Screw fixing the chairs that have splintered wood jutting out! They have an underground bar. Get lubricated before a show. And who needs spacious restrooms when you can cover the audience in a thick fog to fully immerse the audience in Mr. Hyde's world. All jokes aside, I really enjoyed this place. And I really enjoyed the show. I will be back again.This happened before the curfew, I promise. No more gathering in NYC after this show. This event happened weeks ago. My friend invited me to see Jay Rayner a one-man show. Although I didn't know who the guy is, I said yes to my friend's invitation. It turned out he's a good critic. Perfect! Jay Rayner's from England, so he has an English accent and he used a lot of English jokes that I didn't get or understand 100%, but I enjoyed it. Anyway, Soho Playhouse is a small event venue that could accommodate maybe 50-100 audience. Before the start of the show, the organizer/host asked to check the bar downstairs. We did and we got some nice colorful drinks. Nice bartender by the way. When it was time to start the show they asked everyone to go upstairs. The show was interesting, very different. He talked about what would be his last meals on Earth, with a touch of jokes. He mentioned about some restaurants in England, and since many people from the audience came from England, they understood it and knew some of the mentioned restaurants. Unfortunately for me I just listened and looked at the images on the slide shows. Jay's show includes his presentations about his last meals, his experiences with restaurants, his meal guessing game, and Q&A with the audience. Soho Playhouse is a perfect venue for this type of event, not too small nor big audience..I've only been to the Huron Club space located in the basement. But if you're upstairs and need to use the restroom, we'd be jostling around each other to get to them. Since I'm already on the restrooms let me start there. Three tiny lavatories (I guess that's what you call a toilet in its own room) and a cramped sink area. There's extra toilet paper in the cabinet under the sink. Don't ask. The stairs are steep and not at all ADA friendly, which is why I felt a strong compulsion to carry one very frail-looking elderly lady up the stairs. The Huron Club looks kinda shoddy to be honest. But given that it used to be a speakeasy for the Tammany Hall crowd, the scuffed up bar and exposed vents in the low-hung ceiling are ""vintage""... yeah, that'll work. But despite its looks and history, the audio/visuals and the lighting are very good. It instantly becomes intimate and cozy. There's a full-service working bar along most of the right side. Banquette seating along the left. The rest is a flexible combination of cafe tables and chairs. The theater staff are so on top of things, they will balance the table legs without having to be asked. The staff was excellent. At the end of the current show, they open the bar for service. You can order pretty much anything you'd find at an average bar. My friend and I got a little too comfortable with that and forgot that this isn't an actual bar and they would like to go home. But they never made us feel intrusive or rushed. Thanks guys! As far as this theater goes, beauty fades but character remains. And this place is steeped in character..I'd been seeing ads for the ""Rap Guide to..."" shows with Baba Brinkman for a while, and when shows have a good run it usually means they don't suck. This was a great experience! I didn't even know the Soho Playhouse existed before I came but it was a good place to check out. The venue is nothing fancy, but the show was excellent, unusual, and entertaining.Knocking a star off for the show starting about thirty minutes late. Everyone has to congregate in the bar before the show starts which is fine, but I wish we could have been seated a little earlier.I was impressed with the quality of the show and would like to return. Thank you for hosting affordable shows for the masses!.First timer! Such a cute little playhouse. It could use a little fixing up but i actually like it, telling history for how long the building has been around and what it represents!  We enjoyed the the burlesque play : Josephine Baker soo much. The actress was brillant! She captured and portrayed Josephine's  life so well. No intermission but it wasn't needed at all. I wanted more!!Afterwards we visited the little bar downstairs. Very cozy, the bartender Aiden was awesome!.I get that perhaps this place is old...maybe historic?  It seemed to have an old feel to it.I didn't spend much time....just came in and out, real fast, to see a comedy show.  Not sure if they have multiple rooms/theatres (I seemed to see another set of stairs leading down somewhere??)Anyway, I saw a show that was in the room on the street level, directly beyond the front door and ticket window where you first enter.The acoustics are horrid insofar as.....the audience chatter before the show was deafening.  Next, the seats.  I'm petite, and I felt squashed in my seat, which was an AISLE seat by the way.  Wow.A number of seats....all seats?...or at the very least MY seat, was slightly at an angle to the stage, so I had to twist ever so slightly to view the stage.Lastly, on a warm and very humid June night, there appeared to be No Air (no A/C?....no fans?).  The air in the room was 'Dead'.  Upon rushing out of the theatre after just one hour, I heard others making the same comment about the lack of air in the room.Not sure I'd rush back here to see a show??"
"Tuna belly and specially the tuna panga was superb. Plus some of the sweet delicacies aswell (bico, and brazo de mercedes)..Very poor in sanitation.  No customer service.  Rude to customers.I used to like them when they were starting as carenderia.  But as the time goes by the are losing there quality.  They have foods that are openly exposed and not covered on top of the counter.  Are they aware that we still have pandemics and Covid is rising in our areas at queens?.Outstanding Filipino and great value for what you pay.  Two entrees, rice, and a bottle of water for $7.99?  Where else will you pay that.  Delicious traditional Filipino food, and the staff is friendly..First time buying food from here. My son loves pork bbq and due to limited time I didn't order from Ihawan or Renee's and just bought pork bbq from this place. It looked delicious. But oh my, the pork was chewy as leather.Wasted $36 for bbq and all went to garbage..One of the most affordable filipino restos around woodside... They have a lot of variaties of food to choose from. They have 2 combos or value meals that you can order. Combo 1 which is $7.50 (where you can choose 2 dishes of your choice with 1 cup of steamed rice and a bottled water), the other one is Combo 2 meal for $9.99 (where you can choose 3 dishes of your choice with 1 cup of stemaed rice and a bottled water) which is what we got.For the food, We ordered Bicol Express, Dinuguan and Tocino. It was not bad for the first two dishes, but for the Tocino... the tocino marinade tastes more like pineapple alone and the meat was really really tough, that my daughter can't even bite or chew it well. For the dessert, we ordered the Leche Flan (which is really good, no lumps inside the flan. Tastes just the way how it should be. Two thumbs for this one). Almost all the desserts are $5 each except for the Flan which is $5.50. Still a good price.The resto has also other local products from the Philippines which you can buy before or after you eat. While you dine, you can also enjoy watching tv shows from the Philippines.When it comes to the staff, I think they need a little more energy in welcoming their customers. Needs to smile and greet people coming in and out of their resto so that people will come back and dine again..Buyer beware DURING THIS COVID. The guy lied to me i asked if the garlic fried rice was soft - as in new? He said YES. I get home and find it rock hard - gets stuck in ur teeth hard. If u cant get this dish right. You pretty much deserve 1 . Btw the only thing harder than the rice was the beef tapa. Spent $25.16.Came here for brunch and walked out with a full happy stomach. Located under the train you'll be whisked away by their hot bar filled with so many Filipino options from fishes to stews to stirfry all with white rice and a water.You'll be able to enjoy it on your lunch tray at the tables where you'll hear conversations in Tagalog or enjoy the news from the Philippines. All in all a filling meal for my boyfriend and I and a new spot to return to when we visit Astoria in the future..Quality of food is ok. The area where this restaurant is located has better Filipino restaurant choices. This can be anyone's last choice. I came to review for bad customer service. This place has rude servers and the owner is rude as well. Gosh I never write reviews unless it's so spectacular. And yes, this place is spectacularly rude. If I can give 0 stars, I would.. Avoid this place..With this restaurant known for it's rude staff/owner, I suggest it be renamed Baboy's Grill and Restaurant because of the owner's baboy manners..I haven't known any person that's more evil than the woman-owner of this restaurant. I suggest it be renamed Baboy's Grill to reflect the manners of the owner? Enjoy your meal somewhere else..Bugos ka putang ina mo baby! Bastos mong ugali sa pinas dinala mo pa dito sa America. Mga gago kayo! At pag sumagot ka sa mga bad reviews binabaligtad mo yung mga customer mo. Bastos kana, sinungaling kapa!.Manned by uncouth personnel who curses you on the phone when you're late in picking up your order. These idiots are ""bastos"" Filipinos who brought their kabastosan to the united states. Ang masabi ko sa kanila? Putang ina nyo! Mga gago kayo! Asal pokpok ang may-ari at cashier nito at walang modo! Ang mga putang ina dinadala pa kabastusan nila dito sa America..This is the only Filipino Restaurant I can recommend to all my kababayans who loves to eat healthy foods. Their vegetable menus are mostly pure veggies or with some a little bit of fish. Not like the other neighbors Filipino Restaurants along Woodside, which is nothing you can choose of but a bunch of fatty, oily and greasy foods including the veggies menus has meats on it.So Keep it Up Baby's Grill!BestEric de Abellana RDNCulinary Institute of Aristocratchefericuisine/instagram"
"First time outdoor with no cover dining experience...Went on a freezing day so dining in the cold was not fun but the food at La Vara really made up for it. I was pretty mind blown by the MEJILLIONES EN ESCABECHE (Maine mussels, carrot-bay vinaigrette,  pimentón aioli) dish. It was literally the best dish I had of that week.Great spot for Spanish food (I believe the restaurant is a one-star Michelin spot) by Chef Alex Raij and Chef Eder Montero.I wanted to love this place, but it fell so short:+ordered the lobster paella ($28) - not a single morsel of lobster, so we basically paid a steep price tag for a bowl of rice + mushrooms  :(+bellota jamon +artichoke ($21)  - jamon was sliced so thin you almost couldn't taste it+chocolate flan - this was just chocolate mouse with whipped cream.  Nothing flanny about itAdditionally, the bathroom was disgusting. My husband let them know and I waited 30 min to give them time to clean, but when I got there, still gross.  Nothing like having to hold your nose to wash your hands before a $250+ meal We enjoyed the squid ribbons/scallop and the beef jowl, and the staff was absolutely lovely, but the experience was so irritating and the food so hit or miss we won't be coming back.Once again, I'm late to the party since La Vara has been a fixture in my neighborhood for about 10 years and this was my first time visit.. It held the coveted 1 Michelin star for several years and I can see why. La Vara is close to perfection with their food, service and ambience. Read on why it continues to be a favorite for many patrons.Their story and food is unique--La Vara celebrates the Jewish and Moorish legacies in regional Spanish cuisine which is reflected in the ingredients, spices and flavors of the dishes.Since it has been on my bookmark list forever, we decided to end 2021 on a note  that translated to experiencing fine cuisine; I knew La Vara would not disappoint.We were lucky to snag a 7 PM reservation (and note, this restaurant is always crowded) on a milder night for curbside dining (yes, you do miss out on the ambience of a restaurant, but I go with my comfort level. Thank you Covid). The entire staff was welcoming as I perused their menu. Keep in mind, La Vara is more tapas style (for sharing) and so ordering a bunch of plates (small and larger sized) is always exciting/appealing to me.We started off with a delicious cocktail---Paved Paradise which included Green Chartreuse. A new discovery for me. This is a herbal liquor that was added to fig vodka, lime and maraschino cherry. That's it! But so delicious and pretty since it had a green tint--it reminded me of a Prohibition style cocktail.The food:*Croquetas: 4 mini truffle, leek and egg croquettes. Delicious, flavorful and not oily. Recommend!*Pulpo de Roca: Octopus, citrus and olive oil. The Octopus was sliced so thin similar to ceviche/carpaccio style. I was wishing for more after devouring this appetizer.*Pipirrana Con Grano: an appetizer/smaller plate that included Persian cucumber, green pepper, local grains,  herbs, tahini yogurt. This was superb and executed very well bursting with flavor.One of the main dishes ordered was the Rossejat which included toasted fideos (noodles), shrimp, lobster stock, fisherman's garnish, black pearl alioli, sofrito. Although it was good, I felt the noodles were a bit too oily yet dry for my liking.The other main was a special Fluke presented solo (no sides). It was pan fried and then broiled, prepared with garlic, mint and vinegar and very delicious. It reminded me of something my Sicilian grandmother would have made. Excellent but be forewarned--loaded with fish bones.Throughout dinner, our server, Jake was very attentive and would introduce us to different wine or tastings which can be ordered in a full size portion. I thought that was pretty cool.We ended the meal with their double chocolate Flan topped with fresh brandied cream. This was decadent and too good to describe.Overall, the meal was fit for a Queen/King. Not a single complaint.There are so many items on the menu I want to try the next time I return.A few things to keep in mind: Typical of most tapas like restaurants, the portions are not very big/filling. The prices reflect that but it is so well worth it.It seems their menu is updated to include new dishes and eliminate some others.Speaking for myself, I am eager to return. I cannot brag enough about La Vara--a unique experience for me on so many levels.Highly recommend!.What a cute place to get some bites and drinks:)We sat at the bar on a weekday. It was more packed and I anticipated given it was a weekday but was not too loud inside. I got the House Call cocktail and my friend got the orange wine. Both were delicious. The House Call was well balanced as I could taste Cynar and rye distinctly in a good way. The orange wine was also really interesting and delicious. We got 3 plates to share - their plates are all small bite sized. They were small but surprisingly filling. We got the Pimientos de gernika (this was okay), Ajo blanco (this was amazing, highly recommend), and the Berenjena con miel (also highly recommend)..I understand when businesses required vaccination passports to dine in back when it mandated; as they needed to to avoid fines and whatnot. But at this point they're just discriminating. I'm vaxxed and a NYC server/bartender for ten years and I can have and pass Covid just as easily as an unvaccinated guest. Won't give my patronage to self righteous Jim crows..Beautiful restaurant with great ambiance. Service is on point- Abigail was great. Menu is on the smaller side lots of seafood, minimal meat options. Flavorful nicely done dessert. Pacing of food is on the slower side. 4/5 because yes this is a tapas place and the portions are on the smaller side but overpriced. The drinks are also not that great. Food we ordered: deviled eggs- delicious must order Cod croquettes- was a little on the fence about these. The crisp of the croquette is perfect. If you like cod I would recommend ordering these. Fluke crudo- refreshing, well balanced and deliciousCorn chowder- creamy, great texture Sausage with artichokes- really well balanced dish Mussels w/ Jalapeños- one of my favorite dishes Suckling pig- if you like pork great option; I thought it was just goodDessert- almond cake & chocolate flan Almond cake alone is dry but eaten together with the cream and apricot amazingChocolate flan isn't a flan it's more of a mouse but none the less delicious wish it had slightly more salt though Drinks: sangria- too watery for my taste Wild in the streets- my favorite out of the 3 we tried; almost spicy margarita Cucumber margarita drink- also too watery for my taste.Very cute place with a nice, romantic ambiance. The service was great and the food was very unique. It was tapas, so we tried 5-6 dishes. I'd say the only one we did not enjoy was the shrimp because they had the shell and the tail on. Normally, I'm fine with peeling it off (I actually enjoy the process) but we were advised that the dish is meant to be eaten WITH the shell on, so we did and honestly it was just weird.. not in a good way. However, everything else was delicious and I have no complaints. I'm glad we tried this place and it wasn't too expensive for the amount of food we got!.Good meal, but maybe a little bit overhyped. Made a reservation two weeks in advance for a Saturday evening. Really beautiful exterior and interior--it's a nice restaurant and it appears that way. Service was solid. The server recommended 3-4 dishes per person to share, but we only ordered 6 dishes for 4 people and we still left full.We ordered a carafe of sangria, which basically tasted as expected. Ordered the anchovies, which came with a pickled grapefruit and spiced butter and sourdough. It was good, the anchovies paired well with the grapefruit and the butter, but I maybe wished that there were a bit more focus on the anchovies themselves.The octopus was good but not super special. Thinly sliced octopus with olive oil and citrus, maybe a bit like ceviche. The sausage dish with crispy artichoke and aioli was great. Very rich but really delicious. The sausage tastes great--earthy and sweet-- like you might imagine jamon de iberico sausage to taste. The fried artichoke and aioli just added more richness but it was just an indulgent dish. Slightly salty.The fideos are their take on paella, and it was great. Seafood was perfectly cooked, shrimp super tender. I liked that the fideos were slightly crispy and added great texture especially mixed with the aioli. The suckling pig was decadent. It was super tender, the skin was crispy and there was a good amount of fat paired with the meat. My main complaint was that it was 15% too salty and that really kept us from fully enjoying it. The best dish, in my opinion, was actually the scorched flat beans. They were definitely better than any other flat beans I've ever had. I can't really explain it, the scorching brought out the sweetness of the beans and it paired wonderfully with the tomato sauce.The almond cake was good but also not super special.Definitely a good meal, but my enthusiasm is just a bit damped by how expensive the meal was and how hyped the restaurant was as the best Spanish restaurant in NYC. They do have a Michelin star and deserve it, but for me personally it was a bit more spendy that it was worth. However if you are willing to splurge, La Vara is a good choice..Southern Spain will receive a 3.2 magnitude earthquake upon the realization that the distribution of flavors from the region are identical in a small candlelit Brooklyn eatery.While the menu certainly isn't for the faint hearted, La Vara takes your taste buds on a journey across a spectrum of consistency and uniqueness. I'd be remissed to not adamantly call out the duck breast and eel babagounesh, a daring fusion of ingredients that come together for a rare success of experimentation.Bring a friend, bring a date, bring an individual that has an appreciation for the unexpected, because if there's one thing you can be sure of at La Vara, it's that there's no room for the imaginable..One of my fav tapas/spain restaurant. My fav dish was the rabbit loin. Watermelon and serrano and the torta de santiago"
"So, I think I've review them before, but, they've moved down the block, to the southeast corner of 138th and St. Anns, and are renamed ""Worship Superheroes "".Best chinese food in the bronx and im not even from that area. Everytime i go to see my bff we order the shrimp and veggie fried rice with honey wings!! Their food is spectacular and perfect before a night out of drinking. In fact, im here waiting for my order to come out!.My personal fav. Have been eating from here for over 13 years. It is listed as China Cafe but it is now called Superheroes chinese restaurant. Same owners. Same food. Different name. Love those guys."
"This place is a local treasure.  Travel out from Manhattan.  It's worth it.  Take the 7 Train to Junction Blvd.  It will take you about 25 minutes from Grand Central Station.  Do the Saturday lunch in the Boros thing.  You will be able to boast an impressive familiarity with something old and real and cool amongst your friends back on the Upper East Side.Broadway Sandwich Shop (La Lechonera #6) has been dispensing exceptional Cuban Food in the Borough of Queens since the 70's.  I have had Cuban sandwiches in the best places in Miami and can attest these are as good as anything in Dade County.  Everything on the menu  is delicious and in keeping with a culinary tradition that is becoming harder to find in the city of New York. If you were recently miffed by the lack of authenticity at Floridita in the city, this is is the antidote.  If you have a car, bring home a whole suckling pig (about $100) with a few pounds of moro and yuca with onions.  Your friends will treat you like a hunter home with a kill, and they'll be right..This place used to be La Lechonera when I was growing up, 80s and 90s. They had the best Cuban sandwich ever!! No one and I mean no one, not even a single joint in Miami could beat theirs. I don't know if it's the same though. It looks like it has new owners..This place was wonderful!  It no longer exists unfortunately.  I was suprised to see it here there is another restuarant in that location.   I will miss it..I LOVE this place! I keep trying to branch out but have finally realized that this place is just about perfect. The food is always fresh, delicious, and interesting. Ive been eating here for 25 years on and off since I moved to Florida but everytime I'm back in Queens stopping here is a must. Just under the exit for the 7 train in Junction Blvd, open late and serving great cuban food. The wait staff is always accommodating and friendly and seats us as soon as possible. Even as a poor law student, I find the affordable for the food and the cozy atmosphere."
"Christian Ministry Developing with about 8  brothers in Christ from a Church in Corona Queens, their from Peru and Bolivia and we went here for Columbian food!! Service = 10Food, size portions  = 10 Ambiance 9 Price 9     I'd definatly return to this place!        It's also great for a romantic date with a lady.The staff is very attentive to the customers..I have a sentimental attachment to this place because this was one of my Dad's favorites.  I ordered his favorite breakfast which has an arepa, scrambled eggs with tomato and onions, buñuelo and tostadas.  It comes with coffee which is sweet.  It is a hearty breakfast that always hits the spot.  I also ordered empanadas, which are a must when you order from Seba Seba..Can't order pick up if you don't pay for it with a credit card over the phone. They hung up on me after I said forget it , no bye no nothing..My brother, sister and I have been coming here for years. The food quality and service have definitely took a turn of the worse. I went in yesterday and it was a complete nightmare. Only half the items we ordered were fired and when we kept asking for the other dishes the server didn't have anything to say. Whatever food he did place an order for took 40 mins to get to our table and was cold by the time it reached our table. I don't know if this is the new reality for this place but my goodness please I advise you to take your money elsewhere and avoid this place. There are tons of restaurants around the area that are good and serve the same cuisine. I will not be returning here..Came for breakfast. They are so busy that they are frazzled. Ordered egg sandwich with fries they forgot fries. Ordered empanada they forgot that too. Didn't come to see what we needed. There is no bathroom. I wouldn't return. Better places in the area..Traveling from Houston and this might have been the very first mistake we went to. The server who helped us looked hesitant to help us and got a little weird when we wanted to sit at the table next to the window. We were a bit indecisive choosing our food and finally we ordered. My husband got the bistec encebollado and i ordered the special which was grilled meat with calamares in a saffron sauce and rice with yucca. I also ordered a side of maduros which is grilled plantains. When the food arrived we didn't get our plantains and my husband asked about them to another waiter and he came back and told us our waiter said we never ordered that. Either way we got our food finally and upon eating I began to choke on the piece of plantain because I realized wherever they grilled this they must have cooked fish cause there was a couple bone pieces and fish scales. It was so disgusting and I literally get I got a piece of the bone stuck in my throat. It was horrible. Our waiter never checked on us and never asked us anything. After eating we asked for the check and my husband was very disappointed in the service. This is probably one of our first experiences not tipping because of the rude behavior from our waiter. As we were walking out he tapped me on the shoulder and asked where his tip was. My husband was livid and ready to throw the food in his face and tell him how rude it was to serve us plantains with fish scales and bones but on the contrary there was way to many people and I kept telling him to leave it alone. We left and very dissatisfied for sure. All my traveling foodies avoid this place for sure..Love this place too. Another Colombian gem. Has a bakery too. Their natural juice is amazing. Food is great. Good for breakfast, lunch or brunch. Love coming on some Sundays. Really good food, always full..Service was bad, like really bad. Took a while for our order to be taken. Took an even longer time to receive it and we even got our drinks after a few mins after our   meals. And he never came around once to ask if we were ok, or needed anything else. The place is so damn small so there was no excuse for the horrible service. We had to ask for the check several times.  My chicken was bland, dry and cold. My mom ordered steak, shrimp and chicken in some sauce and it was delicious, so 1 star for it. I asked for my food to go and  I got charged for taking my food to go lol .$0.50 a container and a damn can of soda they charged $1.75. Stoooop the madness smh. Very disappointed..This location has been here for a few years now & it's great since it's easier to get to than the one on Northern. The restaurant itself is nothing crazy small place with seating & table service. I've never sat down & tried the food it's  always just a quick bite to go. They have great Colombian Empanadas , Buñelos are delicious & so are the Dedos de Queso ( cheese sticks basically ) Sausages & Chicarón are good as well. Can't remember the name but there's this corn thing shaped like a football , it's a bit odd but it's pretty tasty. I love the Yuca empanadas these are so yummy filled with meat & so is the Papa Rellena also filled with meat but these are Chicken & potato. There's also plenty of breads to choose from the bread with Cheese is delicious. Now unfortunately all these goodies are certainly not the healthiest for u since most of this stuff is fried but they can be hard to resist. Great bakery lots to choose from prices are pretty cheap & since I always get stuff to go the service is quick. I can say I'll always be here but certainly will come back from time to time..Really great Colombian food! Plates are huge and very flavorful. Giving it a 4 and not a 5 though because waiter was OK. He forgot about one order and then another. Other than that it was a great restaurant, small location but huge meals!"
"When my wife and I order Chinese from new places we always order the same mealCame across this place on Yelp and haven't tried it yetThey are pretty decent, and not too expensiveOnly problem is their location It's hidden in the shopping plaza and I drove right past itOverall I may return But not my first choice.This is a dirty old Chinese takeout that serves inferior quality Chinese food! They're very stingy and extremely cheap with the portions they give you! They're a very overpriced Chinese takeout! It's hot as hell inside this place because they're too cheap to spend money on air conditioning! Their workers are miserable and suffering from the heat and the food must be rancid and unsanitary by keeping it in the heat too long! CAUTION THEY DO NOT WEAR ANY MASKS AT THIS PLACE EITHER! THIS PLACE IS A COVID HOTSPOT!.We usually place a big order with this place once if not twice a month for an office. Really disturbing to find a piece of scouring steel pad in the soup. Officially done with this place shows how careless they are and luckily no one ingested this piece of metal..This place is expectational. The food taste fresh-- full of flavor. Delivery time was less than 20 minutes..I don't think you in Kuo loud o o I think Urakohki ok ur looks referred I'll re right off kill.Food delivery fast, not very good, wouldn't order again, overcooked,cheap on the meat.Not first time leaving a review. This is the only place is Staten Island that offers Brooklyn style Chinese food. Always great taste. Always pleasure to eat..Received an order of chow mein with sauce on the side. Found two mosquitoes in it. Threw out $50 worth of food. When I called, the owner apologized. Never offered me a refund or any sort of compensation. I order there at least once a week and they list me as a customer..This was my favorite place for take out on the whole island    I was enjoying my pork dumpling till one was loaded with hair . I know it can happen any where but it happen to me here. Sad to say  I'll be taking my chop sticks somewhere else..Very good food. Ordered many times and it's always good. I'm from Brooklyn and it's very hard to find Brooklyn style Chinese food in Staten Island. This place cooks like top notch Brooklyn place, very good tasting, everything I order is always good"
"Solid and affordable! 2 roll combos with a gyoza appetizer came out to 45 dollars. Take out was super fast too!.Got the bento box. Price is good, but food was not the best. Teriyaki is just white chicken breast no skill with sauce. California rolls are imitation crab.Great service though!.Suma sushi came highly recommended by many, but it was just fine in my opinion. We ordered a few rolls for delivery (maybe it would be better in person?), and nothing particularly stood out. Delivery was fast and prices were good, just didn't feel wowed by anything..The sushi is good and inexpensive. The interior is just big enough for dining in, so it seems like more of a takeout restaurant..They just so happened to leave their take-out menus on our stoop on a Saturday when I didn't feel like cooking. It was good enough, but we paid a lot extra for what we got.We ordered two Bento Box specials -- one with pork katsu and the other with negamaki, both with shrimp tempura. Both came with 6 pieces California roll, rice, 2 pieces shumai, and salad. All for $18.50 each. That price was not so bad, but then there was the $6.58 delivery fee + the $1.50 online ordering fee plus tax. And then the tip was calculated on top of that total instead of the subtotal, a not so pleasant surprise for my pocketbook. (UPDATE: it appears these fees are from 3rd party service MenuStar.)I was excited that they offer brown rice since I'm diabetic , but they forgot to make that sub.  So sad, but I ate half the white rice anyway.Nicely packaged, quick delivery, ample servings..Amazing, fast, affordable. I rely on this place. Employees are so nice and efficient, food knocks me out every time. Love it!.Would not recommend it. Typical low cost sushi that entails poor fish quality and execution in making. The sushi rice was not made right too..This place is incredible! Sushi is super fresh, I'm talking about the freshest avocado I've ever had in sushi. Salmon is on point, the miso soup is bomb. My fav is the Philadelphia roll and red dragon. I have not ordered a roll I didn't like.  They are super consistent and I recommend them for any sushi cravings..OMG, Suma Sushi was actually fabulous. Reasonable rates for the area. All menu items seemed delicious, I had Shrimp Tempura and it was absolutely incredible. I became great friends with the staff, who are all fantastic and super pleasant. Suma Sushi = Amazing..Love this spot for inexpensive. surprisingly high quality sushi. I usually order the nigiri set, or the nigiri+sashimi set, and have been impressed with the fish quality every time! Also have tried the shrimp tempura roll, and I order it when I'm feeling a little unhealthy. I like it quite a bit!  It's delicious, inexpensive, and I always get my order quite quickly. Love that they have free delivery as well."
"It's a very beautiful bar they have a great beer selection if you like beers you would love it there.Racist af, some white dude with an accent a grayish beard and grayish hair and tattoos fully refused to take my friend and I's order. We didn't do anything, we walked and sit down and he fully ignored us. And when my friend said hello he mocked him and proceeded to ignore us. It was fucking weird, we left....Weird how white people will move to our neighborhood's and act like this..Cheap house cocktails ($8/9)They don't taste cheapI'm here to sip and talk. The environment is good for that..Shoutout to Liv for the recommendation and to Jake for some truly excellent service. The Evergreen serves your standards plus a selection of craft/imported items with neighborly charm. Be aware this is NOT a pub and neither is it a dive bar. It's just a local joint that you should definitely patronize if you're in the area.Pluses:HAPPY HOUR UNTIL 8 pmOPEN EVERY DAY UNTIL 4 amLots of seatingGames!Popcorn and bags of chipsReasonable prices.The Evergreen is an amazing neighborhood bar. The bartenders are warm and friendly, and the drinks are strong. There is a great family vibe here. My friend and I were in Brooklyn on vacation, and we were at the Evergreen almost every day. Its the type of place you want to go to after a long day. There is also a man out back named Marcus who grills chicken and salmon almost every night! Definitely check this place out..Walked in and the placed smelled like vomit! Bartenders are inattentive and careless for keeping a clean bar!.If you are looking for a bar to relax and has a chill vibe this is definitely the place. I personally never had a bad time here. I'm always meeting new friendly ppl here and have become cool with regulars. Music is always jamming no matter the genre.   The bartenders here are awesome and unique in their own way. Definitely one of the reasons I come here. HOSPITALITY IS ALWAYS TOP NOTCH HERE (As long as ur not a jerk)  Mix drinks, cocktails and plenty of draft to choose from. They have microwave Hotdogs, hamburgers and popcorn or you can bring outside food so don't let that make you pass up such a great place. Even the bathroom is cool. The walls are made of blackboard and chalk is available. So write, draw or just express urself. Come by and have a beerCheers!.First time coming here. Nice quaint size, lost of artist and college grads in the area. Came here with a friend to get the night started. It was days before Halloween so everyone was decked out with their Halloween gear. I loved that it was nice and warm. I was able to take my coat off and just relax. Their was only one bartender there at the time but homeboy handle his thang. Took care of the whole place and no one had to worry about getting his attention for drinks. It's a very cool atmosphere I must say, you have tissues of are behind the bar and chalkboard bathroom walls.. which was my favorite.You can order hot dogs for $3.00, a large bowl of popcorn $3.00 or chips $1... when you're drinking all that sounds good... and smells delicious!!!I have a little crush on this place!.Finally a great local bar that once you step through the door you feel right at home! What can be better than some great tunes rockin' the casbah and the Simpson's or the game on an old tube! The popcorn for $2 is a must if you've skipped dinner like me one too many times. And a great hang to catch up with your neighbors or meet some new ones along with their dog! Drink specials abound and Happy Hour goes till 9PM!! Get there now, and bring all your friends..I found this bar via yelp.  I have to say it was a very nice experience.  Out bartender, Stephanie was amazing.  Very attentive and Strong drinks.  It was my BFF bday and we didn't want to go far from home but get out and have a drink and this spot was perfect.  Very relaxed and chill.  I'll definitely be back.  Oh and the guy outside with jerk chicken hit the spot."
"Pizza is pretty good and not that expensive... Home delivery is quick if you live within the neighborhood... Pizza is hot when it arrives... Delivery people are very responsible... And sincere; I even asked for extra forks and plates... Which was not an issue with the pizza establishment.  We ordered the large plain pizza we also ordered a small pepperoni pizza... Both and then crust... Overall pretty good pizza.Love this spot!!! The staff is super friendly and you can never go wrong with the standard thin crust. The little flecks of basil throughout the pie were an especially nice touch. We also really enjoyed the mozzarella sticks!So what are you waiting for??? Come on down to Prospect Park, get yourself a couple of slices and go look at the swans across the street! You're alive, aren't you???.So I have been cooking most meals due to Covid but tonight I really wanted Italian food. I tried some place new to me and that was a big mistake. The 5 Pc. garlic knots was really only 3, the chicken on the chicken salad was over cooked and looked grayish. The chicken in the pasta was good and cooked well. The pasta was quite bland. This place was a complete disappointment..Second review bc we sat in this time.  I recommend take out. I took some out of town visitors for a taste of neighbor pizza and I got attitude from the staff. I'm a regular and to have that kind of attitude esp when someone is asking questions about their product is not acceptable. I had to ask for plastic utensils, plates, and everything else. The staff begrudgingly got it for me. I ended up w 2 large pizza, one plain and 1 fresh mozzarella, and a Greek salad. There were 4 of us and one of the out of towners asked if there was salt on the Greek salad. The staff member said yes, salt in everything here, if you don't want it, don't get it. If I wasn't with my guests I would have walked out! And conveniently their credit card machine was not working on Saturday night. All in all I have eaten their pizzas, at other times during the week I have walked there to get my pizza, white pizza usually and fresh mozzarella and they are usually courteous. But not this past Saturday night, 5/18/19. And that marks the last time I'll give them my business. RIP, lots of other establishments who are more courteous to their regulars. I had previously reviewed Bene Pizza and had said that they represented the reason I buy local and support neighborhood establishments. I still do, just not them. Lost my business..Pizza for the neighborhood and consistently good. White Pizza, mozzarella pizza and all tasty! The owner who runs it quite friendly and accommodating, always delivers on time or ready when I pickup. It may not be Grimaldi or Lombardi's but Bene Pizza is a great example of why I like going local because customer care, service, and product are so important for survival, and they got all and really good pizza..Note: this review for delivery only.It's ok. In our quest for best pizza delivery it falls smack in the middle.Delivery was fast and professional. No thrills plain packaging - I really do not mind that.Pizza itself is good. Nice taste with good balance of sauce, cheese & garlic. Pretty good crust too!What was unacceptable in this order was calamari. It was completely burned. Breading was rather heavy too, and it was burned to dark brown. That should not left the shop. But Bene's still scores good marks for pizza itself, and for great $ value. Just fix the calamari!!! I would give them second chance if they do that, no doubt..the bread has a mold on it during coronavirus time stop making people morw sick shame on you guys for selling rotten bread you guys just lost 12 customers basically my whole family.Ordered through Grubhub. Guy called right away and said they were really busy and the order would be a little longer than usual. I said that's fine. 2.5 hours later no food. I Contacted Grubhub. Grubhub contacted them and the restaurant claimed to have never received my order. So I guess order from them if you never want to get your food..This place is good. It's not the best/most amazing pizza place in Brooklyn, but it's consistently good. The guys behind the counter are nice and fast. The restaurant is clean and from I can see behind the counter, the kitchen is very clean too.Here's a great example of why they're better than most: My wife and I stopped in for takeout dinner tonight. They just had a big order come in so we had to wait a little longer than usual. They gave us a couple of cookies while we waited and apologized. That's more than most restaurants do, let alone a small pizza shop in the middle of nowhere Brooklyn..Simply put the worst pizza I've ever had, ever. Absolutely disgusting. Cheese was gross, crust tasted frozen. It seems like they just added a ton of cheap mix Italian seasoning into the sauce.So this was the 4th of July right across the street from prospect park. We were a group of 6 with kids and stroller and this place was perfect. Hungry and wanting to enjoy some shade, we went inside to an empty place (love the privacy) with very comfortable seating. We ordered a pie, some garlic knots with dipping sauce and drinks (couldn't even take a picture due to how quickly it was devoured). the workers were very kind and brought all our food to us. Nothing like a true NY pizza in the heart of Brooklyn. I'm definitely keeping this spot in my register.  For around $25 my family was well fed and ready to enjoy the trip to the park with all that energy we consumed."
"Happy Express Cafe is one of the few old school HK cafes in Chinatown.  It's got everything from overdose of MSG, crappy paper bowls/plates, to annoyed cashiers. Still, all this somehow plays to my nostalgia of Hong Kong - and, if anything, makes this place feel more authentic than it might actually be. If you're from HK and want to get that experience again, this place may be worth a visit.Unfortunately, for anyone else who are not looking for that authentic and crappy HK tasty, I don't know how good this place would be. The food is pretty low quality, and it's a pretty dirty store overall. It's got no decor, no service. Perhaps one thing that it has going for it is the price, so many this place is worth a visit too if you're looking for some quick and cheap eats in the area..Did they recently switch owners? I feel like the quality of food has significantly gone down. I used to come here every week pre covid, and food was always delicious. However, my recent trips have been disappointing. I usually either get the satay beef spaghetti or the porkchop/chicken chop spaghetti. The past few times I've gotten these, the spaghetti were over cooked and soft to the point it felt like baby food. It's such a shame because I've been a regular for over ten years, and suddenly the food no longer taste the same. I now only visit if i want a HK style sandwich like their corned beef and egg sandwich and/or hong kong style milk tea. which still tastes fantastic. Hopefully this is temporary and they can bring the old quality of food back..I was in the neighborhood..Around 3:15pm..I ordered chicken spaghetti For take out..Price $7.50Used to be around $5.50.They give u a lot ...8.12.18 Sunday2day I eat over here.i have chicken fried spaghetti with ice lemon tea.Spaghetti is $6.95 beverage $2.50 total $9.45 Spaghetti used to be $5.25 beverage used to be $2 Everything is expensive now I don't come here often U eat here don't have to pay tip.There aren't any very (good) HK style cafes around. I had this place bookmarked for a while, and I happened to be in the area, so I went to pick up some lunch on a Friday afternoon. I made it just in time for the lunch specials, which is until 11:30. I really wanted some of that HK style macaroni soup because it seemed like a very comforting food for a drizzly and cool day, like the day I went. The options are (A1 - Ham w 2 eggs) (B2 - Ham, hot dog and egg), (C3 - Ham, spam, and egg), (D4 - Spam, hot dog and egg) with your choice of a hot coffee, milk tea, and lemon tea. I went with C3, but they didn't have any macaroni (what??) so I settled for instant ramen noodles. I forgot to take into account that I was getting takeout, and wouldn't be eating it until at least half an hour later, so I forgot the noodles would be soggy, which they were. The noodles had soaked up most of the broth, AND they jipped me of the ham! The salty MSG broth did hit the spot though. But overall, definitely not worth $4.50 for some bouillon broth, instant noodles, one slice of spam, and one egg.  I ordered my husband the baked pork chop with cheese over rice ($8.95) and it was REALLY good. In fact, I ate more of it than he did. They use fried rice as a base, which has curry powder in it. It's a huge dish and it's pretty oily, so one can only eat so much of it. I must note that a chin-mask worker was rinsing spaghetti with his bare hands, like he was hand washing laundry - so I had to just look away, be thankful I didn't get anything with spaghetti, and pretend that they didn't handle my food the same way. But then again, it's a hole in the wall in Chinatown. You can't expect much. Spaghetti masseur aside, I don't think I liked the food enough to come back. But it's definitely a good option if you're in the area, and are just looking for a quick/cheap way to fill up..I used to like this place until they decided to rip me off today. I was overcharged for Chicken Spaghetti with Black Pepper Sauce and they didn't even give me any sauce at all. Now I'm left with some bland chicken and spaghetti. Ridiculous. I want my money back..Wide array of tasty Hong Kong staples for a budget friendly price. I've been coming here since 2004 when they used to be at the store next door. Food has been consistently on par since. There's lots to choose from; rice, noodles, sandwiches, Now if you're just looking for a snack.. they've got a pretty length selection of appetizers as well, like onion rings, mozzarella sticks, curly fries, chicken wings, fried wontons, popcorn shrimp, etc.They're cash only. Enjoy!.A great take out place for breakfast but they also serve up lunch items as well. Located in Chinatown this is definitely a cash only spot but their breakfast won't cost you much.I always have their breakfast combo because its a big serving of food along with a drink such as hot tea or coffee. They're always popular in the morning, catering to the elderly and the parents who need their children to grab a quick bite before class.Having been around for a long time, they had changed their name to happy family cafe, I assume it is cause they cater to the families. Will be grabbing breakfast here when I am craving more of a Hong Kong style breakfast..Came here for breakfast with my husband on a Saturday morning. This place is definitely better than the S Wan Cafe we went to last weekend. Like all cafes we've been to, they all serve a variety of HK style Cantonese food and drinks. We ordered the iced HK style milk tea, curry fish ball instant noodle, an order of curry fish balls and preserved vegetables & pork vermicelli. All the breakfast items are pre-made except for the eggs and toasts. Our order was ready within 5 minutes. As far as taste goes, the HK style milk tea didn't have a strong tea taste, was diluted and watery. The fish balls were pre-made and then microwaved when you order it but it was still good and tasted great with the instant noodle. The preserved vegetables & pork vermicelli was alright, the broth can use more flavor and a few pieces of the preserved vegetables were hard. Cha Chan Tang makes it the best. I recommend coming here if you're around the area and looking for a quick breakfast place. There's plenty of seating and they have AC and a bathroom..Breakfast sets are a huge thing in Hong Kong and I always find myself missing Hong Kong breakfasts like this where you get a drink and some sort of noodle dish or egg sandwich. I went to Happy Express Cafe on a Saturday morning by myself and ordered one of their breakfast noodle sets. It was simple and cheap and it filled me up. Don't expect much here. This food isn't fancy and of course you can make something like this at home but you come here because you DON'T want to make it at home. It's food that your Chinese mother made for you on those early mornings before you went to school. I've only tried their noodles here but maybe next time I'll try their Spam and Egg sandwich. No Fuss, Simple and Cheap..Came here because I was too lazy to go to my regular spot and regretted it.  The food is really mediocre and it is normally more expensive than some of the other places that sells the same things.  In addition, they gave us the wrong order.  Giving us ham instead of spam.  Please note spam is more expensive by .25 cents, so they placed the order right but when it came to giving us the meal it was wrong.  We just left it because it was just .25 cent. No apologies whatsoever though."
"Of course it's not the famous one. But it is:-damn good-I can customize it. Yes, I'm the heathen that eats Hawaiian pizza. And I can get a Hawaiian slice here, with an order of garlic knots (good garlic knots, not the dough rocks I've had at some places) and a drink for pretty dang cheap. The pizza itself is always served hot, and the bottom stays crispy all the way through the slice- no sogginess here! My fiancée would say that their meatball subs are also good- in fact, we make a trip from close to sunset park pretty frequently when he craves this meatball parm. And they're always open, which gains stars in my book. Overall, it's a good, solid, classic joint. Don't expect TOO much and you'll be more than pleased..Worst place ever I use to like this place I dont know who runs the show now but I called for a pie of chicken pizza that was 24 dollars and I asked for crushed red peppers and the girl on the phone said it was 75cents each it's not about the money it's about the point that she told me it's free when u come into the store because it's out of a bottle but not free for delivery that was ridiculous I will be going to smilling pizza from now on.Had the $4 white slice. The service was quick and decent. The pizza was loaded with ricotta and beautiful ny chew. There was a small space to sit in the back to unwind for 30 mins..Good New York pizza, great people. Honestly one of my favorite pizza places in the city..I placed my order with Yelp and it was accepted by Joe' Pizza that was at around 11:45 and it was due to arrive at 2:03. At 2:30 I called Yelp because although the app was supposedly monitoring the order and let them know what was going on. They called and asked if I wanted to keep my order and that Joe's Pizza would fill the order fresh and send it. I was happy. But when my order arrived at 3:30 the pizza and the Buffalo wings were cold and the zeppoles were missing. The only good thing was the soda was cold. Here's the rub I only ordered delivery because I couldn't leave the house to pick it up but I literally live 5-6 blocks away!  This gives Joe's Pizza no excuse for delivering cold pizza! And missing part of the order. I love their pizza and think they have the best pizza around but I will be looking for a new spot..My boyfriend got a few slices of BBQ chicken pizza from here yesterday, 5/31/21, in the afternoon for lunch (around 1pm). Only thing he ate that day. Got food poisoning a few hours later. Spent 3 hours over the toilet. Yea...not fun. Not sure if it's related to the cleanliness of the place, expired ingredients, or raw chicken. Either way, you have been warned..This isn't the same as the Joes in the city. I am sadly disappointed. Pizza tastes like the way it does after you microwave it 3 days after it was sitting in your fridge. Very soggy and stale. We need better pizza places in the heart of park slope..If I could give 0 stars, I would. Such a rip off. Go one block over to peppinos or smiling pizza on 7th Ave or table 87 on 4th Ave.A very solid slice joint, especially if you need company while walking home drunk. The plain slice is hefty and crispy. The Sicilian is fluffy and oozing with cheese on top. Exactly what you want in a Brooklyn pizzeria..Do you have kids?Do you take those kids to JJ Byrne?Do you have zero time in your evenings to feed those kids dinner?Enter Joe's Pizza.  Good but not great, however in a fight for survival of me vs my kids, I'll feed em pizza from here 5 days for the week if I must.Dad of the year. Right. Here. folks..."
"Festive Spanish restaurant that serves home style food. Friendly place to go eat and dance.  I was craving plantains and couldn't decide if I wanted sweet or savory so I got both maduros and tostones. It was a good decision. I was surprised to see this gem hasn't been added to Yelp yet..During my exploration of this ethnically diverse area of Queens, I decided to try something different for lunch.A quick peep into this restaurant revealed a lot of customers who looked Latin American - settled. When I walked in, I felt like being in one of the old western movies where everyone turns to look at the new stranger in town. However, the customers soon returned to their chatting.The menu was actually quite diverse with some quite expensive steaks available for the hungry but I was only after something light at lunch. As I'm not very familiar with Latin American food, I got a recommendation and walked out with some arepas - crunchy fried dumplings, which was perfect for my appetite.A good local eatery judging from their custom, most of it repeat by the looks of things"
"This is your typical Dunkin' Doughnuts. Fast service makes it easy to grab a coffee on the go. Their iced coffee with cream and sugar is good: not too dark not too sweet, but it verges more on the side of dark than sweetened. Their doughnuts are like any other establishment in this franchise, but good all the same. As part of the Baskin Robins/Dunkin' Doughnuts co-franchise, they also have good ice cream if coffee or doughnuts aren't your thing. Friendly, helpful staff makes quick trips fast and easy.If you need a place to work, it can do in a pinch if all other coffee houses are filled, but for those who are bothered by lack of atmosphere, this won't be a place for you to work since it feels more like sitting in a fast food restaurant than a café..Service is unfriendly, but quick.I guess they talk about you if they make your drink wrong.Disappointed that the brand ended their dark coffee blend as It brought me in to their stores.Price for coffee is fair..I made an online order once a couple things but, ordered two orders of hash browns and I had my brother pick it up.  One order was missing.  I wasn't mad, everyone makes mistakes.  Today I ordered a couple things but they forgot my bagel twist.  I call them and I have to pick it up, im upsetbut its not a big deal.  When I get there i ask was it warmed up?  Can it be warmed up?  She said yea yea she did.  Lol no it wasnt Im pretty sure I'd feel the warmth plus is was so hard.  im not the type to write reviews but in the past id dealt with bad attitude and now this?  do better.Very slow. Always a line. They need more help. Always see customers without masks on. Today there were two and the store servers said nothing. I understand that they don't want to get into a confrontation, but it is law and it endangers other customers..Came here today around 12:50pm the store was completely empty and quiet. The cashier didn't understand my order although I was very clear of what I wanted, took about 5 minutes to order two things. Asked to scan my membership card cashier gave attitude as if it was too much to ask. Won't be returning to this location..What the heck is this cause these aren't Dunkin' donut fries. Soooo disappointed. Looked nothing like the pictures..This Dunkin' Donuts is probably one of the worst I've ever been to. They constantly mess up your order and tell you it's because you said it wrong. Please explain to me how I said croissant and got an English muffin?? I only come here because it's on my way to work but otherwise I would never come back..When did the donut selection get so small? Not too many donuts to choose from. Even the Baskin Robins ice cream selection is small! What happened to the other flavors?? Sign of the times!.Terrible Terrible service.  Average wait time for a simple Coffee 5 mins with no customers in line.  You figure with no line and pre-made coffee pots, adding milk and sugar shouldn't take long.  Guess again.  Staff is incredibly lazy, manager does not oversee, just a overall terrible store..I come to Dunkin for the Boston Creme because lets talk about doughnuts worth eating. Long story short: they seriously skimp on the chocolate. This Dunkin is dead to me."
"THERE IS NO COMPETITION!! Let me start off by saying that I consider myself a bit of a ""Chinese American Cheap Fast Food Takeout"" connoisseur.  Yes, I'm very familiar with great authentic Chinese food as well, but the cheap local americanized hole in the wall is what I grew up on and I'll never let it go! And with good reason, some of these dishes are simply fantastic when done the right way.  And that's where we get to Spring Garden. My oh my where do I start.... I still remember the day I googled ""Best Chinese Food in the Bronx"" and there, about 10-20 pages in was the obscure listing for this Gem in the wall. ""Top 8 Chinese restaurants in America"" the same words on the decrepit looking banners barely hanging within the walls of the restaurant. I figured this was some kind of paid advertisement but nonetheless I indulged the flattery. When I first tried the food, I wasn't completely sold. I didn't get it. I could tell it was definitely different from your typical take out spot, but I wasn't sure if it would make me deviate from my regular spots. But that's the beauty of Spring Garden, it's almost like Champagne. Until you've had the full range, you really don't know what is or isn't good yet. It wasn't until I moved to Brooklyn, that I realized what I had in front of me all this time. Don't be fooled by the glitz of Williamsburg or the newfound glam of Astoria. When it comes to that delicious local 'B Rating on the window or less' Styrofoam plate Chinese food, Nothing comes close to the Bronx.This shop is run by a husband and wife and I'm pretty sure they handle the entire operation, from cooking to delivery, by themselves. So I highly suggest you pickup unless you want to wait 2 hours for delivery. If you do wait the two hours, still worth it. See Below...The Goods:General Tso ChickenI came home to visit my parents one day and me and my lady decided to order some Chinese. We got an order of the General Tsos. About one hour went by and the delivery still hadn't arrived. We called about four times after that and every time they would tell us 15 more minutes after two hours of waiting, the delivery finally came. I should have been so damn angry... but that chicken was jus so damn good. This has to be one of the top 5 General Tsos in New York. And trust me, I've tried ALOT of them. It's perfectly crispy, you can order it with white meat if you're a heretic, the sauce is fantastic. Everything about it is perfect. You probably will never find a crispier General Tsos anywhere in NY. I'm not even sure how they do it, I've driven a plate of these bad boys all the way to Brooklyn and it was STILL completely crispy. It's a marvel of science. Chicken w/ BroccoliI evaluate every local Chinese restaurant via 3 central dishes: General Tsos, Chicken and Broccoli with white sauce, and Chicken and Broccoli with Brown Sauce. Spring Garden nails all three excellently. The key to their Chicken w/ Broccoli is that the chicken they use is battered and fried before hand. And the results are incredible. Sure this is all probably bad for your sodium levels, but damnit it's delicious!  Their broccoli is usually crisp and fresh and nicely cooked. Both their white and brown sauces are excellent. And because the chicken is fried first it has wayyy better texture than your average Take out spot. None of that gooey mush here. The Fried Rice:They also have superb fried rice. You would be surprised how many places get this wrong. Spring Garden fried rice is always well cooked, has great flavor, and you can tell they don't use rice that's old because of how the grains stick together. It's almost like sticky rice that's been pan fried. Stay away from any chicken fried rice, they use the same battered fried chicken in the fried rice which doesn't work as well without the sauce. This review is long enough as it is, so I'll just cover those essentials for now and review some of the other dishes another time. But you honestly can't go wrong with those three homeruns.  Don't take this place for granted BX! This is about as good as local Chinese Take Out gets..For a local Chinese spot not bad. If I don't want to cook I'll grab something from here. The food taste decent and the cooks seem to be clean and efficient. If you want delivery be prepared to wait a while.Don't go here expecting a 5 star meal nor the most sanitary conditions; it's a fast food spot, not a sit down restaurant people. That being said, the food is decent in my opinion and better than the various chinese stores in the area. They have a nice space as well, usually chinese stores are small and cramped but its spacious in here and you would feel like your space is being invaded if others come in to order food..This place is an excellent restaurant. There are 3 Chinese takeout places on this block and I've tried them all. The food here is always cooked very well. They are an extremely clean restaurant and every time I go in the floor is always mopped. Plus you can see into the kitchen and see that it also clean. I ordered a large pan of wings here for a party and they put fresh oil in and cooked them fantastically. I also notice that the owners have a very nice attitude and are very pleasant with customers. For a takeout place this spot is on point!.Best Chinese in the area. Very clean in there, not much that meets the eye but the place is unbelievably clean. Delivery is slow but worth the wait..I live around the corner from Spring Garden. Never venturing in because the window is so foggy, I assumed it was a dump. Well it IS a dump, that makes excellent food.If anyone that represents this restaurant is reading this, the place needs an intensive make over. The atmosphere turns people off/away.Lets talk about the food: I always try a new restaurant by getting a soup, an entree and a 'special'. When I opened the bag gorgeous smells hit me like a bouquet. And I knew I hit pay dirt when the soup noodles were FRIED (easy heart, easy boy)This was a year ago, I've since pretty much stopped going to Boe Lee I'm sorry to say. Prices are better / food is great.Pros: Everything is good! No foolin. Never had a chunk of mystery meat, or grizzle. Portions are filling. Prices are what you would pay anywhere, sometimes even less. But the quality is what I'd expect in a much nicer, sit down establishment.CONS: This place looks dreadful. One dirty  table. And three awful chairs, missing chunks of foam. I literally walked in and directly out twice before taking the plunge. A box lined with a trash bag, serves as the trash can. You can do better Spring Garden.Food is 99% on point. However, if you go too early on a Sunday ( 30 mns after open) you have a good chance of getting last nights rice. I suppose that is not a huge deal, but this food snob takes umbrage at dry rice. Special Note:There is an online ordering page. Don't use it. The owners don't check it / know how to use it. So your order is essentially 'sitting there'. Call it in & if you're a local, pick it up. One delivery guy, so up to an hour wait. If you are frustrated by second language learners, use the menu and circle items. I've seen a few pissed off customers complaining LOUDLY. Must try: Sweet donuts: think zeppoles with granulated sugar. So addictive.Cheese Wonton: savory not sweet! Wrapper is very good as well.Any soup: the fried noodles are basically crack.Enjoy and don't judge a book by it's cover!.Ordered delivery because Burger Time was close, Pine is $$$ and I'm over Domino's, Didn't read reviews or anything. This place happened to be open and I lovedd every little last bit of grease in my delivery food! And you will too!Eat it while it's hot! And never eat left over Chinese food..Bad taste. Burned rice. I don't think I have ever had such a disappointing Chinese in my life..Although the taste of the food beats the other fast food places in the area it really means nothing when this place should be shut down due to the grossly disgusting conditions in the restaurant and the people who maintain it. The minute you walk in there are two HUGE holes in the ceiling with mold all over them, which is bad for food and if DOE walked in on that alone, they'd be shut down. But if you somehow missed that, let's talk about how I returned my food one day AFTER waiting twenty minutes in the restaurant AFTER calling it in on the phone! Again, return my food because the man burned my wings so bad that the entire chicken was black & purple AFTER I BIT INTO MY FOOD(bc I tried to give it a chance anyways)... this man really took my food back with an attitude AND THREW NY PICKED ON AND CHEWED FOOD BACK IN WITH THE CHICKEN WINGS READY TO GO OUT... WHAT?!? Mannnn... he lucky I didn't call DOE the minute he did that. And the only reason I didn't was bc I know that business supports their kids. Otherwise.. I'm NEVER eating here again, if he got the nerve to do that in my face, image what's happening when you're not looking. Ha! If I could give this place zero stars I would!.Hidden gem. Great place to get my fix for authentic Chinese take out."
"Got the basil chicken for takeout and it was delicious. Veggies were nice and crisp, chicken was tender and the sauce was very flavorful. Super delicious and would for sure come back again..First time trying Wanisa and I am intrigued! The menu definitely has more variety than your typical Thai spot, and the servings are quite generous. We ordered pickup and were impressed with how carefully the packaged everything to the point where the food still remained warm after a half hour commute! Out of the 3 dishes we ordered, one was a true winner for me, another was a classic done well, and the third was in the not ordering again category.- Winner: Crispy Pad Thai. With its crispy rice noodles, crispy pork rinds, and a deep fried egg, this dish was the better alternative to the classic pad thai. Each bite had a crunch, the chicken and the shrimp were both delicious, there was lots of peanuts in the dish, and the egg was so tasty! I truly enjoyed every bite of this dish. The pork rinds were a bit stale from being out for a while, but the rest of the dish was delicious and made me want to come back for more.- Classic: Red Curry. The curry sauce was perfect and the chicken was cooked well. I love that they put eggplant in their red and green curries. We asked for it to be spicy, and we got exactly that. I am so glad that their spice levels were generous. - Not a Fan: Crispy Spring Rolls. There was something in the sauce or the rolls that just didn't taste good. The spring rolls tasted different than those from other Thai places, and not in a great way, but it may have just been a one-time occurrence. With multiple other dishes to try in the menu, I am not too concerned about not ordering this again..I was pretty hyped when looking through the menu deciding what to to get - loved that there was a good selection for 'specialties' and definitely appreciated suggested wine pairings for a few items in this section.My Lychee Ice Tea was a pretty weak in taste but my friend's WK Hazelnut Thai Tea looked better.I ordered the Shrimp Paste Rice. Not a dish I've had before and it was.... interesting (it came looking like a deconstructed fried rice dish). I liked how there was a variety in ingredients but the ratios were a little off - the small serving of rice wasn't enough to eat the fatty Chinese sausage or sweet pork. Even if I mixed all the components together before eating, it  was still too fatty of a dish.My friend ordered a Pad Thai and the portion was HUGE (her plate was 2-2.5x the size of mine). It did come with topped with a pretty big piece of crispy egg omelette (which was a little burnt).Overall, I found my experience to be pretty underwhelming. Not sure I'd come back for a second try..Finally tried Wanisa for Thai delivery!We ordered the Thai dumplings, spring rolls, pad Thai with ground chicken, chicken satay, and beef pad see ew.Delivery took about 45min to Brooklyn Heights. Everything was very well wrapped in cellophane - they really put a lot of care into the packaging!Everything was tasty - the Thai dumplings and spring rolls were ok. The real highlight for me was the pad Thai with ground chicken! I loved this combo, abs it was some of the best pad Thai I've had. Will definitely be ordering from Wanisa again soon!.Pretty average restaurant, especially at a slightly higher price point than many other Thai restaurants in Brooklyn. The Massaman curry I ordered was a bit bland and got a bit tiring while I was eating it. The Thai tea was fine, although didn't taste too much like hazelnut even though it costed extra for the hazelnut flavor..They have amazing Happy Hour specials!! I had the house wine ($5) and Pad See Ew, soup and spring rolls. Thoroughly enjoyed everything. Excellent location, right off the Bergen St stop, close to Atlantic Ave..I am very torn about this one because the restaurant is not bad and the flavor is okay too but I have a fly in my curry and that is in anyway not acceptable AT ALL!I was inspired by BY THE GOOD REVIEWS ON yelp and decided to give a try.  I ordered three dishes for pickup and it didnt take them that long.I tried the roti with curry- the flavors are not bad though the roti is bitter in some parts because its burnt. The mango sticky rice is fresh. The bummer is the Penang Curry! Thank God i took a detailed look before digging in because there is a wholesome fly dead in the curry ( I guess it liked the curry too).While i think the flavor is decent, the restaurant really need to up their game for food quality check and having a dead fly in the food is simply awful. Hope they can make some changes to this..Came here for lunch specials with my work team. Their food is delicious! Their massaman curry was the best I have ever tried. I finished it all! They have outside dining and inside dining. When we went around 1pm it seemed we were the first guests of the day.So our group's issue was this.. My supervisor asked if we could replace rice with veggies (any veggies.) The waitress stated-that would not be a problem. Also, my supervisor asked for all our salads to be larger than their lunch specials and she stated she would pay more. The waitress nodded and sweetly said the kitchen would do the changes. Sooo... all our plates came with rice and the salads were regular small sized. -__-""The food was delicious, but there was miscommunication somewhere...Quality Thai food, at a steal of a price. The dishes here were so good, and the portions were unbelievably generous.Meat was cooked well (chicken AND pork), and veggies tasted fresh and crispy in the sauces. None of that soggy pre-made business. Definitely a good find in the area, worth a trip for a meal in a fun part of Brooklyn!.Wanisa has definitely made it on my go to list to get Thai food. My boyfriend & I went at 6pm on a Friday & sat outside. They have 5 (?) tables total outside the restaurant - 3 are in a covered stall & 2 on the curb. We got the shrimp rolls & fried tofu for appetizer, both ordered pad kee mao (extra spicy), and a bucket of the Mui Thai punch.Appetizers - both solid & perfectly fried. loved the dipping sauces. Shrimp rolls were 5/order for $9, tofu had 12pc/$7Pad kee mao - this is always our go to - the noodles had an amazing texture and had a perfect bounce/chew to them! We asked for it extra spicy and they definitely delivered - we could see all the Thai chilis they added. If you LOVE heat, we recommend! I think next time, we're going to try it withoutMui Thai Punch - the bucket is so cute but to be honest I didn't like it that much - It tasted like hi-c fruit punch mixed with some cheap tequila lol. I'd still give their other drinks a try next time. Overall we left happy and full - definitely come check it out!!!"
"I came in to this restaurant with a friend of mine who lives in Brooklyn and he was able to purchase a Groupon for dinner for two here.The wait staff was very friendly and we had a nice selection to choose from utilizing our Groupon.I thought the food was extremely tasty and this is definitely a restaurant I would be going back to. Which really surprising to me is there was hardly anybody in this restaurant. Considering I'm somebody that doesn't really like Indian food, this place is really worth a try.We came here for dinner upon reading a yelp friend's modest review. Although the reviews that we read are mixed, we thought it was still worth a try.We came here on a Tuesday night. Aside from a couple of diners by the window, we practically had the whole restaurant all for ourselves. The phone and the computer tho are making announcements every few minutes that there's an online or delivery orders.The restaurant is immaculately clean. The tables are adorned with proper table settings. The waiters are friendly and attentive.We started with a glass of Pinot Noir and ordered poppadom just for nibbles. It was served with tray of sauces and chopped spicy onion. We ordered chicken tikka masala. I found the sauce delicious but slightly thicker than the ones I tried in the past. The chicken Bhuna is a lentil based curry and the sauce is as thick as the masala. Both entrées was served in a copper tray with Basmati rice and Nan bread on the side.When we asked for the bill, the waiter came back with complementary sweet rice pudding dessert.I am glad that we came and dined here. The dishes did not blow me away but it's delicious and comes with fresh ingredients. The customer service and over all cleanliness is commendable..When my husband and I were in the Brooklyn area, we saw this restaurant and decided to check it out.  We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, which were boneless broiled chicken cubes, cooked with a special tandoori mild sauce.  The dish was so flavorful - the sauce was thick and creamy, and the cubes of chicken were meaty and juicy.  I was surprised as most of the Tikka Masala dishes I've tried lately were watered down and were not seasoned well.  Wonderful fresh naan bread with a side of their basmati rice made this a perfect meal.  The service was great, and I would love to go back and try out their other specialties.  Definitely check them out if you're in the Brooklyn area!+Chicken Tikka Masala :D+friendly staff.If you want quality indian food this will not be the place. Personally i didn't think it was bad to the extent that it deserves one star but my fellow coworkers will probably think otherwise.My coworkers decided to grab lunch here and it was a disappointment. All of my coworkers are indian so they pretty much know quality and none of them were impressed. We got the banana pakora which was not what any of them expected. It came out as round balls instead of flat like a banana? This was actually pretty decent and we finished most of this dish. I got the chicken soup and it was okay. I have nothing to compare it to so i'm not sure. The assorted tandoori meat platter had somewhat dry meats and we didn't bother finishing it.Vegetable vindaloo was okay i'm not a huge fan of spicy so this wasn't a hit for me. The chicken vindaloo was the same my coworkers felt it was only okay. I liked the butter chicken but i'm afraid only cause it wasn't that spicy and the chicken is boneless. The chicken tikka biryani was okayThe best part of the meal was the garlic nan. It definitely satisfied my carb craving and of course nan goes well with food or alone.We got the rasmalai for dessert and it was interesting. Again my coworkers were not impressed and did not really like it. The service was okay though! but that is probably cause we were the only people in the restaurant...I feel like as a person that doesnt often eat indian food i would have eaten here and thought it was average since I don't have a lot to compare to. But my coworkers were not particularly impressed and some actually thought it was some of the worse they've had. They even assured me that this is not what good indian food tastes like. Needless to say we will definitely not be returning for future group meals..After a walk around the neighborhood, Hungry Boy and I came her for dinner. He had purchased a living social deal and thought it would be nice to try some place new. The restaurant was pretty quiet on a Saturday night, but it did have a few tables. The server were all very friendly and attentive. Ambiance was pretty quiet and dimmed.For complimentary, they gave us papadum, a thin crispy bread with different sauces. I loved the green sauce! Through the living social deal, we were also given white wine, which was pretty good. For appetizer, we've tried the coconut poori, which is deep fried poori bread stuffed with shredded coconut. This poori was full of coconut flavor and was not too sweet. It reminded me of gai mei bao (cocktail buns), the ones you find at Chinese bakeries - only these were crispy and less doughy. We also ordered fried chicken wings that comes with ketchup. The wings were really crispy and it tasted good by itself, but it tastes better with the green sauce.For our entree, Hungry Boy gotten the lamb vindaloo. This dish was delicious! I absolutely loved the spiciness of the hot sauce and it goes really well over white rice. The lamb were very tender and full of flavor. As for me I've gotten the tandoori mixed grill, which was only okay. The kebab and the beef were very tough and chewy. The entire plate came with 1 piece of shrimp, which was overcooked. Honestly, out of the entire entree, I only liked the chicken because it wasn't overcooked, dry or tough. Maybe, I made a bad choice and was greedy to want to try everything in one entree. I mean the vindaloo was really good and perhaps a masala dish would be good too. As for dessert, I've gotten the kulfi, a home made ice cream with pistachios. This ice cream had a good taste and texture. The server also gave us one complimentary coconut rice pudding, which was also really good.Overall, not a bad place to try. I mean after all, they were all very friendly..Terribly disappointing.I went there after seeing their lovely window curtained exterior and had decent hopes when I saw how well all the tables were set and that I got the restaurant all to myself for lunch.Unfortunately, it was all downhill after that.The waiter (conveniently?) forgot to give me the lunch special menu, where a meal comes with a choice of Pakoras, a soup and an entree with rice.The Banana Pakora was passable-- but I didn't taste any banana in it, mostly bready fritter.The soup was surprisingly good-- creamy and well-blended Mulligatawny, which didn't have too much tomato in it.But the entree was terrible. My Chicken Korma was completely overcooked-- dry as a sheet of paper and really thick, and the sauce just tasted really flour-ey (as if they just poured it out of some mix with water) and there were no almonds or raisins in it at all.And the basmati rice was also a bit overcooked and dry.Worse was that they were out of rasmalai dessert.So in summary: Pretty setting with a few passable small dishes, but possibly the worst entree ever and service that was lackluster at best.I doubt I'd ever return to this place again..I only gave them a star because I've had some good meals there and there's no 0 star option! Now closed, thankfully. Don't go to the replacement, it's probably the same people. All in all, they are completely impolite and service is bad. I will be using somewhere else for India food from now on!.**Review for a pick up order**Lapin and I passed by and I decided to stop in and order some take out. They had a special dinner to go for $16.95. It included samosa & pakora, a main course, rice with dal and naan, three condiments and dessert.There was only one waiter and he looked stressed. The phone kept ringing with orders, seamless orders kept printing out more orders and he had roughly 6 tables. I got the special dinner option. He didn't allow for much customization but instead of the chicken curry I got the Chicken Tikka. We had to wait almost 30 minutes for my food to come. The deal included a lot of food but the flavor and quality was a bit lacking. The samosa and pakora were average tasting. The chicken tikka came with almost no sauce. It was super dry almost like it was left over and reheated. The rice and naan was okay. The dal was watery had barely had any taste. It went down the drain. The condiments -- meh. It was tasty but too watery.  The dessert --- what a joke! The container firni came in is the same container Chiptole gives for salsa or to put hot sauce in (Hale and Hearty also gives the same container for hot sauce as well). After two spoonfuls it would be gone. I never had firni before but it was very watery and had one or two ""strings"" of coconut (I am praying its not the pre-package ones you bake with). It was average tasting but I didn't finish it.I feel a bit disappointed to give such a low rating since it nice to have an Indian place so close by but I wish they would improve on the quality!.Went in for a lunch on thursday, the place was empty so we got the best seat in the house :) Nice ambiance in the restaurant, totally typical of indian restaurants. I had a shrimp tandoori which was super savory, the naan is bomb too. The side sauces are yummy too.. I will definitely visit this place again and recommend it to my friends.We used a groupon  to purchase the meal and it well worth it..Already annoyed with this place before I even received my food....I came here because I bought a Groupon deal.  It was in the neighborhood so I figured I'd try it out. I notified the waiter that I would be using a Groupon and he immediately started trying to get me to buy other stuff that wasn't included. ""Get naan bread."" ""You don't want an appetizer?"" After I informed him that I only want the entree and included drinks, he said ""ok you know you have to tip on the full $51 amount, right? Not just the price of the Groupon."" -_-  I had to let him know that 1) I am very familiar with how to tip when using a Groupon & 2) that I didn't HAVE to tip at all. He apologized profusely and he went to put my order in. The food was ok. I've had better. He tried to make up for it by bringing us complimentary desert (rice pudding) but I was already turned off by that whole exchange.I probably won't return."
"Excellent buffet. Having taste tested a lot of NY / NYC Indian restaurants I can say that this is up there / if not the most tasteful (a bold statement coming from a Brit that knows good Indian food). Also not greasy at all.As Ravi the waiter explained, the owner is actually the one cooking the food and has a strong track record in the area. Ravi himself gives a level of service rarely found in restaurants let alone during weekend buffets.Wish I had found this earlier but I'll be sure to be back - with my father from London..Absolutely love this lunch buffet. They have a variety of options, including chicken tikka masala, paneer, samosas, and naan. The price is pretty good for the buffet too because it's all you can eat. Definitely try to come early though because since it's a buffet and the food is kept warm with heating oil cans the food might be a little colder than you want if you're coming at a later time. It's a large space and I like that the space always smells like a really soothing incense (but if your nose is really sensitive to spice smells it might be a little strong for you). If you're not coming for the lunch buffet, I definitely recommend the chicken tikka masala, which is delicious..Great night out!  Came here with a group of friends for a birthday and we were accommodated to the fullest extent!  The waiter surprised us with a few appetizers of his choice and they were great!  Everybody I was with ordered something different - I had the masala Cheese dosa. It was a thin crepe stuffed with cheese and potato, fantastic!  It came with a lentil soup which was a little on the spicy side and was really good!  Ordered some garlic naan and cheese naan which were great with our meals.  Highly recommend this restaurant!.Great place for Indian food in LI. I came here couple times for the buffet on the weekend. It's always pretty quiet, very pleasant atmosphere and good service. I just wish there was more of a selection of food but I have been to another indian buffet and they had the same number of dishes, I guess it's always like that. I remember when I came like 2 years ago, there was lamb as one of the dishes in buffet, but haven't seen it since then.And the last couple times I've been here, the only meat was 3 different kinds of chicken. I love chicken, but wish at least one was a different kind.They always give you a basket of naan. It's freshly made and very tasty!.Absolutely delicious and authentic Indian buffet. I was here for a Saturday lunch buffet and the place had plenty of seats so didn't have to wait at all. For $10.99 lunch buffet even on weekends they offer quite a nice selection of lots of curries and stews. Their Naan was definitely one of the best I've had at an Indian restaurant, so very fresh and warm fresh out of the oven. We did had to wait a bit for the naan basket when we sat down but the wait was definitely worth it.Service was really good and I never once saw my water glass empty while I was here. The decor is quite nice and modern too. Even with few larger tables of patrons it was never noisy and I really quite like the ambiance music they play in the background. While the food selections are pretty standard and I wouldn't say different from what you find at a typical Indian buffet place, they're done quite well. I even go for the bastmati rice where normally I would skip out on rice to save room just because the rice is such a good complement to all the dishes. I was a bit disappointed not seeing any lamb entrees but for the price its well worth what you get. The rice pudding (Kheer) was another favorite of mine, very rich and creamy that I kept going back for more.From reading the menus online I didn't realize they had offered buffets so everything has been a very pleasant surprise once we sat down. Although its a bit out of the way from the main roads (347) I definitely think its well worth the trip if you ever come out to Suffolks. Definitely one of my favorite Indian restaurants topping many of those that I've tried in the city.I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of flavor and level of service Raga possessed. Why, oh why then, was it empty at 8:30 pm on a Saturday night???East Setauket, do you not know what an Indian food gem you have right in your freakin' town?No need to travel to the bowels of Hicksville for good curry or vindaloo!You'll enjoy a little sweat on your brow while feasting on the Chicken Saag served mild. Other standouts were the onion stuffed kulcha and the aloo tikki chaat, the latter being the best appetizer I have ever eaten at an Indian restaurant. Seriously! All I have to say is this place better be packed the next weekend my ass ventures out to Port Jefferson!.Best Indian food in the Stony Brook area. Yes better than Curry Club or whatever other place you can think of. The chicken tikka masala actually tastes like the real deal here and comes with actual white meat chicken. And unlike SOME places, you don't get a huge bowl of sauce with just 4 pieces of chicken - you actually get a ton of chicken/meat with the gravy.The naan here is EXCELLENT. If an Indian restaurant is able to bake a naan right, then you know they have a solid tandoor oven in the back. Maybe thats why their meats here taste so good. Next time compare the naan from curry club and this place and you'll see what I mean. The naan here is fluffy, fresh, with a slight buttery taste.Service is great. The owner is very friendly and hospitable. They DO cater btw!.Still my fav for amazing Indian food! Have not found a better place! Very fair prices and very friendly staff..This was our first time eating here and we totally loved everything we ordered! We had the fried cauliflower appetizer(GHOBI CHILLI) and the fried mixed vegetable appetizer(MIXED VEGETABLE PAKORA). For our main dishes we ordered from the Tandoori Sizzlers section and had CHICKEN TIKKA and from the seafood section we had SHRIMP TIKKA MASALA. Both were the best we've ever had! We have eaten in many Indian restaurants but this is the best! Even the coffee was good! We didn't have room for dessert. The garlic naan was perfect for dipping! This is our new favorite place and we'll be back often!.Pathetic Indian food! Buffet was made up of old food. Inedible dishes. Not sure how Yelp rating on this restaurant is so high.BTW I am Indian, if it matters..I have ordered from this restaurant several times, but my most recent experience inspired me to finally leave a review. I've tried three dishes here: Dal Makhani ($15), Vegetable Vindaloo ($15), and Bhindi Masala ($13). I really enjoy their Dal Makhani and Bhindi Masala. I wouldn't be able to speak to the authenticity, but I found these dishes tasty and big enough to split into at least two meals. Based on these two dishes alone, I'd give Raga 4 stars. However, I my most recent order of Vegetable Vindaloo was less than stellar. There were lots of very hard, inedible objects in the food (I attached a picture). I found these hard pieces in literally every bite and had to spit them out. I think some of them were spices, but others seemed to be shattered pieces of something nonorganic. Whatever they were, mining through piles of my own spit up was hardly appetizing, and in the end I was too worried about breaking a tooth to finish the dish. As for the rice ($2), it was tasty, but there were also several whole cloves and an entire cinnamon stick mixed in. It was easy to avoid these hard objects since they were in white rice, but in the thick, textured vindaloo? Not so much. TL;DR: Avoid the vindaloo and save your teeth."
"I had this unnatural craving for tasty Indian food. Perhaps in part from the heat and New Delhi-like climate settling over South Brooklyn. Upon returning home I found a menu from Brick Lane in the gate. It said Grand Opening on it. Certainly this  must have been some sort of eastern karma thing. There were higher powers at work..  I ordered with low expectations I must confess. I'd been burned in the past...The food was damn good. The tandoori was perfectly marinated and moist. The breads were appropriately buttery and flaky. The spice was heavy handed but on the money. Everything was freshly prepared and authentically seasoned. Damn! It was kinda cheap too. The menu seemed too big to be really good, but everything I ordered was spot on..They have a pretty big vegetarian selection too.....if you are into that... Cant wait to try them again. Fast and friendly delivery guy and the fella on the phone was extremely polite. Heck yes..Buyer beware - this is NOT the same Brick Lane Curry House chain found in the East Village! I'm almost surprised they can get away with copying the name, typeface and logo.I got to this restaurant because of an Amazon voucher. My girlfriend and I were excited thinking that the real Brick Lane Curry House might be opening up a chain in Brooklyn. So we rushed over to the restaurant to find only two other tables were occupied in the entire restaurant on a Sat night. First sign of trouble. We ordered the Samosa and found it to be stale and greasy - sign of a store bought one that was fried and served. Then we ordered the Chicken Tiki Masala and Chicken Balti curry. The Masala was overly creamy and sweet. It started to clump up as it sat there because of the excessive cream. The Balti was flavorless and simple, but not in a good way.They can plagiarize the name, but that's the only thing that's similar to the real Brick Lane Curry House. We won't be coming back..The worst Indian food I've ever had in NYC bar none.Always want to try out a new (or revamped) restaurant in the neighborhood but the food was either tasteless or terrible.The saag paneer tasted burnt and the dal was totally flavorless. Even the sauces were lacking in flavor. Very bummed that the old restaurant (Mumbia) went down hill with this latest incarnation..OMG!!! Horrible would be too kind of a word to describe this place. When you first walk in from the street, this place seems pretty nice, they have dim lighting and flowers on the tables. But I soon discovered that this place is Food Hell!!!! I DO NOT recommend this place if you have never had Indian food! If you are on a date! Or if you want to treat yourself to something nice, only come here if you want to tell stories to your friends about the horrible food and service. So whats soo bad about this place, lets start with the menu, it is ridiculously long with no descriptions of the food, and terms that non-indian speakers would not understand. 1 example "" Assorted Tandoori, Papadum, chicken tikka, boti kebab"" this was the description of one dish, there are soo many words in there that I didn't understand that there  was NOOOOOOO way that I would know what I was getting, except for the chicken! I should have ran after that, but I decided to ask the waiter what things were, but several times he said that he didn't know, or told me that he couldn't explain it, so I decided to phoned my friend who is Indian and read a few of the names to him and he broke things down for me which was REALLY helpful. I ended up getting the Malai. When my food arrived, it ended up being a small bowl of yellow curry and a VERY large bowl of plain white rice.  As soon as I bit into the chicken curry I immediately regretted every walking into the place. The chicken was soo dry it was like bitting into a large chunk of chalk or left over thanksgiving turkey. It was sooo dry that it kept getting stuck in my throat when I tried to swallow, it was also flavorless, which to some could be considered gross in curry dish!  When I told the waiter he ignored me and went on his way. I finally decided to ask my waiter for my bill which ended up being a little less than $20 ($20 bucks wasted!) I decided not to waste anymore money and paid with my debit card WITHOUT a tip :-( And here is the kicker! when the waiter saw that I didn't leave a tip he stopped me on the way to the door and questioned me angrily  ""Where is my tip!!!"" and I told him ""The chicken was awful how do you expect me to leave a tip when the food is bad!""  He then went into the back and began cursing out the cook, while customers looked on. I was humiliated! This was literally THE WORST restaurant that I have ever eaten at! Normally its either the food that is horrible or the service that is horrible, at this place IT IS BOTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Beware!!!!.I wish I could give this NO stars. My boyfriend and I ordered in since we wanted Indian and knew of no places in the area and were absolutely starving so we blindly ordered from seamless. Let's just say that the meal was mediocre and was not worth the horrible food poisoning we both got hours later and had to go to Cornell (yes the Upper East side from Cobble Hill at 2:30AM). Oh and we didn't even order any fish or seafood...I mean really, I think it was the samosas or the naan or maybe the rice or even his curried veggies. Anyway, never again..The food is disappointing to mediocre. The lamb dish is good and fresh, the veggie dish is a let down. They use frozen peas, and way too many peas so you cannot find out the taste. The Mango Lassi is juicy, its supposed to be like yogurt. Not recommended for folks looking for the same quality Brick Lane in Manhattan..As a Brit temporarily in NYC, I was suspicious about this London themed place, but went in for their $9.99 buffet lunch and it was amazing - surely the best value in the city - and terrific quality. A total surprise. However ... finding myself there last night, a different story. Food was pretty horrible. My fave Sag Chicken just lumps of mediocre chicken tossed in tinned spinach, no depth of flavour at all. Tandoori roti, OK-ish. Starter of fried cauliflower, which I'd had in the buffet and was superb, was revolting at dinner. Worst was the price, which was $44 with tip for a quick one starter, one dish, roti and a small beer. So a great place for a bargain lunch, but avoid in the evening..I've been to this place a few times when it was called Raga and it was adequate.Since they changed names, I assumed they changed owners so we tried it out.  The food is still adequate, nothing special, decent prices.  I probably would have gone back on occasion but for an error with the order that I find unacceptable and unforgivable.I ordered the assorted Indian hors d'oeuvres and noticed on the menu, there wasn't a vegetarian option and as listed on the menu it included a chicken item.  I requested vegetarian when I placed the order.  After I paid and was getting ready to step outside while the prepared the food, I turned around and said ""Please make sure there is no meat in the appetizer""  (much like if  you order decaf coffee and you're not certain they were paying attention, you might stress the point.""  The man said ""No Problem""Got the dinner home and there was chicken in the appetizer.  I immediately called and they were apologetic but kept insisting that the chicken comes with the appetizer.  He didn't give a damn that I had ordered it without and had confirmed that there would be no meat.  Finding meat after that was disturbing and I won't be back.So, if you're a meat eater, you will find this place has completely acceptable neighborhood Indian fare.  If you're not, you might want to avoid it.This neighborhood doesn't have really good Indian Food.  I guess  I'll keep truckin' to Jackson Heights to fix my jones..This is my go to neighborhood Indian spot, and I love it... and I eat indian food 6 days a week.All these other yelpers talking about how its not the same brick lane as in Manhattan...great! It's not. Brick Lane in Manhattan is a BS scene spot.  Some of the best onion pakoras in the game; the vegetable kurma is awesome; and the condiments are top notch.True, it is always empty.  It doesn't really matter because i always get take out.5 stars.This is excellent mid priced Indian food. I've been going here for years when it was still Raga, not sure why it changed names? Maybe there's new owners? Anyhow, you can't go wrong with Brick Lane, classic Indian food at a good price, the guys that work there are very nice and they deliver. Enjoy."
"Lowkey, this is the best pizza place in the gramercy,  kips bay area. They use the right proportion of cheese and sauce. And their pizza pies  always arrive hot.Price wise this is a $$$ restaurant but that price Tage comes with exceptional taste. They sell slices (cheese, pepperoni, Buffalo chicken, etc) garlic knots, Stromboli,  sodas, canollis.Mike's has seating inside, if you want to stick around. They also offer delivery. You can probably find them on seamless, or gurbhub, or ubereats..Do yourself a favor, don't ever order from here. Except for Mike the manager, the rest of the staff are mean, inconsiderate and surly. And if you decide to order, don't ever place it through Doordash...another clown show.The order is never received...probably because Mike's is as tech-savvy as a corpse, and less responsive. Do you're a favor if in the neighborhood...order from La Vera on Third Avenue and 26th. Much, much, much better pizza and a warm, inviting staff..Not the most appealing pizza slices I have ordered. I came into this shop a little before 10pm as it was the only pizza shop that was open this late. Upon seeing the slices available, I can already see that the pizza were poorly made. It appears that they just throw the topping on and hope the cheese would nicely melt over everything. It was very unaesthetic to look at, but luckily they tasted just fine. I got two slices of the buffalo chicken which ran me for $9.75. Definitely better options in the area which will cost less and made better, but again, there's not many options during this time when there's a pandemic happening.The service on the other hand is fine. They love to joke around and are for the most part friendly people to chat with..My pizza loving self feels so fortunate to live in New York, where your average hole in the wall pizzeria like Mike's puts out a slice that's tastier than a gourmet pie anywhere outside New York. I know that makes me sound like a NY pizza elitist but I am fine living in my truth. Mike's has been around for decades serving the local community with fast service and a wide array of slice options. I've had dozens of slices from Mike's but I think they've always been a classic plain slice with plenty of oregano, garlic powder, and pepper flakes on top. The crust is crispy, the sauce is flavorful, and I always leave deeply satisfied with my [often] late night slice that only costs $2.75.  NY Pizza, never change..Solid 3.5 stars. Its good, consistent New York pizza. The sicilian is my personal fave. I tried the carrot cake. Bad move. The carrots were shredded but not finely shredded. It felt like I was chewing on thick coconut and it was way too much/overpowering.  the cake tasted raw and undercooked and the cream cheese frosting tasted like pure sugar.  Next time, I stick with the pizza only..Some of the worst pizza in all of NYC. I ordered 2 cheese slices ($2.75 each) and my total came out to $9.75. I told the cashier that this couldn't be right but he insisted it was. When I said I was not going to pay for it, he quickly changed his mind and said the total was $5.75. I would not be surprised if they have been overcharging for a while. Bad pizza. Bad and immoral employees. Mike's pizza is lucky there is no option for 0 stars..Nice and convenient average pizza alert! Mike's is a fine pizza joint and every slice I've had has been pretty good,  although not very memorable.I do appreciate the array of toppings for slices though. They usually do a few combinations of veggie slices which is super nice! **Cue all Kips Bay vegetarians**Last night I got the broccoli mushroom slice for $4.50. Other nights I've gotten different veggie combos-- whatever they made that day. Stop here if you're walking home from work and need to nip that pizza slice craving!.Ohhh this has been one of my favorite pizza places since I lived in this neighborhood. The owners are wonderful and all the workers are so respectful and I'm so glad it has been around all this time so shout out to them and go eat from them.I was first introduced to Mike's over five years ago after a date at the comedy club across the street. Little did I know I'd a) move to this 'hood and b) this would become one of my go to spots. Sentimental details aside, Mike's makes a really good, cheap pie.It's rare I stray from a medium pie with a topping which will set you back 16 bucks. The pie itself is simple and straightforward with a really excellent crust. I'm one of those weirdos who usually ends up with a crust graveyard on my plate, but Mike's is actually worth eating. It's got a nice crunch and chewiness to it. Some other menu standouts are the garlic knots, minestrone soup, and mozzarella sticks. I was honestly so surprised by how good the minestrone was. It's 4 bucks for a standard side soup serving, but it's filled to the brim with fresh veggies, garlic, and penne. It's perfect if you're not feeling so hot. Although I've tried their calzones and pastas they weren't worth ordering again. Kinda bland and unmemorable to be totally honest.Mike's has been a neighborhood staple for so long the phone number on their box doesn't even have an area code. As long as they're still around it'll be my go to for no frills slices..NY Pizza. When you're looking for it, you want just that. Not LA pizza .. Not North Carolina pizza.. You want that big, lil greasy, seasoned, cheesy, hot and tasty slice of pizza. So I would recommend stopping in and getting a slice here. Not only are they friendly, they follow covid guidelines too."
"I really want to give it more of a 3.5 stars.This is an elegant yet surprisingly quiet and quite empty restaurant. My friend and I came here for dinner to catch up and enjoy a Friday night. The service was impeccable. We were originally sitting outside, but half way into our first glass of wine... we both were quite bitten up from the mosquitoes outside. The waiter was really nice and changed our tables so we can be indoors. All the dishes were plated beautifully. I especially loved the scallops that were pan roasted atop a cauliflower puree... it was beautifully seasoned. However, I was quite disappointed with the Bistecca steak. I ordered it medium and it was cooked more like a medium well. It was also really bland and lacked seasoning all over (so I took 1.5 star away). I was adding the salt and red chili peppers that came with the bread between bites to hopefully give it some flavor.Prob won't go back....This is my second time here. I did not give a review then as could not judge them well due to all but one waiter being pulled due to a last minute fashion week party.  This time there was no party and due to late hour only a few other guests. It is often just before kitchen closing so seeing staff at their most tired. Our waiter was five stars as dealt with my ignorance of not know what pepperonata was.  The food surprisingly was not as good as last time. They took an amazing veal dish off the the menu. That is curse of my companion that the dish they love is removed when come back again. My tuna tartare was good and steak was well cooked. Apple tart was nothing amazing. Scallops also did not blow away.   Place I am sure stays open based on hotel food but since such a nice place I wish they would bring back veal. Hopefully can also keep staff..We had a group of my good friends here for my birthday party and had a really good time. The space is modern and funky on the outskirts of the main drag in Tribeca.  We arrived a bit early for our reservation and sat at the bar for a drink. The bartenders were very accommodating and quick to whip up our cocktails.  We had a group of 10 and there is a back room that is separated from the rest of the place with some glass doors. Very cool! We were there early, and as other reviewers have pointed out, this place is still ramping up, so there werent too many other people there.  The food was tasty and fairly priced. The waitstaff had their hiccups but held their own for the most part.  The hotel where this place sits is pretty cool.  They have a rooftop that we were able to hang out on and will rival any others like it.  A real gem..Where should I start? The buildout is nice and this looks like it would be a good place. Outdoor patio like a lot of New York eateries. It's worth noting that they would be well served by investing in a bug zapper on the patio. The preponderance of flies has you thinking you're either near a dead body or a dumpster. Literally, swarms. Maybe this is part of the atmosphere though. I ordered the prosciutto and mozzarella appetizer and the server recommended the house burger for my entree over the rigatoni.A WHILE later, a gentleman brought me out a kale and cashew salad with green apples and I think a yogurt dressing. The salad was okay. Would have been better had I actually ordered it. I never got the prosciutto and mozzarella.15 or 20 minutes after finishing ""my"" salad, the burger arrived. It might have been good had it not been burned beyond all recognition and so laden in salt that afterwards my mouth felt like I fell asleep face down with my mouth open on the jersey shore at high tide.I'd wash the salt and charcoal taste out of my mouth, but my glass has been empty for the last 35 minutes. I'm waiting for the bill now which is good because it's given me a good 10 or 15 minutes to write this review. Fairly certain that if I started walking, I'd make it to the state line before they noticed I was missing..Service was extremely good on our Valentine's Day visit.  The menu was preset  so our choices were limited with regards to the menu.  My husband ordered sea bass which he seemed to enjoy but I did not like the tortellini I was served.  It was overly salty and for the price, we just didn't feel the portions were adequate.  However, the Hotel Hugo bar above the restaurant surprised us with the most spectacular view of New York--breathtaking!.I'll admit this is my first Yelp review and the first time I was really compelled to write one given that the reviews so far are very positive (which influenced my decision to go in the first place). Details below, but in summary: Overpriced, bland food with a waitstaff that's still getting their act together. Cool venue though.Food: Our appetizers were fine, mediocre at best, but seriously overpriced. They all reach the $15-20 range, but are quite tiny and unexciting (we tried the prosciutto & mozzarella, veal meatballs, and a half portion of the farro fusilli which was very dry). My entree (agnolotti) seemed a bit like frozen ravioli though, and the sauce was unappetizing. My boyfriend's dinner (lobster tagliatelle) was horribly fishy, to the point where he sent it back (which I have never seen him do once in over 3 years). He suggested the chef taste it to see where he was coming from, to which one of our 800 waitresses came back and said ""The chef says it tastes fine to him"". I thought this was quite rude and defensive, especially for a $30 bowl of pasta.Service: They are clearly still trying to get it together. At least four different people came to take our orders at various points, and I still wasn't sure who our waiter/waitress was by the end of the night. There was a pretty big celebrity there at the same time, so I'm not sure if we were just being neglected (that's what it felt like) or they just aren't organized yet. Venue: Is nice - it's a cool, trendy spot, high ceilings, nice decor, etc etc, which is why I threw an extra star in. Also, going to the bathroom is an adventure - you have to leave the restaurant, go down an elevator (which is still set up for contractors), and walk past the hotel gym. Then when I took the elevator back up, I was locked out of the restaurant. Luckily, someone let me back in. My boyfriend wasn't so lucky and had to exit through the hotel lobby, go out to the street, and come back through the front door of the restaurant. Really?!.Lovely restaurant inside the Hugo hotel. Great food and service, all the waiters were very knowledgable about each dish. Get the octopus appetizer! Also the lasagna bolognese has spinach infused pasta and the spaghetti with clams is a must. Would come back again..This wonderful new soho gem really has it all! Beautiful decor , fantastic cocktail program, incredible food!Located inside the Hugo Hotel , it might seem a little hard to find initially, but once you are there , you know it was all worth it.This italian inspired restaurant offers skillfully crafted drinks , masterly prepared dishes  , menu featuring your italian favorites !!! Try the octopus for an appetizer, the agnolotti with nettle and the duck!  Bottom line! I really enjoyed my dinner @ il principe!.I like this place, great food, good ambience, very comfortable place for a weeknight happy hour/dinner out with friends. I really like that the wait staff seat you, serve you, and let you take your time the rest of the way. There is no rush to move you out. The food is quite good. I ordered the Pan Seared Scallops (fantastic) and Cheese Plate (very good) to follow. Next time, I'd like to try several from their Antipasti menu..The service was poor and not accommodating to say the least. Fair food at best, to many places to eat in Nyc to waste special moments."
"A cozy spot in Saint Marks with the most delicious Japanese crepes! I was soo impressed. The crepe is crispy, not like the usual soft ones. They make it in front of you. There's both sweet & savory crepes, we well as bubble teas. My favorite is the Matcha Chocolate Truffles crepe w/ strawberries. The truffles were amazing, i'd get like a cup of them on the side. Also pictured: Savory smoked salmon w cream cheese and spinach crepe..Got a few sweet crepes from T-Swirl while we visit NYC. Pro:- yummy and pretty crepes- opens late- friendlyCon:- small place and very limited seating- take a long time to fulfill the order.-Got some good ahh crepes-Wide variety to choose from-Thicc crepes-Good place for dessert.To say the least, I'm addicted to these crepes. I go every week or any time I am around one of the locations. I've only had the sweet crepes but they also have savory options. The crepes are 100% rice so once they cook they get this delicious slight crispiness to them. It's so good. And the best hot right out of the store..T-Swirl Crepe is a small store amongst many on its busy street. The restaurant was completely empty when I came in, but the staff was really attentive and friendly.I got a rather basic crepe consisting only of nutella and strawberries. It was basic, but solid and delicious. They have a lot of options, but I was opting for something light after eating a heavier dinner. I thought the size was a little underwhelming, but some of the more intricate crepes seemed to be larger in size..Rather than waiting years to get into Spot Dessert bar down the street, we opted for T-Swirl. We thought we were ""settling"", but were pleasantly surprised by a very cute little dessert shop that has very kind staff. I loved all the options, from sweet to savory. The crepes are made fresh, the portions are huge, and the ingredients are high quality! The Mango Deluxe was AMAZING. I loved the combo of fresh and dried mango. It's the perfectly refreshing dessert for a hot summer day or night. The Lychee Romantic had some unique flavors not found at other dessert spots. The rose cream was a subtle background flavor that's incredible with the fruit and crepe..These are easily some of the prettiest crepes that you can find in NYC! I got one sweet and one savory: the vegetarian and the wild berry. Both were really really yummy. The only caveat to this is that because they're so intricately crafted, they do take a little while longer than you might typically expect for crepes. So, just make sure to build in a little extra time. But you won't be disappointed!.T- Swirl Crepe puts an interesting twist on crepes. It's not your traditional crepe. It's prepared like a traditional crepe except used with rice flour. After it is stuffed with yummy goodness it is then folded and stuffed into a cone which is great on the go! It's very trendy and tasty. You can get savory or sweet and they have so many variations. I sure wasn't disappointed. All the servers were super friendly and adjusted our cones when some of the fillings were falling off.Holy Crêpe I was indecisive, I had the following-T-Swirl Fruits Cocktail CrepeSliced strawberries, sliced bananas, blueberries, raspberries, mangoes, custard cream, whipped yogurt, crushed pistachio and chocolate pearls.Matcha Chocolate Truffles CrepeSliced strawberries, chocolate truffles, matcha custard cream, whipped yogurt, chocolate sauce and crusted pistachio.Spicy Crabmeat Crepe Crabmeat sticks, Mesclun Mix, Masago, Seaweed Salad, Cucumbers, Edamame (Soy Beans), Crunchy Shallots, Avocado, Seasame Seed, Spicy Mayo, Sesame DressingShrimp Avocado CrepeShrimp, fresh avocados, baby spinach, julienned carrots, red peppers, shelled edamame (soy beans), chili Thai sauce and wasabi tofu sauce.Smoked Salmon CrepeSmoked salmon, cream cheese, baby spinach, capers, red onions and string beans.Crepe Brûlée.The service great and friendly. There were two tables inside and a couple outside for customers, but the tables outside didn't really look comfortable nor clean since it is one level lower than street. The crepe itself was pretty underwhelming. I got the chocolate banana crepe: the banana was fresh, the chocolate was sweet enough and that's about it. Nothing unique and memorable. They have some savory options too but we didn't order those..This place deserves more 5 stars and more reviews.If your in the St. Marks area , you need to try this place for dessert. It's probably the best crepe style dessert I've had. Back in LA there was this place called Millet Crepe and I use to think that was the best place for Crepe Dessert but T-Swirl just kicked that out. The crepes here still manage to be sooo crispy. Every bite had a crunch. They were very generous with the toppings. Every bite there was a strawberry. I definitely recommend adding the additional vanilla gelato, it's just a great combo with chocolate.Also my friends Crepe something with matcha cream I can't remember, but they legit gave actually whole prices of chocolate truffles like how amazing.Oh only downside the cashier lady was kinda just over her job haha but it's fine, it was a Friday night and she probably wanted to be out and about."
"Great service and great food! I've been looking to explore more of the bars in Woodside. I pass Saint & Sinners twice a day since I pass it to go to the 7. When I got there Johnny, the bartender, asked if I was there for dinner and I said yes. He handed me a menu and the specials of the day. He then asked if I wanted something to drink. I got a Smithwick as my first beer. I ended up getting the steak egg rolls as an appetizer and the California quesadilla for my entre along with a Sam Adams as my second beer. The egg rolls were great. You get 4 of them and a side of chipotle aïoli. The quesadilla was also great and the veggies tasted fresh. That came with a side of ranch. I noticed that on tonight's specials they had berry cheesecake for dessert. I also asked Johnny for a dessert cocktail recommendation and ended up going with an espresso martini. Both the cheesecake and the espresso martini were fantastic! Jonny, despite having about half a dozen customers at the bar, was very attentive to everyone and has great hospitality! I will definitely be coming back in the future and bringing along friends!.Good local place to grab a beer and some food. Vegetarian/vegan options are limited but the goat cheese and apple salad was so good - I'd come back just for that! The place wasn't too busy on a Friday around 8pm, but i imagine their busy-ness is dependent mostly on what sports games are on. There's also a small cozy nook that seats like 8-10 that would be a cute spot to have a private event if they allowed it..We love coming here ! Check out my YT Channel or Instagram for more! 'LOCUS FARENTE' :).Not bad for a neighborhood pub, with really friendly staff!I'm hesitant to write a less-than-stellar review during COVID, because restaurants and pubs are struggling as it is.  Luckily I can keep it at 3 stars, which is not bad.I called on short notice on a Monday afternoon and asked for a table for 4, was set up no problem.  The highlight of the whole experience was our server, a really enthusiastic and friendly guy who made sure we were well taken care of and who was super speedy while fueling us with some food and drinks.Admittedly there's a few food items and drinks they don't have on the menu right now, because of the difficulties of outdoor dining.  And the pub fare they have is kinda average.  With that said, the appetizers weren't bad, and the Sinner Burger I had was OK.  Got about 2-3 beers each, plus apps and a main dish, and paid around $30 each.  Pretty good bang for your buck in NYC.I'm keeping my fingers crossed and staying excited for them opening up indoor dining next month!.The friendliest and best staff in the neighborhood.... the atmosphere is really chill with great seats... and the toilets are ample and adequate....Really nice, genuine Irish pub. Great layout inside, with a round bar in the middle, dining in the back and side rooms (one of which was hosting a birthday when we arrived). Tried the sliders and the fish & chips, both of which were very good. The bartender is actually Irish which is always pleasant to listen to. Have to say, when a place gets bad reviews from people who wanted to turn up at 3:30am, one has to wonder if it was a problem with the staff or with the blotto customer. Having been here, I think the issue is not with the establishment.A real gem!.The last of the Irish bars in the area. Classic irish pub, mediocre food, a bartender who can probably beat you up and could care less about her attitude/ tips. Theres a lot more nicer upscale places in the area, this place isnt for young people, its for the people who grew up in the area 30 years ago. So if you want mediocre pints/food and some lass with a brouge while a oldies rock cover band plays, this is the place for you..Number of visits: Once.It was a few days before the new year, an evening when the temperatures were deathly cold. I came in with two of my friends, looking for shelter and a drink.""Thank you for giving us warmth.""The place, as I remembered, was dark, but seemed cozy. A bar at the center of the room with bar stools lined all around it. A blonde woman was serving drinks. A television or two up on the walls had the game on. Dining tables and bathrooms in the back. A small, adjacent room with couches and some folks looking as if they had just got out from work conversing... or gossiping. In this small room was where we spent most of our time.Drinks could be paid cash or card. You have the choice to open a tab. It was hard getting the attention of the lady at the bar. She would be conversing nonstop with seemingly more interesting characters; her back turned to us. ""Hey! Look at me!""""Give me a gin and tonic.""""Give me a Blue Moon.""""Give me another Blue Moon.""""Give me, give me more, give me... give me, give me more."" (Which quotes did I really say?)One of my friends spilled something. ""How could you?! Lick that $10 off the floor!"" One of the gentlemen cleaned it up, no problem.After about an hour talking and drinking, we left. It was an average experience.Three out of five stars. Will I return? If I was ever cold again... ""Please..."".Left a pair of eyeglasses in a brown case on the bar this early evening.  I have been calling nonstop for three hours already and no one picks up the phone.I used to love this place, it used to be my neighborhood spot. I was in the hood and decided to stop by. The bartenders where switching shifts and were super distracted and disorganized. When we finally got service and ordered food... What a disappointment! I never thought the food here was something to write about, but it was typical bar food, so when we got this disgusting dishes, I was appalled. The onion rings where oily and gross. The calamari was old and the marinara was spoiled and sour.I decided that this was a place for drinking beer and not much else, so a friend and I decided to meet there. I didn't even get trough the door. There were some weird guys supposedly bouncers and did not let me in. I admit that refused to show my ID, but these guys were unprofessional and rude that I honestly thought they were just some dunk guys messing with me. I want to say that I'll return, but I don't see myself ever being that nostalgic about Saints and Sinners."
"Juliano's Espresso Bar has been around for years. I used to live off Lexington on 87th Street and I would come here for coffee when you were allowed to sit inside! Now it's take out and delivery only. It was good to see Juliano. The coffee is still very good and a small coffee is a dollar. I had decaf today since I'm already buzzing with energy. There's only one customer allowed inside at a time. I asked a customer that is a regular and she told me the drill. I could tell most of the customers are regulars. I stood outside drinking my coffee and watched them going in. Only one lost his patience and left! I saw an Apple Bran Muffin for sale. The muffins are $4. I'm thinking of going back for a muffin one day when I'm on my way home. I don't want to carry it around all day and this isn't a place to eat. Other than being disappointed there's no seating, I recommend! Especially for the coffee!!.If your looking for a real decent cup of coffee paired with baked good than if your close by this is the stop you should make.      The owner and daughter are a very cute pair who are up and ready to get what you need to start your day. It's located on the corner with very limited  outdoor seat, but plenty of room inside. If I'm in the area this is my go to spot within two mile radius. I usually have the chocolate croissant which I preferred heated up but today had the blueberry muffin. Better than ordinary muffin but nothing to spectacular stood out. It just hit the spot for this work week..Try the cappuccino! Perfect amount of steamed milk. Also got Juliana to add vanilla flavoring topped with cocoa powder and cinnamon. We also rocked out to Backstreet Boys! If I lived in NY, I would be a regular here..Coffee is watered down. Pastries look stale/old. Coffee was cheap though. Better off spending more money somewhere else..I really don't know why this place is so poorly reviewed on Yelp. Our first visit today and we were pleasantly surprised. Friendly service $4 for a decent large-sized cappuccino and they take credit cards. Great location on 91st & Lex - grab a coffee and walk along one the UES most picturesque streets to Central Park. We will certainly be back.I come here regularly and they serve okay coffee at slightly better prices than other nearby places. I like to support local businesses and not chains and it is conveniently located. The staff isnt particularly friendly, but it is fine. Today I remembered to bring a resuable cup from home and went to Juliano's. The owner refused, quite aggressively and rudely as if I had insulted him. I asked why (no coffee place has ever reacted this way before), and he snarled that my cup might be dirty and he doesn't want it touching his equipment. It was one of the most unpleasant interactions I have had with a business; there are many ways to say no to a customer that doesn't jeopardize them completing a transaction or in my case, a reoccurring transaction. There are many good coffee places in the neighborhood, and I will be giving my (and my family's business elsewhere). By contrast, I walked 2 blocks and went to a competitor after this interaction (I declined buying a coffee after his rudeness). They a) offered to wash my cup for me in and b) gave me a 50cent discount..I asked if the owner could fill my coffee in a reusable cup and he got combative and refused, citing hygiene about not allowing my reusable cup to touch and infect his coffee drip canisters. I stop by this place once a year if I am in need of coffee and the vibe for people of color here is always unwelcoming and tense. I think the guy also hates climate action activists. No thank you. No apologies. He was priming for an argument too based on his body language. Never again..I came here when I was taking a class at 92Y. I got a Latte and a chicken wrap. Coffee and the wrap were just okay. There are no soy and almond milk substitutes. The wrap came with a handful of Mexican-style chips. Don't see any special reason to go back..No frills place with the kindest owner and staff! A true UES gem that caters to locals. My absolute favorite local coffee shop with great coffee and pastries (personal favorite is the cappuccino muffin).$1 coffee. No frills place. Bring cash. I've never gotten anything beyond a coffee so I can't speak for espresso drinks, but the house coffee is always solid and if you ask for milk in your coffee the owner steams it. The owner and his assistant have always been kind and welcoming in the ~10 times I've gone there. Admittedly I was expecting this place to be a horror show after all these negative reviews I've read, but this place is my new go-to."
"I've been to The Bonnie multiple times for brunch and it's always incredible. The service is amazing, the drinks are delicious and the food is always consistently great. This visit I tried their fried pickles, cauliflower leek soup, mac and cheese and the Bonnie burger. I'd order all of these menu items again, especially the Bonnie burger. You can taste the quality of the meat. For drinks, my favorite cocktail is the dirty pickle martini which they kindly substituted with gin pet my request. So delicious!I especially love that you are never rushed once seated.I'd recommend this spot to anyone visiting Astoria..So it's looking like 'we outside again.' Outside & Saturday to me are synonymous with brunch & that how The Bonnie got thrown into my day ! I've been wanting to try this spot for a while now after hearing very good things. Our reservation was for 11:00 AM. We arrived super early and there was no problem adjusting and seating us immediately. The hostess was friendly and accommodating which is always appreciated. If sitting indoors they do check vaccination card and ask for your id. However there is outdoor seating!Now to the food . For starters we had the French toast sticks with pumpkin latte and we asked for syrup. Now to be honest they weren't bad. Fluffy , good bite. When paired with the pumpkin latte foam , good. When paired with just the syrup, better. But when put together , the pumpkin latte mousse and syrup , AMAZING ! I think that how they should serve it , lol. Who am I though ?  We also had the loaded tots for a starter. Thoroughly enjoyed this. It is a good portion so if you're having it maybe you'd want to share.For the mains , my table mate ordered eggs, grits and bacon. She wasn't a fan of the cheese used in the grits but said the bacon was amazing !! I absolutely loved the grits that I got & wasn't a huge fan of the bacon. Go figure lol ! I also order the avocado toast and it wasn't really hitting for me. There was no problem for our waiter to take this portion away. Overall, I would revisit The Bonnie. The service, vibe and ambiance and the food is worth going back. Out of 10 my score would be a strong 7. Give it a try !.Great place to brunch! Make sure to make a reservation or get there early as the wait can sometimes exceed an hour+ during peek times. The kale apple salad...I dream about. So yummy and each topping was mixed in to perfection. The fall sangria was also delicious..While there were not many this year, my trip to The Bonnie was my last outing for 2021.Arrived early to meet a close friend I haven't seen in years. We can blame it on life and of course the pandemic.I was allowed to be seated while I waited, 12/23 & the chill was out, so I started with Hot Mulled Apple Cider. Asked if I wanted Rum or Whisky... I went with Whisky. The warmth worked wonders and I decided to keep them coming. We where here to mostly catch up so we didn't focus too much on the food. However, the fried pickles were a great start and the cauliflower & leek soup was surprisingly tasted and also provided the winter warm-up needed from the draft of the opening door. Lastly the fried chicken sandwich was the perfect finish to help absorb the whisky consumed. Looking forward to returning.Just A Note:HH is available... it's best to Ask a a member of the wait staff to explain what drinks have specials applied..I had come last week with a bunch of girls for their brunch, and I am such a sucker for bottomless brunches loll! The food was amazing and their endless red sangria was spiced just right. None of us could stop drinking it! My one concession, is the space. It was very tight, especially for 8 girls. I have gone a year ago with my husband and another couple at night for drinks. We were seated in their beautiful backyard patio with heated lamps.  It was just right and they even had great mocktails!.Nice homey bar scene with wood paneling throughout. Decent amount of seating inside and definitely not too crammed, they do have an outdoor patio as well. This is definitely the kinda place you go for a cocktail or 2 as they have a menu of about 15 different creative cocktail options for $14 each. The Bonnie punch was excellent and they definitely didn't skimp on the liquor. The beer list is pretty limited, not much out of the ordinary, they do have a beer made specifically for the bar but I found it quite watery. The wine list is pretty decent however and prices are pretty standard. The food menu seemed to be pretty limited but it definitely seems to be more of a go for a drink kinda place then a dinner kinda place. Overall great vibe, great place..My date and I went here this evening and it's safe to say I will be  coming here again .As soon as we walk into the restaurant we were greeted by a hostess and we're seated right away. On the outside you wouldn't notice how huge it  is until you step inside, the atmosphere was pretty diverse and the vibe was extremely welcoming . Now to the food my date and I decided to try the loaded tots , we were pretty surprised to see how they remixed the tots and added their own spin to it , it was delicious. We also ordered the hot honey fried biscuit  which was absolutely one of the tastiest things I've had in a long time ,the flavors ,the crisp, all together made it one pretty good meal . If your in the Astoria area make sure you try this place out you won't be disappointed ..The Bonnie is a VIBE. I came to have a few drinks. Sadly I didn't try the food but I hear it's great. Really cool atmosphere, service is great. Drinks were on the pricier side but they're good.This place gets packed. Whether it's for brunch or a random Wednesday evening, it's really lively. Will come back and try some dishes!.We came in for a quick drink before heading over to Stamatos this past weekend, but I look forward to coming back for much more than drinks and apps. My partner and I kept it simple with a Bonnie lager and a glass of red wine. Our friend joined us and had a sangria and we ordered the queso dip for the table. Everything was good with the queso being exceptional. Even our friend who was not hungry couldn't help but grab a chip here and there. The vibe of this place is awesome. Two bars and an amazing enclosed outdoor space in addition to the restaurant seating make this place perfect for hosting a group event. It really fits any occasion..The best thing about this restaurant is probably the ambiance. Very chic, modern bar area & I can see why it's so popular. We had a reservation for Saturday brunch which we were seated on time (they let us sit without the whole party being present which is a plus!) & service was good. The French toast sticks were probably the best part of the meal & the tater tots were good. Everything after that was very mediocre. The chicken biscuit was dry & the bacon egg and cheese was bland."
"I pass this place everyday with my boyfriend--and we never gave it a try bc he hates everything vegetarian. But we tried it today and he thought it wasn't too bad and was satisfied. I liked it. I regret not trying it earlier. I'm glad there's vegetarian/vegan options for Asian cuisine in this neighborhood. This restaurant is definitely on to something..Really liked simple veggie, but returned yesterday to find it under new ownership, completely different menu, and with a new name ""green zenphony""....Service was friendly, food was tasty, it's still all vegetarian and certified kosher..I was pleasantly surprised to find a vegetarian Chinese restaurant in my neck of the woods, as restaurants like these are hard to come by in Rego Park. I've always had great service at this restaurant. It's usually not packed whenever I come by so I get the benefit of dining in a quiet atmosphere and enjoy my meal.The main dishes I've tried thus far are very good, and does not by any means sacrifice taste just because it's vegetarian. I enjoyed the bento box, which includes an assorted sample of veggie appetizers with wonton soup. Their version of the shrimp tempura is something I would take a pass on, it reminded me more of meat rather than shrimp.Overall this is a great option for lunch or dinner, possibly healthy too, just be mindful when dining late nights since they close at 10:00 pm throughout the week..I was excited to try vegan Chinese food in the U.S. after a really good experience recently in Beijing. I was not disappointed!I'm really grateful that my vegan friend came to stay with me for a few days, because it challenged me to cook and find restaurants nearby that catered to her diet! This place is right on Queens Boulevard past the mall, and was a short walk from my apartment. Easy access, check. The menu was expansive and covered a variety of dishes ranging from dim sum to veggie meat to delicious vegetable dishes. Diverse choices, check.We ordered the house special veggie chicken, the Singapore fried noodles, and the Shu Mai. Honestly, I was completely blown away by the ""chicken"" and noodles, but the shu mai left me wanting more. Usually shu mai have sticky rice and some kind of meat. I was expecting some veggie meat in it or some kind of substitute, but it only had sticky rice and some carrots and peas on top. Still tasty, but I probably won't order it again.The chicken was mouthwateringly good. I loved the sticky rice underneath, it was a pleasant surprise! The texture of the chicken was different from what I had in China, but even impressed my carnivore boyfriend. The noodles were AMAZING and the egg substitute was light and fluffy and full of flavor. I can't wait to return and try out other dishes!.Finally a vegan place in the neighborhood! We've needed one for a while.I've eaten the food twice - first in house and next as take out. The steamed veggie dumplings are slamming. Get them. They're much better than what I've usually had in the neighborhoods. These have a nice wrapping that isn't too thick and a bit of ginger in the mix to add a bit of flavor. So good!My friend and I got the Singapore noodles (good curry flavor and nicely spicy) and the salt and pepper ""shrimp"". These shrimp are quartered and deep fried to mimic shrimp. They were a touch dry and could have used a dipping sauce so we used the sauce from the dumplings, which worked out well.For takeout, I had the Buddhas Delight and had them add in tofu. The dish had loads of veggies and was .... delightful.The service was a little slow. When I arrived, I was the first guest but then another 7-8 tables came in and there was just one waiter - I'm sure that will resolve soon! Technically, this review should be 4.5 stars because they have a few little items to work out but that's expected with a new business. The owner is super nice and definitely working hard to make the business a success.Oh and the decor is great - very zen and the TV showed a rotating set of pictures of their food. Lovely addition to the neighborhood..This place was excellent. Fresh beautifully prepared dishes. Whether you are an omnivore or strict vegan you'll love this place. Bold flavors and great service.Although they just opened this place is a gem. Quality ingredients beautifully presented..Sadly, the present most gracious owner is selling this business. She's assured us that the restaurant will remain veggie, but as we all know: anything is possible..Sadly, the present most gracious owner is selling this business. She's assured us that the restaurant will remain veggie, but as we all know: anything is possible..My friends and I tried this place for the first time. We tried the ""lamb"" curry, ""beef"" noodle, roti, wonton soup and mapo tofu. It was delicious. Non greasy Taiwanese/Chinese food. We were more than happy to eat more but were so stuffed. We will be back. We also got to meet the chef. The workers were kind and shared with us their story about their restaurant. We also tried the strawberry cake. All vegan!!!!!!  Make sure to come and try it and keep these folks in business..recently moving to Forest Hills I was looking for a Vegetarian Restaurant. I found this place using Yelp and I am very happy I did. I have ordered Delivery twice now and both times the food has been outstanding! I am excited that this restaurant is close to my apartment and I am looking forward to dining in. I recommend to all!.I've came to this restaurant a couple times, coming from a family of vegetarians. With that being said, I've been to a handful of vegetarian restaurants and hands down Simple Veggie Cuisine is easily on the top of the list. The price is totally worth the amount of food served. My 40 dollar check left me with leftovers for the next two days! Aside from the prices, the way the foods prepared is also another factor. Most vegetarian restaurants serve the same menu, more often than not. What makes this place so great is the amount of oil they use. What I've experienced in other restaunts is the excessive amount of oil used in the dishes which leaves you feeling slimy and disgusting after your meal... I digress. Simple Veggie Cuisine uses less oil and the food is put together nicely. Also, they have great vegan fried ice cream. If you get the chance, try it out!"
"great coffee some of the best vibes on the planet, galaxy even. changed my life. that's all i wanted to say but i had to reach a character limit..Terrific little coffee book with very friendly service.It's tiny so it's basically grab and go. They had a few seats set up on the sidewalk, and it was easy to chat with the locals here about stuff while I relaxed.After a 6 mile run along the west side highway in the hot sun getting a tasty iced coffee here hit the spot!.The vibe here is great and the staff is so friendly! As a man who loves his coffee, I wasn't disappointed by the roast either!.We were walking to the club and just decided to stop in for a coffee for a caffeine boost. I was awed. The prices were the lowest I have seen in the entire city. The quality of my hot mocha with an extra shot was AMAZING! I will definitely go here for coffee again. It is better than any other place I have been at..Excellent coffee at Oslo.  Some of the best in the city.Every single drink I've had here has been top notch.  The barsitas are always great too.  They work fast and are generally very friendly.The vibe here is chill and comfortable.  I grabbed a bag of beans last time I was here and they were really fresh.  Ground at home, they were great. You get a free drink with beans, BTW.  Thanks..I will be honest, I am not a coffee drinker and did not know what a Cortado was till I went to get one for my friend in a neighboring  store:) so what am I doing reviewing  a coffee shop if I don't partake? Well, I just wanted to say this is an excellent little coffee shop with friendly staff and a far better vibe than the corporate Starbucks who seem to overpopulate every city block. I would definitely recommend..The staff never wear masks! They make no effort to adhere to cdc guidelines, which makes customers think it's ok to not wear masks either.The staff also are super laid back and will let you stand there for a long time before asking if you'd like to order something.Oh, the coffee is very good though... so there is that ..Amazing beans, lots of good variety, cute small little spot in the east village. Kind of expensive but that's kind of to be expected for the area..Best coffee shop in New York. Good vibes and coffee is always amazing. I missed coming here during Covid and I'm so happy they're back open..One of the best coffee shops in the West Village. Whether you're ordering a cortado, cappuccino, or drip coffee you'll enjoy the taste of your drink. I only wish Oslo opened up earlier!"

"Great coffee, upbeat baristas, fun music, and cozy lawn chairs out front on the sidewalk for lounging in the sun! What more could you want?Awesome spot in the neighborhood. I'm now at the point where I specifically crave their cold brew..The coffee was fine, maybe even good, but there is good coffee all over the city where you don't get the impression you're a nuisance to the staff. The man working the coffeeshop was short and dismissive, and when I asked where the lids were he disapprovingly pointed over to the corner and muttered something. I also witnessed two other customers finish their drinks and walk over to put them on the bar/counter. He responded to them, ""I don't need that. I don't need those. Trash is over there."" While the customer was clearly making an honest mistake and probably should have thrown it in a trashcan (if they knew/saw), there are much, MUCH more polite ways of letting someone know. I would recommend Sweatshop coffee - it's a block away..Best coffee I ever had. Tusan Takk. Loved every sip. Come to DC. We need you. The Odin coffee blend included coffee from Guatemala- being a Norwegian-Guatemalan, this truly pleased me..Bad burnt coffee should've went to a bodega literally anything else. Change your drip y'all it ain't that hard.There is no WiFi & outlet available and poor cellphone service (T-mobile is our carrier.) inside Oslo Coffee Roasters. It was not a good place for work but friends-gathering. We ordered their Latte and Mocha with latte art. The coffee was decent, smooth and creamy with no artificial flavor. The price is reasonable around Williamsburg area. However, we might not visit again or only for take-out due to internet status..Got the iced coffee and it tasted like a burnt dark roast. Maybe it's meant to taste strong but  it had a bitter after taste to it that lingered. Also, there was no awake feeling after this coffee..This was my last visit to Oslo before I leave Williamsburg. I've had countless cups of coffee from here. It was my fave. This morning Yelp said they were open so I went over since it's an early day for me. At 7:33 the doors were locked. I looked at the person at the cash wrap, they continued to work. I checked online. Said 'open'. I caught her eye again and she shook her head. I yelled through the door 'it says open online'. She went back to work. First time I'm ever seeing this barista and I waited til the end of my vacation to write reviews of my fave spots. 'I'm so sorry but we don't open til 8. I'll fix it or tell the manager.' Not a '8' and back to work. Poor customer service doesn't work ever especially when interaction with humans is already minimal..Top tier coffee, no sugar needed. It is rich, flavorful, and strong, but not bitter. I get a cappuccino, but friends have tried their straight espresso and lattes as well, and enjoyed them just the same. Fyi, the hours on Yelp are wrong. They don't open until 8am..If I could give 0 starts, I would. The coffee USED TO BE GOOD, now, it's just as bitter as the miserable female working the counter on Monday, January 18, 2021 around 11:00 am. If you don't like your job, find another one..The most deeply miserable and smug customer service I've ever had the baffled displeasure of experiencing. Combine that with the contemptuously thrown-together excuse for an outdoor area, no wifi or restroom accessibility. What an overwhelmingly off-putting place - and what overpriced coffee!"
"Our favorite coffee experience in Brooklyn. They used a piston machine which absolutely fascinated me as a coffee connoisseur, so we asked and he was kind enough to explain it. Honestly, it DID make a better cup of coffee than the semi-automatic machines normally used in cafes. The cortado was a little thicker and silkier than normal cortados. I believe due to the different type of machine used. I don't want to explain it here because I do a blog on latteshots.com that better explains my experiences in greater detail. So if you're interested go check it out when you get a chance and see what you can learn for yourself!.Great coffee. Neighborhood staple for in and out goodness. I think the roast a little on the dark side which I enjoy. Great espresso drinks..I wish this place was bigger, with comfy chairs, beautiful plants, and candles. If it was so, I'd never leave, promise. God, I love Oslo. Their coffee hits the spot each time! Hot or cold, black or with milk. I am a better person after having my Oslo fix, for sure. The staff is friendly and chill. Don't hesitate to get your coffee from Oslo, you will not regret it. *Coffee because adulting is hard..It's crazy how a small iced latte is starting to cost as much as a small lunch. It's a bit ridiculous, but seems to be a pattern everywhere you go. The iced latte pictured below cost me $6. When you factor in the size of the cup and the ice, the amount of actual beverage you're getting for the price is crazy. It was a solid iced latte though. They offer a few different milk options. The interior space is small, but cozy. There are only a few tables inside..Went here on a whim and it is now my favorite coffee I've had in NYC. The flavor is just so smooth! I almost wish I had gotten an espresso just so I could really *get* the flavor. I got a latte and my boyfriend got an iced mocha. Both were great. This place is small and doesn't have much in terms of seating, and no bathrooms, but with the amount of people that go through here, it might be for the best!.So I live 2 floors above Oslo Coffee Roasters on 326 Bedford Avenue. I have been living here for 8 years, a year or two before Oslo opened up.They are blasting intense music every morning at 6 am and every evening between 7 and 8pm.It's terrorizing the entire building. Neighbors are literally losing it. I feel bad for the old couple who lives right above them. They are well into their 80s and they do not know about Yelp or about calling 311. If you care at all about the locals from Williamsburg please do not go to Oslo. Black Brick is just a block away and they not only have better coffee, but they are also respectful people.Support the locals and boycott Oslo!Guillermo.Favorite local coffee shop! Their muffins are ACTUALLY home made, with real ingredients you can taste, they change them every day that's how fresh they are.The stuff is really friendly, no wifi so go to enjoy the newspaper or a book..A bit disappointed once I stepped in, as I was expecting something more relaxing or stylish, both of which I failed to find at Oslo. What was worse, the time I got there (around 430-ish on a Sunday afternoon) they already ran out of pastries! Oh also, remember to ask for skim milk if you are a fan of that, they only serve whole/half and half at the counter.Nothing seemed to work for me here so I would not return..Refused service because I had a legit service animal with tags...when did Williamsburgh get taken over by losers?.This is, by my count, the third coffee chain native to New York to take advantage of the Scandinavia-is-hip coffee trend (others are FIKA and Konditori). Did you know that people in the Nordic countries drink, on average, three times as much coffee per day as the rest of the world? Like Konditori, Oslo Coffee has only a small selection of carb goods for food. However, Oslo probably the best cold brew of any of them, and service is quite quick. If you are on your way down Bedfor to the Marcy L stop, think of Oslo."
"I love the measures this cafe is taking for the safety of the staff and customers by limiting the amount of folks allowed in the space at a time. My cappuccino was warm and tasty--the selection of baked goods was limited although that's likely the time of day I decided to go. There was a book cart if free books for the taking as well as books for purchase throughout. It felt like a safe space right away.I had the best dirty chai latte with oat milk in my life here all while browsing their beautiful selection of empowering female literature. These small little cafes are what make living in Brooklyn so fun!.If you're a fan of great coffee, delicious pastries, diverse representation in books, and champion social justice issues then Cafe Con Libros is the right place for you. The cafe has a cute aesthetic and a lot of of outdoor seating. Staff was friendly and wore masks, and required customers to do the same. Everyone respectfully abided by the store's social distancing guidelines allowing up to 3 customers in the store at a time. I ordered an almond croissant and an iced latte with oat milk.  The almond croissant was sweet and savory; it took me two days to finish due to its generous size, which was a plus--literally. The iced oat latte was delicious and was the perfect choice to cool me down..Absolutely loved this bookshop and coffee shop!  A gem!  The coffee was great and I could have looked at every book in the shop!  Definitely check it out, and go back regularly..Very empowering and unique coffee shop. What a nice combination of coffee and books. Very sweet owner and nice vibe..Black,feminist & bookish ! Do I need to say more. A black owned feminist bookstore . Get your black woman magic, bookworm fill all in one location . This place have multitudes of books celebrating women from all backgrounds, nationalities, cultures etc..no woman could feel left out here. I bought a hibiscus tea that was fresh( no sugar added ) but they do have sugar packets if you want too. At this time only three people are allowed inside for about ten minutes . There will be a line outside and I mean  why not, who wouldn't want to be in here ..I leave this review with a very heavy heart. I had been dying to come here for the longest time and finally got the opportunity to do so today. I want to be very clear, this place is charming, they had the book that I wanted & I fell in love immediately. However. When it came time to pay, I took out cash when the person told me how much it was. He quickly told me that they do not accept cash but only cards and Apple Pay. Here's the problem. How can you say that you are an intersectional feminist establishment but then categorically discriminate against people who do not have that mode of payment? This is a Black neighborhood. Where many marginalized & low income people do not have access to the banking system. By you saying you only accept cash, you are saying that not everyone is welcome here. The person behind the till never understood what I was saying, which was even more alarming because truly I would hope that the people who work there are familiar with what intersectional feminism is and how it works. I cannot in good faith support this establishment as it is not inclusive and this cashless system is indeed discriminatory and elitist..I've been meaning to review this local cafe.  They have a great selection of books, and if you're a foodie their coffee is excellent, and their pastries as well.  They get their pastries from another local baker (Bien Cuit - I'll review them separately) so it's a two-fer!  If you're looking for a small bookstore in the neighborhood where you can sit down and relax and browse, this is definitely the spot..I can't say enough AMAZING things about this spot! Coffee, pastry, and all the change making books! They have a freebie box too. They keep you caffeinated, fed, and make the world a better place. What more do you need??.I ordered a few books from Cafe con Libros in hopes of supporting a local business owned by a BIPOC. It took a little while for my orders to arrive (not their fault but the wholesalers I would assume) but they were super communicative and transparent about order and shipping times throughout the entire wait. I'll definitely be ordering from them again and can't wait to visit their location!"
"Quality + portion size make Ten Full our favorite neighborhood staple for Chinese! The food is delicious, has great flavor, and we are always left wanting more. Don't skip the BBQ ribs, of course the crab Rangoon, and my go-to: the shrimp lo mein. You won't be disappointed!.I'm not sure why this place has such mediocre ratings. This is my go to Chinese food spot in the neighborhood. They have really great lunch specials and their portion size isn't bad either. Their price point is pretty good too. The only thing I wouldn't order again is their Szechuan stuff. I tried it and it is weak. Not spicy and very bland. I had to add my own hot sauce to it for the food to have any heat to it. No peppercorns for the spice so im not sure why it's labeled as Szechuan. All in all I will keep ordering takeout from this place..To my fellow people of color, this place seems to cater to white gentrifiers in the neighborhood. I wanted to try it because of the very high rating on Uber Eats. Now I think they're mostly from the alabaster residents in the Sunnyside area. Completely flavorless. No seasoning. Dry freezer chicken that tasted like potato chips (in texture only, not flavor). They seem to be completely allergic to using even sodium in their food. Absolutely no flavor. No savory taste AT ALL. I ordered lo-mein, lemon chicken, boneless spare ribs, and hot and sour. They had as much seasoning as ice chips in the Arctic. I could barely taste the BBQ in the spare ribs. I took a little sip of the sauce at the bottom of my lo-mein bucket out of incredulous curiosity. It tasted like lukewarm water at a retirement home. If it wasn't for the packets of hot sauce, I wouldn't have been able to eat it and otherwise would've wasted my hard-earned money. I hate writing a review like this as someone of API descent who wants to support Chinese restaurants during this pandemic. However, the food was so bad I felt like I have to warn folks from wasting their money. My entire dinner tasted like a colonizer assault on taste buds. To say I am disappointed and dissatisfied is an understatement..Dear Ten Full, your officially fired!  I've used this place for years for deliveries and was my go to place for Chinese food.  After the last delivery from who was more than rude, I'll NEVER use you again. Here is why;I order delivery and Ten Full charges a delivery fee & expects a tip, which I have no problem with. But for that I expect my food to be delivered not go outside in the snow or rain.  I am in a building that is far from the street and because of that I have explicit directions to get right to my office from the street written on the ticket.  During the last delivery, they call from the street acting as if they are lost and demand I go out in the inclement weather for a curbside pickup.  It's DELIVERY, NOT CURBSIDE PICKUP!And what is worse is I show the receipt with the delivery instructions and can tell they never read it or followed the directions. He calls and I tell him to read the receipt that has the specific directions, and he was belligerent and verbally abusive toward me. This is completely unacceptable!I rarely write reviews but I want others to know the completely disrespectful service I was given and because he never read the directions the food ended up being lukewarm upon arrival.  I gave them a 1 star review because there is no way to have zero stars.We've ordered from here twice now and the experience has been fine. We got spare ribs, shrimp rolls, crab rangoons, 3 greens, fried rice, plantains, broccoli in garlic sauce, sweet and sour shrimp. Everything was hot and good. Both times the order was not completely correct, but it wasn't serious. The containers were packed full, overflowing. Good portions. Delivery person was pleasant. Solid experience both times..This honestly has to be my favorite chicken with broccoli. The people are very sweet and friendly. The food is a bang for your buck..This has been my family's go-to Chinese food place for almost twenty years. So many cherished memories growing up - hanging out with friends, family dinners, grabbing a pint of fried rice when I was hungover. I don't live in NY anymore and I always come back here when I visit..I've been a customer of this place for over 25 years. I've had fast food Chinese all over the country but nothing beats Ten Full and they're always consistent. Favorites are chicken wings, chicken with broccoli, general tso, sesame chicken. Fried rice is also the best. Owners are wonderful and staff is always kind..I would be on Cloud 9 if we had Chinese takeout like this, where I live in Georgia.  We were originally going to eat in Flushing -- I heard their restaurants are better than NY's Chinatown -- but after a long day, decided instead to bring food back to our motel. Ten Full was great!... Egg drop wonton soup -- so many wontons and a tasty broth... Roast pork chow fun -- broad noodles with plenty of lean pork, sprouts, greens and other goodies  ... Chicken with vegetables -- lovely white sauce, generous portion of sliced, white meat chicken and veggiesI like that entrees are available in two sizes.  Prices are reasonable, and the people waiting for their orders, appeared to be regulars.  (With all the takeout places in Sunnyside, there's something's to be said for loyal clientele.).Three stars isn't bad. But this place is utterly average. Another small storefront Chinese take out place in Queens. There are a few small tables if you must sit. I never got sick eating here. The fried rice isn't too greasy. The chicken isn't too chewy.It's tough to park so if I'm on the road I'll keep on going.Look, if you're a local go ahead and order. Everything tastes like you would expect. They have all the usual selections. When I lived in Sunnyside I ordered from here many times.I just can't elevate them above three stars when better choices exist like King Wah on Northern or King's Chef in Whitestone."
"One of my favorite go to places for lunch special. The lunch special is only 8 dollars and you get a lot. They give you the option of two different soups, and two different rices with juice. Each day is different so that is a plus because it's nice a fresh made. The soup varies as stated and you can choose what you want. As well the rice with whatever they give you. Sometimes it's rice with fried beef and salad, others rice with fish and salad, and much more. For the price this one of the best lunch special around the area period. Now as to per not eating during lunch hours, well I'm big on the Encebollado, Bolon de queso and Bollo de Pescado. I'm a big fan of the Bolon de Queso with a nice cup of coffee, can't go wrong with that when you want something simple. Other then that, this is a great place to come and eat Ecuadorian food, especially their lunch specials..You definitely don't come here for the service. The service is non existent and they tact on a gratuity. But if you can forget about all of that, then you'll enjoy the food. The food tastes good but it does take a while to get it. Overall i'd go back.I can start by saying the service in this place needs improvement. Wether dining in or ordering out the wait is always ridiculous. I have only ever ordered the sopa marinera which is their seafood soup. It has fish, clams, calamari and shrimp and is always delicious which is kind of a blow when you want to order but don't want to wait 2hrs to eat..Me and my husband love the food here but the service sucks. They have no one that speaks English there which also sucks. Getting your food delivered takes forever . But because the food is amazing that is why we still go there..Come for the delicious Ecuadorian food. The location is simple and the food is amazing. There is a long wait time between ordering your food and getting it but the food is so good and fresh that I don't mind the wait. We ordered margaritas bulldog style which makes the waiting seem shorter than what it is. Nice tropical salsa is playing while you eat and they're not in a rush for you to leave after you finish..Worst place ever.Took over 20 minutes for my food ceviche that comes straight from the fridge. While a male worker stuff his face at the bar. Then my drinks came after my food. Then to top it off was charge $26 for two drinks that was suppose to be $10 according to the advertising happy hour. Waitress try to tell me that we order after 8pm when my receipt clearly states that I order at 7:45. I don't expect owner to see this by looking at all the reviews and no answer to the customers. Very poor service and very unprofessional.Would give 0 stars if I could.In this Pandemic era, great Ecuadorian food has given some soothing to anxieties. Food is delicious, Caldo de salchicha and seco de chivo are the best..My mother found a dead fly in the food we talk to the staff that we won't pay for the food she order but they had the audacity to still put it in the bill i wanted speak to the manager and she was clueless after explaining everything what happen and plus i order a ceviche to go and never gotta it they need to replace manager... I'm a Server and manager to i don't treat people at my restaurant with disrespect.TERRIBLE--- The only reason I come here is because my father loves their food..today I ordered an avocado salad because the restaurant was a disarray. I kept it as simple as possible because I did not want to be aggravated with the staff getting my order wrong. Explain to me how a restaurant can make a salad with SPOILED lettuce it beyond me. I returned the salad with no apology from the staff and they charged my bill still with the 9.50 avocado salad that was spoiled!!! Take my advice and toss your salad before you begin to eat because the spoil lettuce underneath everything . TERRIBLE****MANAGEMENT -- should really reconsider the 18% GRATUITY they charge for parties as little as 3 people-- maybe your staff would be inclined to do their job with integrity and respectfully!!***.The food here is good for an Ecuadorian restaurant. However, the service is atrocious. It took us perhaps 10-15 minutes for them to bring us water. Yes 10-15 minutes. When I tried putting my order for my food I told them to substitute the pork for steak. Which they then refused to do. Then once my food was brought out I waited for my date to get her ceviche. Which they forgot completely until I asked again. My food was then already super cold for waiting for a dish they forgot to input. Nevertheless, the food is decent. Highly priced. To much for the horrible service. I feel if you don't want your order ruined to have them repeat it back to you."
"My friend and I ordered delivery from this place. She's a regular and I am the newbie. She ordered the Sesame Chicken platter with the egg roll. I got the Boneless Chicken with Garlic Sauce and Pork Fried Rice and a small Wonton soup.Great Wall gave me HUGE pieces of boneless chicken and it was very fulfilling. I wish it was a tad spicier. The Pork Fried Rice was standard. I wish I had more soy sauce. The Wonton soup was good. Better than the one I recently had.All in all, if you want standard Americanized Chinese food with fast delivery, Great Wall is for you. It does hit the spot..bad food specially the fried rice that thing have no taste I will not recommend you have a Lotta better Chinese part in the area I just ordered from there because everyone else is closed on Tuesday....This restaurant needs to get some customer service going on with the older kid that is working.  It beggars belief that I work all week and a child is going to be rude and dismissive of me when asked a simply question.  No customer service! No manners!  Wanted to give it -1 star. They need to understand that my money is contributing to their college fees in the future!.YUCK YUCK YUCK! these people need to learn to cook clean! have you seen the bugs in there? yeah they just wiupe it with the same cloth they clean their hands with and also hold the pots with... the rice tasted like it was doused with water! disgusting. the chicken wings are just over cooked and dry tot he bone! they even have chicken feather residue left over on it! yeah not so good! Good luck with this place! they used to have tacois there too no wonder they closed that part down! YUCK!.The little bitch who answers the phone is RUDE. This place has really gone downhill since the original owner passed the business down to her kids. Used to go here all the time but got tired of giving money to these people when the teenage girl is always so nasty and the food quality has declined while the prices increased.I decided to give them another go, because like I said, there was only really a problem that time.  I didn't want that one incident to spot what was at least a pretty good rep..  Just now, I ordered my usual, and they actually took to splattering the barbecue sauce on my fries not the chicken.  This was clearly a kiss my a** act because they always prepare the chicken to itself while dousing it with barbecue sauce, and then they pour it into the carton where the fries lay in wait.  They really wanna show me what I can do with my five star rating, and my gracious tip. Now take this lone STAR CRISP RATING! How about that!.Delicious food.  Fast delivery.  My personal favorite is one they make especially for me.  I guess anyone could get it if they asked.  Anyhoo,  I order their boneless chicken or shall I say chicken cutlet with Honey barbecue sauce all over, this tricks my palate into thinking I'm eating boneless spare ribs (can't have too much pork), I often order this with a side of fries with ketchup all over.  Then I polish it off with a nice cold PEPSI! It's a wonderful thang baby!One point of contention.  Recently,  when making the order of this specialty chicken,  an obvious young smart a** little thang gets cute with me about it. I have always had a point of ordering this way, I don't know why she's playing dumb now. I know mama wanna act grown, and obviously is desperate to believe she's as much woman as the one she's talking to, but she needs to be told to stay in her lane. A truly mature cerebral young lady realizes when they're trying to run a business,  there's no time for quips and games. It's always MONEY BEFORE FUNNY HONEY! I AM THE ONE, YOU NEED TO IMPRESS!  If you didn't know YOU HAD BETTER BELIEVE IT!  A NOTE TO HER PARENTS. ..PLEASE TAKE YOUR DAUGHTER OFF THE PHONE.  DON'T LET HER DESTROY WHAT YOU'VE WORKED HARD FOR!"
"My husband swears their Mexican corn is the best in the city, and he loves the tacos. There's nothing that can be called the best here fir me though. And I've really really tried to like this place, especially since it's so convenient to where we live. But it's just not particularly good.The service is eh on a good day. And this is a place that doesn't have a lot of people and you're ordering at the counter. The ceviche (which is served from the other side where it is table service) was awful. We took one bite and tossed it. It's not the best. Not the worst. It just is..We had the nopalitos salad. Overpriced and lettuce was starting to brown. The avocado and tomatoes that came with were decent. It was just a standard salad with some cactus on top..This place is overpriced. The menu was very deceptive and didn't have price next to the tacos and quesadillas. I was quite hungry and ordered 2 quesadillas and a burrito bowl. The order on the right in my pic was apparently the two quesadillas. Since when did quesadillas become grilled tacos?? It was very disappointing. Considering the number of authentic Mexican places within a 3 block radius, I recommend hitting those up instead..Don't come to La Palapa if you are planning to take advantage of their advertised New York Restaurant Week meal. Even though there were signs on the doors promising the special meal, I was told they were not offering it. When I asked a man behind the counter if it would ever be available he said ""I don't know"" and turned away from me. We came quite a distance to this inconveniently located restaurant and were disappointed to be treated so rudely. We won't be coming back..Great tacos and Mexican corn.  I love the restaurant so I'm so glad they opened this  outlet.  I really don't understand the negative reviews on here."
"For brunch, my bestie and I decided to try this place out. She had been here for dinner twice before and loved it so we decided to try it for brunch. Situated right on the corner of Dekalb, the place is quite cozy. We walked in since we were unable to make reservations. After checking our vax cards we were promptly seated. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, since it was cold out we were inside. The menu was a scannable version, I was unable to pull it up so I was given a printed version. They don't have a very large brunch menu but I quickly opted for the fried chicken and waffles. I also had an aperol spritz. My bestie had the fish sandwich and a Bloody Mary. The drinks came out quickly and we were able to enjoy before the food came out which was also very quick! My fried chicken was cooked to perfection with one piece of dark meat and one piece of white meat. It came with some lovely hot sauce. The wake was very light and fluffy with a delightful syrup. My aperol spritz was light and bubbly, quite refreshing for brunch. My bestie had the sandwich which she enjoyed, she had a lot of fish stuffed in that English muffin, and an abundance of French fries. She loved her Bloody Mary as well.The service was excellent, the restaurant was clean, the prices were good, and the ambiance was great. I definitely will be back for dinner!.Likes- nice neighborhood. Opposite Fort Greene Park- good service Dislikes- bar steak overcooked, pretty tough- burnt steak.So the three stars are for the service & drinks. Every staff member - hostess, manager, bartenders, & even kitchen staff that I ran into by the bathroom - were so friendly and kind and helpful. Excellent service. Busy Saturday night and they were all on point. Drinks were strong. My  old fashion and hot toddy (so what, Im old!) were tasty and packed a punch. But the food... not good. Maybe an off night? My Tuscan soup was cold and the beans were hard. Wings were salty and my friends mash was cold. Her friend chicken was bland.I'd still try this place again. Vibe was good, atmosphere was cool, staff was kind and accommodating. I'd give it another go and order something different..Please be patient! The restaurant was packed and staff was limited. We waited for about thirty minutes before our server was able to greet us. We put our drink and food order in at the same time. The bartender was cranking out drinks as fast as he could! The Walter's Burger was cooked to medium well perfection. A sign of a good burger is when no ketchup or other condiments are required. This burger was that! The Saigon Sandwich was equally as delightful. Fresh baked bread, crunchy slaw with that refreshing taste of cilantro....yum. I'm not one for margarita's, but the bitter margarita was SO good. I could drink those all day long..Stopped off for lunch at this location, and it was the perfect day to do so. We grabbed a little table outside and it was awesome for people watching.We started with a shrimp cocktail and it was delicious! So fresh and tasty, with lemon and cocktail sauce.For my main course I had an amazing rigatoni dish, it was spicy with some fresh veggies and a light sauce, I gobbled down the whole plate it was so good! For drinks we had some tasty old fashions they were awesome, and perfect for the fall day. All around great experience, awesome service and ambiance, I can't wait to go back and check out some fresh oysters and other cocktails..Update 2022 My friends and I are regulars here because the food is really good! Come here on a good night when it's not too crowded (weekdays/ nights). Weekdays are great or summertime on the weekends. Just keep a look out, it's a popular joint! The burgers are great with the fries. The fries are skinny with a crisp/ crunch with every bite. Kale Cesar, octopus also delicious. Normally get the martinis there with olives.Only con is the bartender. I don't know why but every time we are there it DOES NOT seem like he wants to serve us. Slow or busy night. We don't ask for special treatment or customize anything. We like to think we are friendly, order our food and drinks and keep to ourselves. Seems like he could care less if we were even breathing. That's OKAY we enjoy the food and most importantly the company of each other. Will not order martinis there again if he is serving us. Dangerously WAY TOO SALTY, too dirty. Our martinis were brown --others were not, maybe they requested not dirty .. OR maybe some other reason. Anyhow we ate dinner quickly didn't order another round, didn't finish our drinks and left. It was the shortest time we had ever sat down and had a meal there. Wasn't a pleasant feeling to be around. --We certainly will be back but will be selective to what we order drink wise pending on bartender and NOT sit at the bar again. Still would recommend this place for obvious reasons that the food is great, drinks can be good and staff 99.9% of the time are the coolest!.4/5 --Love the lunch vibes!Sat at the bar 2 of us, cousin visiting from out of town. It's always a fun vibe here. The restaurant is generally always busy. We had a bottle of rose and 2 extra glasses, side order of fries , shrimp cocktail and dried rub chicken wings. The chicken wings were my favorite! Man is it tough to find good wings in the city. I still stand by Rochester and Buffalo having the best wings. The skid was crispy while the meat was moist and cooked all the way through. Loved their seasoning. Delicious! Can't wait to have that again! Everything else was good too but can't really mess up shrimp cocktail. I guess you can fail on fries but their fries are delicious! It was a nice afternoon to have a bottle, few drinks and snack. We'll have to go back for a full on meal!.Delicious local brunch spot! Wait was not bad, as we arrived at the restaurant pretty early. The place has great vibes, great service, and just a good time! We ordered the eggs Benedict with ham and chicken & waffles. Everything was tasty and no complaints. We'd like to return for dinner so we can try the dip sandwich. We also ordered a side of fries, which by the way, was probably the best we ordered. The fries were salty, but SO SO crispy. Would def. come back! Take a walk to the farmer's market afterwards!.Does anyone else go out to grab drinks with friends and inevitably always order fries and artichoke dip? If so, this is so your spot. The vibe I get from Walter's is elevated neighborhood bar and perfect for grabbing quick but reliably great food and drinks. The drinks are incredibly well balanced and refreshing, especially the smoked palomino and bitter margarita. The fries are thin, crispy, and will be gone before you know it. Pro tip: ask for a side of the scallion aioli to dip em in and you won't be disappointed. The artichoke dip is also delicious and soul warming. I'd also recommend putting your name down even if it looks like a long wait. Both times I've gone I've gotten a table much faster than anticipated..Excellent second choice brunch spot!I stumbled in Walter's sort of by accident. My best friend and I were attempting to eat at Imani, a few blocks from Walter's but they hadn't opened yet. As it was a chilly outside and we were very hungry, she suggested we go to Walter's. It was my first time dining here but she has been in the past. While I had my heart set on the Jerk Chicken Hash from Imani, the Chicken & Waffles from Walter's did not disappoint. The portion size and flavor were great. The side of eggs were also cooked perfectly!Additionally, we had some oysters which were fresh and yummy. For our beverage, we both went with the bitter margarita which was also good. It's annoying when things don't so as planned but it's great when the second choice delivers everything you need. I'll definitely be adding Walter's to my list of brunch spots..Cute small neighborhood spot the menu is limited but good choices. Tables inside are very close together this is a good spot for a solo adventure or a intimate group. Busy for brunch and at times drinks. The staff is friendly and attentive. The comply with mask / vaccine mandates."
"Ventured out in Chinatown and had a very good Chinese lunch.  We tried 2 different meals and split them.  Non English speaking servers which is fine.  Menu was also in English.  Warm food on a snowy day In Manhatten..My family and I visited this establishment on the off chance as the streets around Mott Street were blocked with crowded spectators viewing the lunar new year parade. Located on Mulberry Street, HK Wonton Garden is a quaint old school Chinatown restaurant serving Cantonese cuisine where every table was full. While we only had to wait a few minutes couldn't help notice the staff was wearing Hawaiian shirts and dollar bills from all over the world taped to walls. Known for their wonton soup, I ordered as an appetizer. The wontons stuffed with shrimp and pork weren't huge but enough around 8 and the broth was so flavorful. As an entree, we shared the Pan Fried Noodles With Seafood (Shrimp, squid, fish cake and scallop). The noodles were so crispy. The food came out quickly, tasty and the right portion for the price. We can recommend this place as it's one of the few restaurants to accept credit cards..Great spot to pick up Cantonese food.  Price is just right if you need to pick up dinner for you or your family.  There is parking after 7 and paid parking on Saturday in front if you can find a spot for a quick in and out.  Their egg noodle is to die for and probably not offered in your local Asian establishment.  All you have to do is point at the menu..Everything is amazing here...maybe best Chinese in NYC? I'm serious...what more can I say?.I had two wonton noodle soups ... the roast pork wonton noodle soup and the beef stew wonton noodle soup.. both were very good although I liked the beef one a bit more ...looking forward to trying their beef chow fun.I almost always goes to this restaurant every time I wanted a hearty beef stew wonton noodles soup during the cold snap of winter. The broth of the soup is well made from beef being braised for many hours.  The big wontons are filling with juicy pork bits and shrimp.  The noodles I chosen were the thick wheat Shanghai noodles.  The sinewy beef rough flank was tender while the rough gives you something to chew on for that mouth feel. This entire bowl fill me up quickly and provided me enough energy for the whole day.  The condiment of choice is the chili oil flavor crisps known as LoMa Jiang gives it an added heat without messing the soup up..One of my favorite places to have wonton noodle soups!  Of course I can make my own wontons and my own wonton noodles but I think during this time it is so important to rally around Chinatown and show our love and support to the Chinese community!  H K Wonton Garden is a classic restaurant.  This restaurant has been here for years. I am also a big congee fan. I can have it anytime during the day. The best congees would be congee with preserved egg & sliced pork and minced beed, squid and fish fillet. If you want to be kind of boring, you can always order rice with ma po tofu (basically rice with spicy tofu and pork) or beef and broccoli. Lol. The menu is really big. I would be shocked if you can't find something to eat. Also, ask for some jasmine hot tea. Tea with Chinese food is always a good combination!  Enjoy!.I had the chicken lunch special with cake with a nice sauce and an appropriate amount of rice. Price at $7 was a steal. The wonton soup is delicious. I got the shrimp (around 8 dumplings) and also ordered noodles (thin) at no extra cost for a flat $6. Another steal since it comes in a quart container.The service was much better than at Great NY Noodle (they took the ""regulars"" before me and barely acknowledged me). The owner listens to your order and doesn't rush you which means they appreciate your business..As NYC Chinatown is slowly dying amidst the insanity of this pandemic, this old school Cantonese noodle shop is hanging on. Food is just as good as I always remember it being. The wait staff has been there forever. Without revealing my age, I'll just say, it's been a few decades of great food. Their roast pork (char Siu) is so good! Prices are great too if you're not looking to break the bank. So GO OUT AND GET SOME AWESOME FOOD!!.Got $32 worth of food... flat noodles with beef, salt and pepper with squid and wonton noodle soup.Essentially everything was underwhelming. Noodles in wonton noodle soup wasnt the fresh ""jumpy"" kind that other ct restaurants have. Wontons was mix of pork and shrimp which is fine. The stir fry noodles felt a bit oily and soy sauce wasn't crazy present. There was that soy auce color though. The salt and pepper squid is nothing like that I normally see it in the white fry look (See pic). Since the squid was like $14, I think the other two items were 8 to 9 each if i estimated. I wouldn't come back. No dinning tables during covid."
"I just went here tonight for the first with my girlfriend and another friend.At first, I was kind of held back by the look of the restaurant -- empty. But since the menu was cheap, so I decided to give it a try...heck, I only live once, might as well.I got myself ""Beef Fried Rice"" which cost $5.95. I was like, ""it probably won't be much"". BUT I was wrong! The portion was HUGE!!! The dish had eggs, peas, and beefs. The rice was nicely seasoned and fried. I was full after that.Overall, a really good and friendly service...I will definitely come back here for more!!!!.This is my first review. I am not a tourist. I don't cross a bridge in my car.I don't take a train to Grand Central Station. I live here. From 3rd to Amsterdam, SPA-HA to Chinatown I navigate these city streets on two Italian wheels. This is my domain. I am a foody, urban adventurer, and world traveler. This is my life and life is good. Let us begin.Chanoodle is situated in between the bodegas and fish markets of Chinatown. The way I have learned to select restaurants in the many different neighborhoods of this city is to simply eat where the people eat. It is not out of the ordinary to walk into this fine establishment and find New York's finest eating and conversing in Chinese. Neighborhood cops enjoying great Chinese food. You will also see neighborhood families sharing large quantities of food around one of the large round table. You will also find tourists fresh off their quests for a fake Rolex (folex) or the latest Gucci (fucci) nock off. You will also find me. So what's hot you ask?The hot and sour soup is exactly that, hot and sour which is the way I like it. No over peppered soup here. It's Delish!I always order fried rice. Chicken, Beef, Shrimp, or Plain you ask? You can't go wrong, it's all good and enough for the whole table.Niki, my partner in crime loves the orange beef. It is sweet, crispy, and oh so spectacular. Try it you will not be sorry.Now what I really enjoy is the Peking style pork chop. It is tangy, tender, and enough for the whole table to enjoy. I highly recommend it.Wash it all down with one of their many bubble teas and that's a wrap.I guarantee you will be pleasantly surprised how little it costs to get a great meal in Chinatown especially if your used to dialing for delivery..Rainy day. I was in Chinatown and mood for somehing new. I spotted  this hidden place on Mulberry near Bayard St.Lunch for only $4.75 with soup & fried rice (or white). Chinatown is cheap but I did not know that cheap. I peeked in side. It's updated with Chinatown modern. I saw few customers sitting and I was pushing myself in. It was only 11:30am. I sat the corner table near the window. I ordered Squid with ginger and scallion sauce. I like squid but I've never cooked at home somehow.Soup:Hot & sour soup - It was light as I like with mild heat. It was my first experience having tomato in the soup but strangely I was happy.Main:Squid with Ginger and Scallion sauce - Squid wasn't overcooked but okay. The half-dead and dry ginger slices were wrinkled and unappetizing. Scallion were cut too long. I like Scallion but I don't eat it that much and that raw and it wasn't a sauce (see the added photos).Rice:Usually I choose white. I like to enjoy the sweetness, purity and clean texture of white rice with some strong flavor and taste main dish. I want main dish to shine.I like my fried rice to be not weighted down, light and fluffy and hopefully has smokiness like the one from Saigon Grill. Extra white pepper always adds good childhood memories. Good looking fried rice was in a small bowl ((see the photo). The pepper on the table was definitely not fresh. It lost its flavor and had a strange smell and after taste. I bring my own next time.I liked their fried rice and hot & sour soup. For main, I choose something different next time..3.5Know what you are looking for. I'm looking for a fast eat at a low price for me and granny.We had seafood chow mein. It was delicious as I expected with crispy noodles that were drenched to softness in the center by sauce and seafood (some squid, some shrimp and fake crab cuts) and veggies (teeny corns, carrot slices and broccoli).This counts as a restaurant that is HandiFriendly because the bathroom is on the same level as the dining room and the door actually has a ramp that leads up to the restaurant. Kudos for handifriendly!.If you are ever in New York City in Chinatown please try this small quiet restaurant. I found this several years ago when doing business twice a month. Came across it while looking for bubble gum tea.I notice that allot of people where in the restaurant in a relax , friendly atmosphere without the loudness or rush.There prices start from $2.00 to $14.95 plus add NYC tax.You cannot beat that. The shrimp fried rice is not for one person but two and 1/2.it is the real deal, not like the rice you have in Boston.It is made of white rice stir fired in oil, with the shrimp, peas and eggs.Delicious....The ice green tea for $1.00 comes in a large glass no ice just the right amount of sugar,And the service  is great, they do not rush you to leave. And if you have a questions on any of the items served they will take there time to explain.The menu is in English and in Cantonese.Down to earth place off Broadway away from the tourist ...They also serve Chinese Breakfast at 11 am.Have not tried it yet, but will let you know when I do.A great small business with allot of god service try it when you are in Chinatown - NYC..I never got a dish here I didn't like.  The fried rice is beyond amazing.  The duck is served with the soft sweet buns.  MMMM-damn!  The soups are very good and the chicken broth is probably the best I've tasted in a soup.  The menu is vast and I actually am trying to get different things each time I go.  The prices are just right.  Check it out..I go to this place almost every other week. My friend and I love sitting there, relaxing, and chatting. Not a very cozy atmosphere, but the service is good (prob. because we go there so often). If you can read Chinese, get the Chinese menu. $20 for three dishes, 1 soup, and 1 dessert (mango pudding). And they have a wide range of dishes, too. Pretty delicious.I recommend getting the XO Sauce Seafood. Looove it. And for those of you who don't give a damn about your cholesterol, the fried calamari is pretty good, too. Don't order the sesame chicken. Hard as a rock..Stopped by here one Saturday afternoon with my lady friends. It's a small little shop. I had the fried rice which was good. Look, the thing about this is it is cheap. It's cheap food and how can you mess up fried rice? Well, some places can, but this didn't. I ordered my standby which is chicken fried rice and they gave me a BIG portion (with egg in it, just how I like it!). If I'm in Chinatown and need a cheap plate of chicken fried rice, I'll definitely stop by here..Found this place during the taste of Chinatown. The duck is great, served on those soft pancakes, not a flour tortilla. Clean, with a friendly staff. The menu is extensive; pick something new every time and your won't be disappointed. (really, promise yourself you wont just get duck this time, and at least try to stick to it) Even the tea tastes just a little better than a lot of other places. It take a lot of willpower to go somewhere else, and harder to resist that duck..I had a pineapple fried rice here once and I LOVED it! I literally ate down to the pineapple and scratched it down also. It was really delicious. The food here is really well-made neatly freshly."
"Just found out that this business has closed which is quite unfortunate since I haven't had the chance to visit again. The one time that I visited, I ordered the fried squid legs and fries, both of which were freshly made and very tasty. The squid was seasoned nicely and was meaty. Many other places would over-fry the squid and season with too much salt, but OFC made them perfectly. The fries were also really good! They use shoestring fries which reminds me of McDonald's but not as salted.Sad to see another business close down, most likely due to the underwhelming amount of patrons since the pandemic. I would have highly recommended OFC for the fried squid legs..They are currently offering takeout so I decided to give it a try after hearing good things. I got a menu and opted for combo 1 and combo 4. Later I saw there's actually combos with just chicken which was what I wanted that isn't on the menu. The food here is nothing special -- I think popeyes has better fried chicken and the popcorn chicken is sort of like prince tea house's. If I had to pick between the 2 combos I got I think combo 4 was definitely better. I wouldn't come back again because it was pretty expensive compared to popeyes and not as good. The passion fruit with kumquat was pretty decent though!Service is good and the employee speaks English which is a plus!.Of all the Asian-run businesses in the neighborhood, my heart breaks apart that this is the restaurant that closes. Looking back in my memories, I can still taste the deep fried squid legs, ladened with oil and five spice, dipped in a thick sweet and sour Thai sauce. It's a craving, I will now have to travel outside of the neighborhood for.If you're reading this OFC Chicken V, you have happy customers waiting your return. Me and literally every person who walks out of the gym across the street..My office ordered this for delivery one Sunday afternoon. I decided to get a combo 7 (Taiwanese beef noodle soup, popcorn chicken, OFC fries). The beef noodle soup was super delicious - it came with a great variety of items including meat and vegetables. The broth was slightly on the sweeter side which I like but if you're not as interested in that flavor profile you may want to skip it instead. The popcorn chicken and fries were unfortunately slightly soggy. However, that could have been because they were fried food traveling in a sealed container. The flavoring of the chicken was great and it was nice and juicy. However, the fries were a little bit dry and under seasoned. All in all, a nice lunch provided by the restaurant and a good chicken option in the area..I used to only drop by for bubble tea every now and then, but lately I branched out to their hot foods and I've been so impressed! Their spicy fried chicken sandwich actually packs some spice compared to the Popeyes' chicken sandwich, though the bread isn't as good. The fried chicken was juicy, tender, and very delicious. I also give two thumbs up for the popcorn chicken--it's a bit garlic heavy, if that's your thing. For only $4.50 you get a huge portion, a good snack for two. I've recommended these items to a friend who lives nearby and she and her family can also attest. I've heard good things about the squid and can't wait to try that soon! My tip is to order in advance for pickup because it takes a while to make everything fresh, or plan to walk around and run some errands while your order is prepared..Yesterday, my brother-in-law & his wife wanted some fried chicken for lunch; my sister-in-law suggested here while licking her lips thinking about the chicken. I laughed at her for licking her lips and couldn't wait to try it. This has always been on my list but I never had it (shame on me, I'm Taiwanese and love supporting my fellow Taiwanese businesses). My brother-in-law placed the order (I tried encouraging him to order directly via phone) but he used seamless  since most people do not like the human contact anymore. We ordered: 2 Braised Pork Over Rice 卤肉饭1 Combo #2 Fried Chicken Cutlet combo- Fried Chicken Cutlet & Fried Chicken Leg (DRUMSTICK) +Sweet Potato Fries+1 Drink- Honey Black TeaChicken Cutlet Bento 鸡排便当There was no other option to select other drink (but Ubereats says you can select soda (coke/diet coke) or water bottle. I like to compare all the different food delivery platform to compare prices and offerings (I noticed each platform Combo#s are different- Yelp vs Ubereats vs Seamless). I like to see all the options to make sure nothing is missing before I decide what to order and then I usually call the restaurant directly to place order. Of course, I am expecting the fries to be soggy by the time they are delivered- yes they were. Chicken cutlet were cold and soggy as well but the chicken leg (aka drum stick) was still crispy & room temp. I do live far from the shop so I was expecting that. There was a small cup of sweet tangy sauce on the side which I assume is for the chicken. 2 long skewer sticks are provided in the box; dipped in the sauce & was delicious. The sauce was not mentioned anywhere on the website or menu.Braised Pork Over Rice came with mixed vegetables on the side which was a unexpected surprised. But after eating it, decided that it does goes with the meal since it provided a different texture/taste from the classic chinese leafy vegetable on the side. The Korean pickled radish gave extra crunch. I wish there was more sauce ladled over the meat & rice because you know the rice would already absorb much of whatever sauce with the pork. The pork seem overdone but there was tender soft fatty pork belly in between the lean pieces to make up the dryness of the pork. I noticed mine look different from other pictures of this dish. Meat was smaller portion than other pictures. But it was very fulfilling. Ate every bite.I can't wait to try it next time when I'm in the area so I can eat it freshly hot (perhaps when indoor dining reopens?) and it isn't too cold for outdoor dining. Kind of hard to eat outside if there is no outdoor seating and you don't want to remove your masks eating while standing/walking around strangers. It's times like this, I wish there are more public benches available so that I could at least sit/eat something..Tasty! Always good flavors as expected. Love their sweet potato fries, crispy on the outside and tender in the inside, with some sprinkle of plum powder - authentic Taiwanese flavors! I tried crispy chicken burger this time and was also great, with a large pice of meat (so large they I couldn't finish it!). Love them as always..I was in the area and wanted an afternoon snack and decided to come here for some popcorn chicken! My fiance wanted combo 4 so we ordered 3 to bring home to share! Combo 4 comes with fries, popcorn chicken, fried squid legs and a drink- either green tea or black tea. We got three green teas along with the 3 orders we got.  By the time we got home, maybe 20 minutes later, everything felt a tad soggy to eat. Flavor of the popcorn chicken was great and the squid legs are also good but the fries were just whatever. They provided some sweet chili sauce that was really good and my family all enjoyed it.  The green tea was also VERY nice to have and they give a large cup of it. I think overall the food is great but I think for the price of the combo ($11.25), the portion seems to be just a tad on the smaller side..I've driven by this place a few times with my boyfriend but never had it . We decided to stop by on a saturday for an afternoon snack. My boyfriend goes to the Chinatown location for lunch occasionally so he knew the place fairly well. I think he said the menu is slightly different in Chinatown but generally the same things- combo meals of popcorn chicken/calamari with fries or fried chicken pieces. All combos come with a drink- ice green tea or black tea. I actually love this idea- it feels very homey. We ordered the popcorn chicken with calamari along with the ice green tea. The total was about 10 dollars BUT I think its pretty worth it. They give you a good amount of chicken thats freshly fried and they do not skimp you on the calamari. We were eating this along the drive back home, and we managed to eat until we got  home because there was that much in that box! Fries are just whatever but the calamari was very good!! There was a nice crunch, not overly salty! And as we were eating, we were drinking our teas, like what our moms would make us do if we're home! I will come back to this place when I want a snack! Though I think service can be better- the lady at the cash register took orders and packed the teas but she didnt look too happy. Maybe a bad day?.I'm surprised about all the mediocre reviews, came to pick up some food. Got some fried squid, chicken cutlet, and fried chicken.The fried squid is amazing! It has so much flavor and the crisp is light and crunchy. Just like what I had at Hot Star in Asia.The fried chicken was also juicy and fried well! Better than places like Popeyes.The cutlet was okay though! Not the greatest but not bad..My family and i got chicken from OFC for Christmas after seeing that Popeyes was closed. We ordered popcorn chicken, chicken wings, and giant fried squid to go. The chicken and squid were all very well seasoned. You don't really need sauce with the food for it to taste good. The five spice is very prominent in a good way. The only thing that knocks it down from 5 stars for me is the fact that it all got really soggy very quickly. By the time we got it home (we don't live that far away), the batter was already soft and soggy. Overall I would come back, but only if I'm eating it immediately or on the premise once Covid is over."
"Disclaimer: I am a rabid meat eater. I love meat and will prob die of a heart attack due to it but my tombstone wil read ""died happy"". Anywho, I tried the broccoli tacos as people have told me that even I and my meaty ways would love them, so I got two and that turned to 5! I cannot believe how good they are, so savory and crunchy and I love the soft taco hard taco layering. They are soooo addictive. Crave worthy is putting it mildly. Also of note is their fried fish taco which has some strawberry pieces on it in addition to the other toppings they put on. Who'd think strawberry would be so effective? Pretty big piece of fish and large taco overall. I can't speak to the other items on the menu as Im just so addicted to the tacos that that's what I get every time I go lol. Total comfort food those tacos are!.Had a brief stop here while waiting for a friend to finish an audition. Bartender was great... Had the hot cider, and a homemade ginger soda with a shot of whiskey! My guest had a drink, but don't remember what it was. Lol They were closing up soon for a private event so i couldn't grab a bite to eat. I will have to revisit, but the brunch menu didn't seem too bad. The staff was friendly, the vibe was relaxing, and the prices weren't bad at all..The first thing I will say is that it's hard to spot because it's literally behind the train stairs. (You'd have to see it to know what I'm saying) but the good thing is they have a sign with their name on it, so you can find them. When I walked in, no one greeted me. I had to walk up to the hostess for her to see me and she seemed stressed and busy, typing in her computer. Which I think is a little strange and unwelcoming. I'd suggest they move someone much closer to the front and possibly a new someone. When we were seated, the waitress was very kind and gave suggestions. Definitely made up for the first issues. If you check in, you get free broccoli tacos. I know it sounds gross but it's actually really good! You have no excuse but to get them. I ordered an appetizer as a meal because the entrees were pricey. That's why I deducted a star, plus they have a limited menu. The bean sprout and chilled scallop salad was a solid choice for a healthier option and it was a nice portion for one. I'd suggest this place but just watch out for price and limited selections..Came here for a Sunday lunch. I heard the fried chicken here was great so that's what I ordered. When the chicken came it looked perfect and the skin looked very crispy. But when you take the first bite you are underwhelmed and disappointed. The pieces of chicken were not the juiciest and the meat lacked flavor. All the flavor was in in the skin which was a disappointment. The cocktail I had was great. Would come again but maybe for drinks and another dish on the menu.Came here for brunch with a group of 5. We made a reservation but it wasn't too busy around 1 PM on a Saturday. I was apprehensive given the rating on here (3.5) but it was a good experience.Our server was excellent, fast, and attentive. The food was really good. Some of the flavor combinations seemed odd, but ending up to be delicious. I had the has with poached eggs. There are some pickled items in there that give the hash an interesting flavor. The eggs were well poached..What ended up being just a friendly meeting of children and parents in the park, turned out to be a chance meeting of one of the owners of this restaurant. SUPER friendly and so was his wife. The gentleman explained the type of food he had and that there was a bar. So as we left the park we went to the restaurant.  I got the chicken burger with fries to go. Between myself and my daughter, the fries never made it home...and neither did half the burger. It was delicious!!! We gotta go back for the broccoli taco..Was skeptical of the 3.5 rating but the food was great. Had the fried broccoli, half chicken and the gnocchi and everything was incredibly well prepared. Left there overly full. Will be back for sure..Was skeptical of the 3.5 rating but the food was amazing! Has the fried broccoli, half chicken and the gnocchi and everything was incredibly well prepared. Left there overly full. Will be back for sure..Did some research on this one before inviting friends out to brunch...Tip #1: make a reservation...this place gets crowded for Sunday brunch and I am happy I booked on OpenTable in advance! It was amusing to bypass the smug faces and eye rolls I encountered when we were seated as soon as we walked in! Tip #2: ask for alcohol...sure the drinks already come with it but watered down doesn't even begin to describe it. My Bloody Mary was spicy tomato juice and my friend's (first) mimosa was basically OJ. We spoke up on round two and that was quickly remediated.Tip #3: strawberries, cheese and fish just don't go together--skip the fish tacos or try being proactive with your requirements. I was also still very hungry after finishing mine so ended up buying a side of fries to fill me up. One friend of mine got the shrimp and grits...it was ok but I give No. 7 a 5 star rating for creativity with the dish--it looked like a bowl of ramen! The real 5 star (apparently) was the steak and fries; according to my friend ""it was the best steak and fries meal I've ever had in my 42 years!""--that's a heck of compliment!I won't be back, there are just too many great options in Brooklyn! P.S. the booth tables in the back need to get fixed...our table was bent, we were fearful our plates would slide..They're doing to-go bottled cocktails with some outdoor seating. So tasty, stop by and support. I went here pre-COVID for brunch and thought it was awesome..No 7 is one reason we're getting through this. Neighborhood feel, expert food and drinks. Fastest delivery I've had in weeks, accurate, and delicious."
"I first came here on National Donut Day(!), and I'm glad we have another DD I'm the Wash Heights area. Best part? 5 AM-11 PM, daily. Can't wait to utilize this late-hour-coffee-power when classes start up in the Fall.  They do run out of their selection of Munchkins by the end of the day and pass them out in Christmas boxes if you buy the 25-pack, which is weird, because they opened after Christmas...and it's only a couple months old. When I give them as gifts I'm worried people will think they're stale bc of the box, but that's a first world problem, so I'll deal.Small-ish and no Baskin Robbins, but clean and fast. In order to enter you will need to pass a gateway of stoop lingerers, but other than that, no complaints..I truly do not understand how difficult it is to fulfill an order. This specific Dunkin Donuts consistently screws up orders. They either leave items off or make drinks in correctly. I mean seriously, how difficult can it be. I feel they rushed through the orders and forget half of the items out of the bag. I'm going to suggest both Doordash and GrubHub drop them from rotation. You sell one specific product, it ain't rocket science!!!.This Dunkin Donuts is conveniently located between my house and the 1 train that I take to work. It feels like no matter when I come here I need to delegate ten minutes to even put in an order.The workers here are slow and there seems to always be some reason for that. If this place were so slow, I might be able to get my breakfast here more often..I ordered the special...Ice Latte, which normally comes as pictured in the advertisement. Well, MUHITUNNES was running the register. Never seen her before. The other ladies are very attentive and cordial. Back to MUHITUNNES, she asked if I wanted whip cream. I replied: ""Give me exactly what is in the advertisement"". Note: Whip cream is IN the advertiesment. Here comes MUHITUNNES handing me a NO WHIP CREAM latte. I shook my head and said: ""With whip cream"". She withdraws the order and began speaking in her native tongue with a loud voice. You don't need to understand a language when you can tell it's being spewed in a very derogative manner. This person was rude and upset because SHE GOT THE ORDER WRONG. I don't know the training process for these franchises but corporate is missing a major point. Customer courtesy is necessary. MUHITUNNES has a major lack there of. After she corrects my order I replied: "" Thank you"". The tone and mannerisms of my demeanor was cordial. To all the potential MUHITUNNES out there...don't take a rude path such as hers. We don't need nor warrant that kind of personality in our neighborhood. BTW this franchise hasn't even claimed ownership here, so that tells you how in tune they are with their customers. The place (Dunkin' Donuts) has been in existence for about 2yrs at this location. I enjoy the changing look of the neighborhood but poor customer service is deplorable..I don't know why I still stop in here. Its convenient in proximity to my apt, but I've had very few positive experiences here. My order has been wrong numerous times, and the bigger issue is timeliness of service. There have been times I've stayed at the register without being greeted for minutes, and even when I have been serviced it is so slow that im better off making coffee myself. And by making I mean fly to Colombia, pick some beans and grind up a drink. If you're in the area, take the walk to the 155th street dunkin"
"We cannot say enough GREAT things about Nick and Diamond Dog. We had our co-ed baby bash here yesterday as a private event before they opened.  First, they really helped us out somewhat last minute when our original venue bailed on us.  We scheduled and planned everything with Nick very quickly.  Our group was a little chaotic but Nick and his brother were so accommodating, the guests loved the drinks, and it was just a perfect party.  A lot of our group hung out after the party ended and we felt very welcomed to stay. My brother was even able to bring his dog, future canine cousin to our expected child, which was really important to him. Thank you Diamond Dog for a truly memorable day!.My new ""local spot"". I came here once before moving nearby and had a great night thanks to the crowd, drinks, and BYOF (bring your own food) policy. I have now gone to this place more times than I can count and I still leave wanting to go back each time. The cocktails are well made, so tasty, and affordable ($12). My favorite at the moment is the Neighborhood Threat. Some of the cocktails I've had here are right on par with swanky Manhattan specialty cocktail bars. They also have a beer and shot deal which is always a plus for me. Minus one star for that ONE bartender that always seems to be in a funky mood and acts as though anything you ask is a burden..I've always been curious about the unmarked, dimly-lit bar that is Diamond Dogs. We came here last night and it was quite packed. They had an outdoor space but it was just a little bit too cold to sit outside last night. Thankfully the tables were turning over fast enough. They have happy hour until 8 which we just made! They have a speakeasy vibe but they're a little too easy to find. They're also a bit more affordable. I'd classify them more as a ""subtle dive bar."" They don't serve food but they allow you bring it in. Since we were on a hot apple cider theme last night, we ordered the spiced one that they offered. It was delicious, and very spicy! I'm not sick but I'm sure I knocked out whatever preliminary germs I may have had. They offer an array of cocktails and draft brews. I would definitely like to return when it's a little more quiet so I can absorb the dark ambiance a bit better. I'm glad I can finally remove Diamond Dogs from my bookmarks now..What a perfect spot..I love a great cocktail and I surely was not dissapointed. Sweetheart is that BUD lite type of guy and the bartender(which if whom is also the owner) was more than helpful to assist in suiting his palate.The bathroom was nice and clean.I loved the decor and look very closely at the wall paper!We definitely will be stoping back in when we voyage to the city!I can only imagine how fun this bar is at night!.You may have difficulty finding Diamond Dogs, as there's no signage and it's got black curtains by the front, but just look for the block number and head in! Inside, you'll find such a chill little bar with the greatest outdoor patio farther back. I hung out there with a group of about ten and we got there around 5pm to lock down a table for a few hours. It gets busy, so if you're a big group, plan accordingly! And if the forecast predicts rain, head for the table with the umbrella! Bar atmosphere, but kid-friendly! The bartenders are super friendly and chill. John kept coming out to clean up our table and even share some of our snacks! Of course, the big benefit is BYOF. The bar doesn't have food itself. So get some food for the gang and relax, because if you can't do that here, you can't do that anywhere!.Cool spot, it can get packed later on at night. But they have sole solid drinks and cool bartenders. cant wait time come back here and try some of the other cocktails!.Dog friendly bar for me to bring my pup. Dustin, the bartender, had an insane amount of knowledge on cocktails and the beers offered. I was coming in from New Orleans two weeks ago and he made me feel so welcome. I was here for a week and came here multiple times. Can't wait to come back and see Dustin again and try more of the fabulous cocktails..Where to begin! I've loved coming to Diamond Dogs for drinks with my husband or friends since we moved here, but more recently I was looking for a venue to host my 30th birthday. I reached out to them on Instagram and they responded right away. They were able to open their entire bar + backyard 3 hours prior to opening just for my party for an extremely reasonable price. I was able to bring in my own food which was so great. Everyone had such a great time and couldn't stop telling me after what a great venue it was, how nice the bartenders/owners were who helped, and how much fun they had. It was the perfect place to gather with friends and family after such a tough year. Thank you SO much to the team there for everything..Great local spot. Superb cocktails, great beer list, chill backyard. What more do you want?.While the name Diamond Dogs will always remind me first of David Bowie, it is also the name of an unassuming bar on 31st ave of almost 3 years young. This place makes great cocktails, has a nice beer selection, including the local brewery SingleCut and is BYOF. Yes, you read it right: Great booze and Bring Your Own Food!Without much signage, Diamond Dogs is a dim, low key bar with casual seating and backyard access. One of the bartenders was actually the owner himself, Nick, who was amicable and welcomed us being first timers at the bar. We tried a few of their cocktails and they are solid and well crafted, which were nicely priced around $10-13 each. Holy Mountain, made with rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, walnut bitters and becherovka (a herbal bitter/liquor) reminded me of an Old Fashion. The Neighborhood Threat, a mescal cocktail with lemon, pineapple, cardamon bitter and demerara syrup (turbinado sugar) was very interesting. The cardamon bitter was quite memorable since it made the drink herbal and a kick of spices for me.  There are very few excuses to not check this place out if you are in the neighborhood.4.25 stars"
"It is s coffee shop Good location with parking spaceOpen 24/7Staff a little slow but okNice snd kooooool inside.I will never forget the time when I was called cheap and annoying by an employee working minimum wage for a corporation like Dunkin Donuts. Why was I called cheap? Apparently when you have 4 kids and need to share hot chocolate, that's considered cheap. It was ONLY THIS store that I truly ever had problems. The management was also horrible that they took no action to address my complaint or what I was saying. Instead they took my number and ignored me. Terrible Customer Service! This Dunkin also BARELY has any variety in it's Donuts and Munchkins even in the mornings! I DO NOT recommend this Dunkin Donuts at ALL! Please try you're best to avoid them. There are much better Dunkins near by like the one in Woodhaven and on 116 Liberty..I ordered croissant sandwich with egg and sausage (didn't taste great, a bit cold), hashbrown(it was falling apart as I was trying to eat it, not warmed enough, and didn't taste great either). The only thing I enjoyed was the ice coffee. I wasn't happy with my experience. The staffs seem friendly and nice. Also, not a lot of seating space. I'll come back to order a different food on the menu, and hope to have a better experience next time..I was going to Write such a bad review for this place but I realized they wasted enough of my time inside the store so what ima say is ....The worst Dunkin Donuts in USA Buy coffee and make it at home instead.In direct opposition too my normal lengthy writes, I'll keep it brief. In fact the catalyst for writing this review was the watery iced coffee I ordered today that spawned the need to write about it, along with tying in a few other observations.D&D is not my preferred coffee, I do not seek the locations out but will purchase from when necessary, and caffeine is necessary. Stores they are not short on and I find in each a minimal difference in the iced coffees, coffee delivery. Employees get a solid eight out of ten in efficiency, person ability and cleanliness of their appearance -- however the iced coffee gets no rating. What I was served today can not have a grade assigned as it had more taste resembles to an unwashed urn than freshly brewed coffee.I'm a reasonable man with a high tolerance for the common worker and their plight and I hope in no way my commentary shines a unfavourable light upon the fine workers I interact with regularly. However I do feel my days at this location are winding down..Morning coffee is a important ritual to the beginning of each and every day. The first sip of my first cuppa Joe is pure pleasure, you can't get that feeling back for another 24 hours.With the advent of corporate takeovers on products and services we consume daily, it appears I am the only one who takes issue. D&D's are as woven into neighborhoods as CVS's & 7/11's, creating barriers to entry for smaller start ups, shame on the patrons. Can't you see the original sin of man in full play, exploitation? These workers are on their feet all shift, hustling to feed the bots who promote this exposure, unbenonced to whom their munchkin dollars are really going to.The coffee is unpleasant to my taste buds..Such a shame that a big franchise like this serve such a poor cup of coffee. The service sucks first of all and then we got 2 coffee and it tastes like water n milk .. we ordered a cotton candy collatta and within 5-7 minutes it turns like lemonade. Shame on DD ...Awful Dunkin' Donuts the cashier didn't put whip on myDrink then made meRepay to charge me extra for whipped creamEven made my friends iced pumpkin spice latte wrong put toMuch iceWhen she even asked her not tooo then when we asked her toRemake it she said ""no, that's how it's made"" 8:00pm idkWho works this shift but awful customer service and the drinkAfter we tasted it tasted exactly like a iced coffee with whip creame.These people will charge you extra, screw up your order, and take 20 minutes just for a simple small order even when its not crowded. Save your money and hassle, the workers here are horrendous. If I could rate it 0 stars I would..We love Dunkin doughnuts. The coffee is always good and the only thing good Boston, is the Boston cream doughnuts. (Go Yankees!).Stopped in here for the first time 2 weeks ago with my husband and son. Ordered some donuts and munchkins to go. Cashier was prompt in taking and delivering our order. She remembered to give repeat it back to me and give me my receipt. The place seemed clean and it had a fair amount of customers at the tables and on line. It was your run of the mill Dunkin' Donuts experience. I would return with my family if we're nearby again."
"Bushwick Country Club is a place that has upper echelon feel. The garland, the web, the New Years vibe all year around, the bartender that pours the perfect pour. What more could you possibly want?Everyone is a regular, everyone gets the same strong pours, and everyone has a great time under the bartender @megleethompson . Fuck off, leave me alone, and have a bad time if you don't like good vibes, beer + shot combs and - wait dare I say it - a good time. This bar is where you want to go. This bar slaps..Literally a classic dive at this point, If you haven't been to Bushwich Country Club (BCC*), let me tell you why you're going to enjoy becoming a member........spoiler, it's for one of a few, select reasons, none of which are country-club-esque:*You like dive bars*You enjoy dirty mini-golf courses** *You like connect four/board games*You have friends who like connect four, almost too much*Photo booths are your thing*You really really really like cheap alcohol*You enjoy the company of good bartenders*Did I mention the cheap alcohol yet? Yeah, the booze is cheap. This place is as no-frills as they come, and I have very much enjoyed myself at the bar over the years. Come for the beer and shot special, stay...well mostly because of the beer and shot special, but also because the bartends are always super chill. _______*Yes I did, no I don't care**No offense to the groundskeeper, but there are more than a few divots on the back nine..I think I've been meaning to come here for the better part of a decade. Shows how long this place and myself have stuck around. But I never really had an excuse to go or none of my friends really ever willingly want to go into East Williamsburg for drinks. So someone I knew's birthday was being hosted here this week and this was my chance. After waiting an ungodly amount of time for the L train I was greeted with $4 tallboys of pbr (they have other drinks but this was my poison after downing margaritas for two and a half hours beforehand) and free cheezy poofs I will say the spot has a certain amount of charm. The backyard is a ramshackle set up of put put golf made out of statues constructed of shoddy pbr cans, creepy sculptures and gives off that redneck chic vibe. One weird thing did happen - someone spilled half my beer on a table. The drink continued to spillage over onto myself and the floor so we asked for napkins. The staff very begrudgingly asked if the napkins were for 'your face' or something else. . . . . so a no napkin bar. After we insisted that there was kind of a mess all over the table and floor they finally acquiesced with giving us a dish rag. I'm aware I'm getting what I paid for. They do have a happy hour believe it or not - 2 for 1 drinks before what was either 7 or 8pm on weekdays but I mean . . . . everything is pretty cheap here any time of the day/night. I kind of like it for what it is but the people in here are kind of young and it feels almost over-whelming after a bit. Oh, and they have a photobooth which is where they make their money - FIVE DOLLARS for a singular photo print. WHoooey..Came here for the first time a couple nights ago. Classic dive bar. Really friendly group of people drinking out back. Probably make this my new drinking spot. Very unpretentious and cheap drinks. Nice people and good service. Best dive I've found in this neighborhood. The bartender actually bought me several shots which is pretty uncommon these days. I think at the end of the night my tab was around $50 so I'm guessing he cut me a deal. Nice people, good neighborhood bar..The Bushwick Country Club is not in Bushwick and is not a Country Club. I Know....Confusing!The happy hour is 2 for one and it's a doozy!~Dino Toy Reminders with first drink. They are not your free toy. They are for the second drink. It is a total dive bar in the black heart of East Williamsburg. I like coming to this watering hole when I wanna change things up and don't want to spend too much dough.  This place also has a patio that can fit a good amount of people and ""mini golf"". I've never played mini golf here but that's not to say that people haven't attempted. There's some definite characters in this joint. People might try to start a verbal brawl. But just ignore the riff raff come with friends and get sloppy. You might not feel the best the next morning but you can put all the pieces together with your friends I mentioned to bring....important. There's no food here...unless your dinner could be a giant pickle and a bag a chips then yes, there is food. And cheezzzeee puffs! NomonomnomFor food and further libations you will have to go a couple doors down to their sister bar, the Starlight!.#They occasionally have free food. Check their #Instagram. The free Thanksgiving meal they had was really tasty. I remember a long time ago playing putt putt golf in the back..Perhaps this place should be called Bushwick Public Library. I said this because you can't be loud and you can't talk politics. A friend and I were having a conversation about the upcoming disaster of an election. According to another patron (who I later found out worked there), we were too loud. Rather than the bartender coming to us to tell us about our conversation (like an adult), she yelled at us from the other side of the bar to tone it down. It is a bar for christ's sake!This is my thing:1. If people are ""too loud"" then it should be the bartender, not her coworker who was not working, to ask the patrons to tone it down. 2. The patron (the bartender's coworker) said that some people want a quiet night. If that is the case THEN STAY HOME AND NOT GO TO A DIVE. Could it be that she wanted free drinks from her friend who was working the bar? 3. I wonder how many skinny, loud white girls are told that they are ""too loud""?4. Next time, if there is one, I guess we will debate about Keeping up with the Kardashians. So go here for free cheese puffs and silence. *eye roll*.What a fun, cheap mess! The ""Country Club"" part is definitely ironic.My friend dragged me to Bushwick Country Club on a Sunday night during my visit to NYC, and I had a blast! The place was dead being a Sunday and all, but we had fun chatting with the bartender and chilling on the couch.The drinks were cheap, and the bartender was very friendly - we had all his attention, so my experience may be a little biased.Overall, a fun place to hang out with friends without breaking the bank..Great dive bar. Awesome bartender John holding down the fort. One man show and he did an incredible job. Came here for my friend's 31st birthday and we had a great time. Those pickle back shots... now I'm hooked..It's 2:30am and I'm listening to Slipknot and having picklebacks while looking behind the bar where you can apparently purchase a pregnancy kit.  Outstanding..It's 2:30am and I'm listening to Slipknot and having a picklebacks while looking behind the bar where you can apparently purchase a pregnancy kit.  Win."
"Very nice ambiance and the servers are extremely nice. The drinks were good too and 100% will come back  the seating at the back is to die for!!.I used to be a regular here (paying them thousands of dollars in patronage & basically keeping them afloat during the depths of winter 2020 when very few people were going to NYC restaurants). However after truly knowing this place, I have to warn others to stay away from here for 2 reasons:1. They may secretly overcharge you for your drink without telling you.2. They will overhear your conversations and talk about it behind your back.Like most people, I trusted that the waiter would correctly charge my credit card after I left, but to my surprise when I checked my credit card account a week later, I noticed that I was overcharged by over 50% on a date night. I came back to talk to the manager about it, thinking it must've been an accident. The manager said he'd fix it for me but didn't do anything so I had to come by 3 times total to get the bill fixed. When I came back the last time to politely discuss it with them, the waiter screamed at me and the manager made false accusations of me based on what he and his staff overheard me say on a date (not only was this irrelevant to the overcharge, but it also shows that they were constantly listening in on private convos, which is a HUGE invasion of privacy and not professional). Eventually the manager did give me my money back but it took 3 times and receiving verbal abuse/false accusations from the staff/management. I was their #1 loyal customer (literally) but not any more. If this doesn't sound like the experience you want to go through, I would recommend staying away..From the outside, Zinc Bar doesn't look like much, but trek down a few steps and you're in a bygone era. You don't need to hide your alcohol in the hollowed out heel of a shoe because the bar is fully stocked and the bartenders are pretty good at keeping up with a pre-show crowd. My friend and I came here for comedians Krystyna Hutchinson and Wendy Starling's comedy show Glamourpuss. The performance space is great and there's not a bad seat in the house. The waiter service was also pretty good and we weren't without an empty glass for more than a few minutes. I was a little surprised that they don't have a bigger wine selection, just seems like the place where wine would be a heavily featured drink. The bar area is quite cushy to hang out and there are a couple of places for group seating, but perhaps get there a bit early if you are in a group to make sure you plant yourself before the show. I'm definitely interested in checking out some jazz shows here soon!.Looking for a wonderful and clean place that has live music? This little bar is a really nice place to try out. Walk in to a nice cozy space and then lies the bar...then onto the DJ area...then onto the sitting for the stage. When you come in especially on Tuesdays you don't know who you may see. Anyone from Anderson Paak to Casey Benjamin. The drinks were pretty good. I don't think they serve food but honestly I had already ate right before coming so I was worried and if you do happen to get hungry while there, you can always wave and there is a few food places on each block surrounding this place. Very nice location to stop and have a few drinks, chat it up, listening to the dJ (get a few twerks in) and listen/watch the love show!.We went here looking for a chill place to grab and drink and listen to jazz and it was an unpleasant experience. First the venue was hot and dank in the middle of December. It smelled musty. Second, when we sat the bar, it was wet and dirty and for the entire time we sat their, no bartender made even an attempt to wipe it down. We ordered drinks and the they tasted horrible and I was completely grossed out by the bartender who kept shaking liquor from his hands and fingers versus washing or wiping his hands. Disgusting. The gross atmosphere took away from the whole music experience..Ordered Moscow Mule and it tasted like iced ginger water. They also mixed up our bill with another table. :/.Oddly but my boyfriend didn't like  this place while I enjoyed my time.So, Zinc Bar was a local venue for jazz music. To get in, we paid entrance fee- 20$. Interior of the place put me in the cozy mood. The whole place had dominant color of red and burgundy and I loved dimmed lights.My boyfriend complained about the place being dirty, and there was some true in his words. The tables were not wiped and the floors were messy; however, in the dark it was hard to notice it lolAnother minus, the music bar didn't hold  expensive alcohol such as Crowne Royal and some types of scotches. The place was definitely more casual than upscale. I still liked the place even my bf wanted to leave after 30 minutes being there. I would love to give the second chance to this place and suggesting to others to visit this place and make your own opinion..What a chill, awesome place. Live music, hot bourbon apple ciders, and heating pads in your outdoor seating  This is your go to place in the village for some cocktails and catching up. I will be coming back for more!.This is a hidden gem! I've taken a few people here for a cocktail before brunch or dinner. It's quiet and a cute set up with comfortable chairs and tables, with barriers in between so you feel safe. The espresso martini is amazing! Would definitely recommend.When I was seventeen, I knew I wanted to spend my free time in jazz bars, with lush curtains, and expensive cocktails. Zinc Bar does it for me everytime. It's a small bar, but the music is always good. The back is the performance space which you can pay a cover to get into, or you can sit in the front and listen and chat.It's perfect for an intimate date with yourself, or a significant other.  All the drinks are named after jazz stars or singles. It's comforting."
"I come here for the Tres Leche because it's simply delicious. I'm not a fan of any of the other food.It could use a bit more seasoning but hey it's nyc and we like to make room for every taste bud.I order via delivery and sometimes they forget my extra guac.This spot is a hole on the wall. Overall their food it's OKAY. It's very Mexican not Tex mex. However I have found some inconsistent recipes. Steak nachos, if lucky a lot more steak little chips. Not so lucky little of everything almost not meat. The beef stew known as caldo de res súper very greasy unless you want to die of a heart attack then eat this. The shrimp cocktail it's literally pico de gallo overly cover ketchup sauce & the shrimp you can forget about it. One shrimp cut into 5 pieces. You do the math. So I know times are hard but come on. Do not order kids meal from here probably frozen from ages ago..Best spinach and cheese Quesadillas...came with salsa verde and spice as well as a salad. Very fresh and a good price as well, thank you!.This is how my ""enchiladas"" were delivered. Absolutely unacceptable and I want a refund..I don't know how this place has horrible reviews, I've been ordering from here for a year now and I honestly have no complaints. People must be mistaking Taqueria Guadalupe for Taqueria El Barrio. My favorite foods to order is the cheese quesadilla and the Veggie tacos with guac on the side. As someone who is part Mexican I can appreciate how authentic this place is. From the quality to the generous portions. The cheese quesadilla is always so perfectly melted to perfection, The veggie tacos come in a perfect portion loaded with peppers, onions, tomatoes and cilantro. Not to mention it actually comes with sour cream and lemons.My orders always come before the estimated time, Customer service is always excellent. I def highly recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food..Walked in on a Saturday evening (the place was empty).  The hostess stared at me wordlessly, stuffing plastic bags with menus.  I smiled and waited for her to greet me, seat me, even just acknowledge me.  Finally :Me : ""Hi..... ? Are you open for dinner?"" Her [practically rolling her eyes] : ""Yes.""  [continues stuffing bags]Me : ""........Cool, could I see a menu?  Should I seat myself?""Her : [throws me a menu, continues stuffing bags]Can't speak for the food; I took my business elsewhere as they didn't seem to want it.  I understand many local spots are gearing more toward delivery than dine-in, but no wonder the place was completely empty on a Saturday night..This shit is so good. Good for vegans or non vegans. The the service is pretty good the ladies are sweet. The tamarindo drink is good!!! Overall I'm definitely coming back. oh yeah and happy Cinco De Mayo!!!.I'm from Los Angeles so I know a little about Mexican food.I ordered the Steak, Chicken and Vegetables Enchiladas.Instead I got the vegetables, vegetables and vegetables enchiladas. ? Took forever (i.e.- 3 people who ordered after me got their food before i did) but whatever, It  looked good (see pic) and tasted decent.  Also got a beer, which was $2.50.  Steak, Chicken, Vegetables Enchiladas (aka - vegetable, vegetable, vegetable enchilada) was $11. If my math is correct, $11 + $2.50 = $13.50. Gave her $20. Only got $5.00 back. Maybe I didn't factor in the taxes.Ordered a 2nd beerGave her a $10Only got $5.00 back???Food = 3 starsService = 0.5 starsAverage = 2 stars if you round up.Ordered a burrito last week and thought it was decent so I came back last night just to order a small side of rice and beans. I was told I could get a large side of rice and a large side of beans for $8 and that there aren't small sides, so I ordered that. The cashier then brought out a small side of mixed rice and beans and said that's what I bought. I explained that she mislead me into paying for half of what I was told I was buying and her only answer was ""Oh...no"". I explained again that it's not cool to mislead a costumer from what they ask for just to give them half as much food as they are told they're ordering, and again I get another ""Oh...no"".Looked online at their menu to see the prices once I got home and rice and beans are only supposed to cost $3.50.There's a reason this restaurant is the worst rated Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood..Absolutely terrible. We ordered through Grubhub and waited an hour and 35 minutes past the estimated delivery before we got our food, which arrived cold and soggy. We called twice while waiting for the food and were told that the food was coming in ""10 minutes"" each time. After talking with Grubhub customer service, the restaurant offered to come pick up the cold food and replace it with hot food. We said no to this offer since it was after 10pm and we were not interested in waiting for the restaurant once again. They said they would not give us any refund unless they could come pick up the cold food, which just added insult to injury after having waited so long in the first place. Take the bad reviews you see here seriously."
"Honestly this place is not pleasing to look at outside and in...BUT it's not badI've had a few of their fruit teas and they're pretty good and priced well at $4 i believe.They pastries are aight, about $1 a piece. Had the hot dog scallion bun, a pork bun (which was pretty sweet), and like a ham and egg bun. All were aight.Def would recommend the fruit teas for sure!.After a very late start to a beautiful day from a very late retire to bed the night before, which resulted my extreme tardiness to Canto and Mandarin classes.  On an empty stomach to sit through nearly three full hours of Yyut6 ping3 system for Cantonese and Pinyin for Mandarin.  In hopes of obtaining my favorite guk Caa1 Siu1 Baau1 叉燒包, the staff was blantly rude to serve me in rushing me to get out of his hair.  The dude shot me a rude scrowl look upon my payment as the warm Chinese customer service hospitality is non-existent!I did not feel welcomed or well attended to.  When requesting a business card, the dude either did not understand my Canto oral skills or White Swan Bakery does not have any.Fay Da Bakery has better customer service and high quality baked goodies on-the-go!.I stopped into White Swan for a quick snack and drink. It's a small and cramp space and its pretty cluttered and disorganized. The pastries weren't labeled (with names or prices).I was greeted by a nice Chinese man who was smiling and eager to help. I saw a drink called Horlick on the menu, and having never heard of it, I ask what it was. He showed me that it was powdered drink and I asked him to prepared it on ice for me. Apparently, it is similar to Ovaltine (which is also popular in these bakeries), but not chocolate-flavored. It was an okay drink.I also ordered a standard slice of a vanilla roll. The cream actually tasted a little different than most other places. I can't put my finger on what it was, but there was something better about it. I may have to return to try it again. For the drink and roll $3.00 is a bit more than most bakeries, I don't know exactly how it breaks down because of the unclear pricing. But I wonder if I overpaid a little. White Swan is an okay place to grab something and go, but it's not a comfortable setting to sit and enjoy your drinks and dessert..I have to agree with other reviewers that this bakery is all cramped and have weird stuff on display. Their buns selection is very standard to a point where it is quite boring. I think there are about 10 different kinds. I never try their buns actually because they just look that tasty lol. I did try their milk tea and bubble tea before and they are nothing special. But they are not bad either. If you are around the area, and you need a cheap cup of milk tea, White Swan is not a bad place. I still am skeptical about their buns....Very dirty. Buns seem to be made somewhere else; saw a man unload them and put them into the store. Coffee is meh..Ignore all the other comments here written 6 years ago. I enjoy the pastries here and place gets many customers buying bakery items here. It's worth a visit. The manager is very nice to me and other customers..No bueno. Dirty inside. Small selection. You can stay away from this bakery."
"I went to try the Thai place and parked in front of an Italian ice store and said I'll try it on the way back. When I walked in and saw the name I was like wow, I wonder if this is the same place that used to come to my job in a truck. Well I was SO IMPRESSED with this place! The flavors are AMAZING and actually better than the ones on the truck if it's the same group. I went with margarita and mango scoops and the second was a rainbow cookie and coconut. Well on my drive home I couldn't wait since I hadn't had anything all day. This was UNBELIEVABLE!!!! I was like OMG I want more. I had to stop myself or I would have ate both before I got home It's right around the corner from the main road just near the train track so you could miss itI suggest make the effort to GO HERE over The ""OTHER PLACE""..A rough surf and no sightings of hunky lifeguards convinced me it was better to eschew risking life and limb and not venture further than my ankles into the waters of Rockaway beach to cool off.  We decided a visit to this ice cream parlor was a far better way to get revived from heat prostration.This charming shop serves frozen desserts with a dose of saucy humor. It's in the funny bathroom signs, the funny outdoor signage and in little touches in the decor. Surprisingly clean for a place that gets good beach traffic, this rather spacious location of the chain whips out excellent ices. Frosty, and intensely flavored, their ices provided just the jolt we needed to jump start us out of our heat induced languor. Two scoops for $3 gets you a good portion of Italian ice. We had the mango and watermelon in one cup and the chocolate and passion fruit in another. All four flavors tasted fantastic. They have the best chocolate ice I have had so far. Uncle Louie G has so many flavors in both ice cream and ices, you could try a different one a day and I not have tried them all after a month.There are tables and a long, padded bench for customers to enjoy their ices and ice cream in A.C. The gentleman who served us was one of the happiest workers I've ever seen in an ice cream shop, as he sported a huge smile for each customer. Maybe he understood the key to happiness during a heat wave was to be surrounded by frozen, sweet treats. Maybe he just liked helping to reanimate wilted people!.Yummy. So many choice of icees. It's sweet. Literally.  From kiwi to margarita flavors.  Very delightful. I mean it. And the price maybe a little pricey but for the tastefully cold treat its worth it. The staff were friendly. They took their time with my order and even let me try different flavors.  Pretty awesome . Extremely and highly recommended..Uncle Louie G, pronounced by many as Uncle Luigi, however you are called, you still make some delicious ices.  I have been here on two occasions and place is roomy, and you can stay and enjoy or take it with you to go.  This time I took it to go.  I opted for a two scoop of ice that only cost me $3.00 and tax.  Very affordable and you get a good size product.I originally had wanted a Rocapulco, but they did not have any soft serve.  What's an ice/ice cream place without the soft serve?  The Rocapulco is supposed to have soft serve, ice, then another layer of soft serve with your choice of flavored ice for $5.50.  Well, that was the only reason I couldn't give it a 5 stars.Staff are friendly and nice, they also sell cookies in the back and some other pastry items.  They seem to have more combinations and varieties then other Louie Gs.  They are also very patriotic here at the Far Rockaways and supportive of our local FDNY and NYPD.  Nice to see and are well represented at Louie G with flavored ice such as FDNY Cherry and NYPD Blue. Yeah!.Waited for more than 10 minutes without being approached or spoken to.Never in my life have I ever felt so disrespected and ignored as a customer. I've been to other locations without a problem - stand in line and you get serviced. At this location I didn't even get a hello but others were serviced all around me -I'll take my money elsewhere..Absolutely love this place, the staff are so sweet and welcoming.My boyfriend and I went over to try fried ice cream for the first time and it was delicious!.HAPPY LOYAL CUSTOMER. They asked where I wanted my hot fudge, on top or below the ice cream. Who does that? Only ANGELS. Delicious. Don't come to Rockaways without stopping here..Cozy neighborhood spot with awesome ice cream and ices. Its a chain establishment but privately owned which gave it that feel. We had the peanut butter cookie dough and cherry vanilla in a cup. Delicious!.Had their Italian ice along Rockaway Beach from one of the cartsI tried the watermelon, but it tasted very artificial. It was refreshing but nothing spectacular. The server was nice, and I recommend trying the lemon since everyone else seemed to like it!.Store closed for the season but walked by on Halloween and they opened for the day and were serving all the trick or treaters for free. Very classy! Love this place! Can't wait for summer to get my ice cream!"
"My go to place for Root Beer Floats during the summer! They have a great variety of flavors, and the employees are very sweet, and friendly. The only downside is that the place only accepts cash, which is a drag sometimes when I only carry my debit card on me. The Root Beer floats are made with A&W root beer which is my favorite! I can't wait to come back when it gets warmer..Cannoli Italian ice had chunks of cannoli in it and was delicious! Vanilla chip Italian ice was good but tasted more artificial than the cannoli. Cherry Italian ice was a little too sweet and I was not a fan of the candied cherries in it, but that's just me.Definitely coming back for the cannoli ice!.This place is truly a hidden gem. I can't believe how many times I've driven past Isabella's, for years, and haven't noticed it until just recently. They have so many flavors of ice cream, Italian ice, soft serve, and milk shakes. It took me a good minute to go through the menu before deciding on the coffee and spumoni ice cream in a sugar cone. I will definitely be back. They serve ice cream from Uncle Louis G's for those who are fans, but don't want to make the trek out to the Rockaways.Unfortunately, they did not have soft serve when I went there. Hopefully this isn't a common occurrence..My family's go to spot for Italian ices anytime we are in New York! The coconut flavor is the best  it has real coconut pieces inside..Friendly staff but most ice cream here is a blend of vanilla and food coloring. My pistachio ice cream tasted like vanilla with blue food coloring mixed in. Butter pecan also tasted like vanilla with yellow dye. Not impressed..In the middle of our off-the-beaten-track Queens food crawl, we ended up at Rosa's Pizza, across the street. While trying to select a slice of pizza, I saw a sign for Italian ices at Rosa's, with a long list of flavors, and reminded my visiting friend that she hadn't yet had an Italian ice on this trip. After we finished our pizza, we went back to the counter and asked for some Italian ice. The first dude we asked was nonplussed, and reacted as though no one had ever asked for Italian ice before. Finally, he directed us to a woman who told us there was only lemonade left. So we settled for lemonade, and had a perfectly good (but not particularly satisfying Italian ice).I don't know Maspeth that well, so you can imagine my surprise when, as soon as we emerged from Rosa's Pizza, I saw Isabella's across the street, with its long list of flavors. Of course we had to try Isabella's too, but now, at the tail end of this food crawl, we didn't have much room left, so we resolved to share an Italian ice. Isabella's was intent on foiling us though -- that day, they had buy one get one free on small sized Italian ices -- and this offer didn't extend to the kid's size, which was the size I actually could have finished alone comfortably. So we each walked out with a small Italian ice, and took a lid, as though we wouldn't finish the whole thing within 5 minutes anyway.I don't regret finally getting my pistachio, even though I probably shouldn't have finished it. What I did regret was not trying to eat dessert here first..Had to get a party bucket as you can see in the attached photo and the staff, Taylor was so kind and patience. We felt so bad because it was a lot of scoops. Thank goodness for the tip jar. Make sure you tip them! Thank you so much again, Taylor!.Friendly and delicious! My on begs us to visit often and he cannot wait until they reopen for the spring and summer..Where have you been all my liiiife? They have a huge selection of ice creams and ices and I'm sure all of them are delicious. I was a little overwhelmed looking at everything, but the girls at the counter were patient and let us sample a bunch of things. I went for their sweet ice creams, and my boyfriend went for their fruity ices. Here's what we got: - Honeydew Ice: sooooo good! And so refreshing on hot days. I can definitely taste the honeydew flavor. - Orange Ice: well, it tasted like orange! Next to the honeydew, this one just tasted okay. - Cappuccino Chunk: the chunks are espresso! Coffee is one of my favorite flavors, and this one did not disappoint. The cappuccino flavor is rich, and all the espresso chunks only helped it. - Smores: I'm a sucker for anything Smores. The ice cream had chunks of chocolate and ribbons of marshmallow all throughout. Possibly my favorite Smores ice cream. My boyfriend and I both got smells and did half of a flavor in each. I was surprised that it came with so much. In a great way though :).Awesome neighborhood ice cream spot! Wish I would have tried this place sooner! Stopped by tonight after 9PM and they were still opened! There were two girls working there and it looked like they were getting ready to clean up for the night. They have many flavors for ice cream and Italian ices. They also make milk shakes, but it wasn't available at the time we stopped by. I had one scoop of pistachio ice cream in a sugar cone. And guess what!? It costs only $2! Amazing price for delicious ice cream! :) It beats getting the fancy ice cream in Manhattan! Looks like I'll be stopping by here more for the rest of the summer!Even after we were leaving, we saw people dropping off their kids to pick up some ice cream. And other kids were riding their bikes there and leaving them outside to run in and get ice cream at night! Guess it is a popular dessert spot in the neighborhood!"
"Ordered delivery which came slightly early, super efficient. Fish was fresh (fresher than many takeout sushi places in nyc trust me) and portions were decent. Reasonable price - free spring roll with orders over $30 on grubhub. Overall a good option for takeout :).Personally enjoy this place, we live 5 mins away and the order is always delivered hot and fresh ! Reasonable price point and better food in the area compared to Ariyoshis  no shade tho, keeping it real.I have never eaten *in* this restaurant but it has been my go to for ordering in. The sushi has been consistently fresh and flavorful & the other food we have ordered from here (salmon bento box, Katsu chicken) has all been delicious. Definitely recommend!!.Food: 3.5/5Ordered sushi and sashimi for two. It was just ok. It came with 15 pieces of sashimi, 10 pieces of sushi, a hako roll and a summer blue crab roll. Some of the sashimi pieces were tasty and fresh but some were extremely fishy and unappealing. The hako roll was crunchy and well rolled but the blue crab roll fell apart every time I tried to eat it. The soybean sheet was dry and very flimsy. It was underwhelming. Not the best but not the worst sushi. I would reconsider ordering from this place again..Delivery: 4/5Ordered on seamless. The delivery came within the promised time..I was looking at a way to diversify my lunch options when working from home and only recently discovered that there may be good sushi options in Sunnyside/Woodside.  There aren't any good ones near my office.  Had a hard time finding some near my old apartment, but I think I finally found a decent place here.Jungo has a pretty good lunch deal.  For $10, you get 2 rolls and soup/salad.  The reason I chose this place was because they have sweet potato rolls.  Those are my utmost favorite vegetarian sushi rolls.  I also got the avocado tempura because, why not?, and miso soup and off I ate.Loved both the sushi rolls.  Sweet potato had that extra bounce to it.  But the avocado tempura rolls were just as good too.  Miso soup was alright, but it was probably quite much for me.  Probably didn't need it because the sushi rolls were plenty for me.I'll be back..I've been a customer for years so it's pains me to write this but I just found a small worm in my sashimi. I luckily found it before eating that piece but I had already eaten a few other pieces so I'm hoping nothing else had worms in it. At first I pulled it out thinking it was string or some kind of vein left over from a shrimp but no, it moves. I will be uploading videos too. I will NEVER order from here again. Be safe everyone.The quality of sushi is the best ever and sashimi is thick enough and juicy!!! The rolls are amazing I would order this platter again!!!.The salmon pizza from here is delicious - crunchy on the bottom, delicious salmon and sauces on the top. We've also had several other dishes - udon, salmon avocado roll, eel cucumber - all were decent but only salmon pizza was the stand out. We get delivery from here only, never been to the store, and the delivery has been quick and yummy!.I ordered from Jungo when they first opened and was a bit underwhelmed with the sushi so I didn't order again.  My neighbor had mentioned they order from them frequently so I decided to give them another shot recently.  My overall thoughts - unless it's a basic California roll, I don't think I'll be ordering sushi, especially the special rolls.  For the price, how they look and taste it just was sub par for me.  They have improved from when they first opened but is still just not doing it for me.  Their miso soup however was bomb!  I liked the chicken katsu enough to order again when I get the craving and chicken karaage (under Japanese chicken nuggets on their menu) and crab rangoon was tasty too.  They have a really extensive menu so next time I'll try something different..Shrimp cali roll was good, snow crab in the roll was not fresh at all. Didn't realize it at first because the sriracha and chili garlic I added on top masked it but when I tasted the snow crab by itself you could tell it was old. Snow crab is sweet and has a distinct flavor. Didn't even taste like crab it had picked up a fridge like flavor. Not cute."
"Long wait time -- I waited at least 5mins to place my order. Disappointing menu -- they don't offer malted milkshakes (which other locations do)Order prepared incorrectly -- I was served a shake made of the wrong ice cream.Disappointing all around..I normally don't start a review off with 'whoever was working here last night 8/15/17 should be fired from their job'. But now I apparently am that Yelp asshole. I came up to the window after an event last night. We both had $5 off ice cream cards from a promotion for Baskin Robbins. My friend ordered a cup of oreo ice cream and asked for rainbow sprinkles. I asked for mint chip. It should have been simple enough. He gave us both of our ice creams, kept the cards and said nothing. I asked if we could have our cards back and he said no. He refused to tell us how much our ice creams actually cost. Also, the fuck face put sprinkles on mine which I did not want. First world problems. But I asked if I could have fudge instead and he said No. My friend got oreo cheesecake which was not what she ordered. She actually hates cheesecake and asked if he could give her correct order. He yelled at us and said no and that we got all the free shit we were getting. So we threw the uneaten oreo ice cream back into his cubby hole window and stormed off. Excellent customer service. Really setting a great example for Baskin Robbins..Meh, the convenient location and decent scoop didn't make up for the really awful service..A very, very sad Baskin Robbins/Dunkin Donuts. Almost no ice cream left. Listless workers. Dirty tables and floors..It gets kind of crowded here in the mornings, but the service staff is nice and the ice cream is on par. Convenient location..Came to this location at 10.40 on 20/6/17 & was greeted by a very rude employee at the window. He approached us simply to say no ice cream after 10pm then slammed the window shut. Did not come back to take any orders or apologise. Was very dismissive. As a tourist, I'm very disappointed..I just came here for an Oreo milkshake. The server, named Raymond, was harassing a customer and cursing her out. When she left, he refused to take anyone else's order. I ended up leaving without my milkshake."
"Hey Y'all! Hope your day is going well! Mine is. Okay, so I was in NYC exploring and suddenly had a craving for a coffee... but not just any coffee... a pumpkin spiced latte. Firstly, I can barely control myself with pumpkin spiced ANYTHING! And every other commercial that Ive seen in the past 8 hours is the the Dunkin' pumpkin spiced coffee flavors. Ya girl HAD to get one. This Dunkin' Donuts was very clean, barely a line, and the team was friendly. I ordered my latte and it was delicious! Just right! Not too sweet and not too tart. The wait time was around 6 minutes (but this is because I ordered two coffees and food). I would come here again and again!.Pretty cool Dunkin cafe. it's located right behind the P.C. Richards & Son on Flatbush avenue and Atlantic Avenue ( right near the Barclays Center). I wouldn't mind coming back here, I know their competition right across the street inside the Atlantic terminal mall, Starbucks cafe'. it could get very busy here especially in the morning rush hour and noon lunch break hour and evening rush hour . (Especially when there an event going on at the Barclays center its get very busy here  ). the sales associate seem to be very nice and cool I wouldn't mind coming back here. during the summer months I usually get a Caramel iced latte' and a French Curler . and the winter months I get hot cocoa or hot tea !!!!!very convenient by MTA transportation:subway  :2,3,4,5,Q,B,D,N,R-Trains. Atlantic Avenue & Flatbush avenues (Barclays center) and Long Island Rail Road (l.i.r.r)-Atlantic Terminal stop.andC-train. Lafayette streetandG-train.Fulton streetbuses:B41,b103,b63,b37,b38,b65,etc buses.The guy who served me was very polite and precise which made the process quick & easy, also he gave me 2 separate bags without hesitation on request for 4 donuts making things easier for me once i got to my predetermined destination, also the line was super fast it had to be around 6:20-7pmish. I am really grateful for service like this thank you good sir !.This place needs to get it together. They always have a line or they're out of something. They're really trying to make it all about the coffee because that's usually the only thing they tend to have available. The line is aggravating and if you are there to simply get ice cream you still have to stand on the same line, get a receipt then wait by the ice cream cooler like a lost, sad puppy until someone slides over to help you. The cash register right next to the ice cream cooler definitely has to be there just for display because instead off dividing the lines and creating some form of order - coffee on one side and ice cream on the other- it sits there and collects dust. And the seating areas look like they barely come around to maintain the areas. I'm glad I don't frequent there too often especially since they don't even care that you're miserable with their service. And try to avoid that place late at night because its homeless central for the ones that can't get into the train station..They have nothing available. I tried to get an iced coffee with cream and mocha and they couldn't do that . Then I asked for a sausage egg and cheese on a bagel and he said also nothing available. At least let the long line of people waiting on slow service know that all you have practically is regular coffee. Multiple people in front of me also couldn't get what they ordered..Can't go wrong with Dunkin at 5am! Definitely needed that egg cheese sandwich. Employees are also nice and friendly! This is my favorite Dunkin location since 2010 :).I went to buy coffee I asked for 5 coffees but I changed my mind and I gave the lady that I would better give 1 dosena faith donuts and canselara the cafes made me face and I say that the donuts did not cost more but I bother their attitude for I go  to pay I am not asking for free.Worst Dunkin, dirty. Service is slow and they just don't care... inconsistent flavoring every time I order, and forgot about my order 3 times and asked what I needed as I just stand there..The service at this place is very unprofessional. I ordered a medium coffee Dark and 8mins later was given a medium coffe BLACK. When I stated to thew young lady named ""Khadijah"" that dark coffee has a little cream/milk/half&half in it. She began to argue with me telling me dark coffee does not have anything in it just coffee. I then told her she was describing BLACK COFFEE and I asked for Dark. She continued to argue with me and refused to give me her name when I asked her for it. I even asked a gentleman that was also working there for her name and he ignored me. It wasn't until I th threatened to take their pictures an older lady appeared and gave me Khadijah's name. Khadijah needs training on customer service and on how to make coffee. I will NOT be returning to this place..After missing my train, I decide to come to DD since it's 11 PM on a Thursday, 26 degrees, and I've got an hour to kill. All I want is a decaf coffee to keep me warm, yet not keep me up, since I have work in the morning.  They have no decaf coffee. I look at the man behind the counter like he told me he just raped my grandmother. Shocked and horribly disgusted. A Dunkin  Donuts with no decaf coffee. I hate to be the person to point this out, but isn't coffee kind of their thing?  To make the experience even more enjoyable, there were a few captains of industry dead asleep in chairs nearby, making sipping my decaf tea by the window that much more special."
"Gosh. The best. The staff are super kind, thoughtful, just incredible hosts. They handled our table of 13 with aplomb. Anything wood oven fired will be fantastic. My branzino (fillets), served with roasted zucchini, eggplant, spinach, and sweet peppers was awesomely good. The ingredients were fresh across the board, slightly smoky from the oven. Fish is really easy to overcook at high temps, especially when thinly filleted, but mine was PERFECT. The style of cooking at Ortomare isn't Michelin-level fine dining of course; preparations are straightforward. But in terms of freshness and deliciousness, I don't think one could find better fish at Le Bernardin. Wood oven fired pizzas were also very good, the crusts a touch less elastic than what I understand Neapolitan style to be, but just the right thickness, a bit ""wet"" in the center with some cornicione. The toppings were in great balance. Salads were made with excellent, fresh ingredients. We had one with fennel; ripe, but firm pear; and freshly shaved parmesan. It was perfectly dressed with something light, acidic, and refreshing. They were able to make eggplant parmesan for my FIL off-menu. (Great, by the way!) And they were tolerant of / kind to the littles in our group. Our pasta eaters all enjoyed their meals. Be aware that you'll get a high sauce to pasta ratio, which isn't entirely authentic, but pleased our non-Italian crowd. There's heated outdoor seating, high ceilings indoors. What a wonderful neighborhood establishment! We can't wait to come back..this place had good vibes the moment my sister, mom and I walked in.the staff thanked us immediately for coming, especially on a frigid January night. we were craving authentic Neapolitan pizza, and Ortomare did not disappoint. we ordered pizza (margherita & vegetariana) and salads (beet & arugula and fennel). they accommodated us when we asked to eat everything together - really nothing better than fresh salad with warm pizza. the ingredients spoke for themselves!oh, and we topped it off with homemade tiramisu, which was delightful.what a special restaurant.This place was a beautiful surprise. Searching for ""Best family run Italian food Upper Wes side"" Ortomare came up #1 and all the great Yelp reviews made it a ""must go"" for dinner. The ratings are 100% on point.It's delightful, nicely decorated and has a nice neighborhood feel. Located on 109 & Columbus in the Upper West Side, It's a little higher than I usually venture for food, but so worth the trip.Service is wonderful. Giovani took really good care of us. We ordered 2 dishes to share, and they split the dishes on two plates with evening asking. Such a nice touch.Started with the Ortomare - Grilled vegetables with calamari and shrimp. Excellent! Photos shown are the portions split, so there's plenty for two.Main course was the evening special. Calamari, shrimp and clams in a light sauce served over pasta.  Sauce was so good and not overpowering. I t was a perfect dish.Chocolate Lava cake was rich and served warm with a scoop of vanilla gelato. The perfect ending to a fabulous meal.If you're looking for truly good homemade Italian food in a nice setting with an authentic family feel...head to the Upper West Side and go to Ortomare. You will be very happy..So we ended up here after one of our hour long searches for the right restaurant. By all accounts, this should have been a home run. And I'm sure my husband probably like it a tad more than I did.There wasn't anything particularly bad, as much as there wasn't anything particularly good. Service was so-so considering that it wasn't a very busy night. But, what seemed noticeable was that the tables that ordered wine were getting the good service, while we, who don't drink (but tip probably better than most big wine drinkers ever do) were left mostly ignored and forgotten about. I mean, how many times do you have to get up to get the attention of the owner/server/manager to ask for bread or to get another bottle of sparkling water before it becomes incredibly annoying?The food was decent, though nothing particularly memorable and nothing I'd run back for again..We stumbled upon this gem while in the neighborhood and I was blown away by their pizzas, especially the Diavola! The crust is perfectly chewy, sauce is nice and fresh, and they use good ingredients. We were greeted very nicely by the gentlemen as well and can't wait to go back to nibble on more pizza deliciousness!.Celebrated our actual anniversary dinner here 3 Saturdays ago. We were enjoying the beautiful day in the park and was torn between going to our favorite Italian restaurant or discovering a new one in the area. The wonderful reviews led us here. First impressions, charming restaurant. They had a great outdoor setup but it was a bit chilly that early evening so we decided to dine inside and loved the interior design even more. The woodfire oven was also at the opposite end and adds to the charm of the place. Alfredo took care of us and he was wonderful. There were at least 3 Italian gentlemen (one could even be the owner) who also warmly welcomed us and greeted us a Happy Anniversary as well. It's honestly the people who will make you want to come back and that's the vibe that we got. We ordered a bottle of champagne and they had a fantastic 25% off bottle promo. Bottle service was so good as well. We normally aren't big pizza people but we were tempted so we gave in to their Quattro Formaggi pizza for starters, so delicious! Will come back just for this but we were also eyeing the Diavola for next time. Hubby ordered the Penne Rosate with grilled chicken and it was so good. The vodka sauce was well-balanced and the chicken perfectly seasoned and grilled! As for me, I had the specialty for the day, frutti di mare with spaghetti. Unfortunately this was a little bland for me and could have been better. The seafood was just mostly squid. I love squid but this was just a little too much and it also needed a bit more salt. Either way, I'm happy to not knock off a star because I appreciate the overall experience and quality of service. While we were already full, Alfredo handed us the dessert menu and I mean how could you not? The Chocolate Lava Cake with vanilla gelato was highly recommended and when they served it, they added a little candle and made it prettier, greeting us a Happy Anniversary again. Such a lovely touch! Turned out to be an excellent decision. That lava cake and gelato combo was so good I can't wait to have it again. Oh and Alfredo also gave us some delicious port wine upon paying. Italian hospitality at best. These guys surely know how to take care of their customers. Grazie mille, Team Ortomare! Look forward to coming back again soon!.Friendliest staff on UWS, just so welcoming, and caring for each and everycustomer at a personal level, inquiring about if they needed anythingmore, engaging and going extra length to explain the food, the specials.You will definitely feel very welcome here.The Ravioli is buttery, creamy, and tempered with Sage will melt in yourmouth. The Gnocchi Pasta, is buttery in rich tomato sauce, and temperedwith basil. The Pasta Funghi is very umami, the creamy sauce, the spinach,mushrooms and olive oil, with fresh black pepper definitely will make youtry it again. The Pizza dough is fresh, and reminds you of fresh hot flourfrom the mill, the pizzas are very balance, perfect crust and just rightcrisp. Flavors, portions, and cooking is very balanced, you will leavethis place happy.Ambiance is nice both indoor and outdoor seating on a bit too busyintersection.Definitely could expand on their wine collections, or carry some specialones, may be even offer amarone by the glass ;).Friendliest staff on UWS, just so welcoming, and caring for each and every customer at a personal level, inquiring about if they needed anything more, engaging and going extra length to explain the food, the specials.

My friend and I kept our coats on because it was 23 degrees out, but we were definitely sheltered from the wind. The tents are 100% enclosed (walls too), which would normally make me hesitate, but we were the only ones eating that night (again: 23 degrees!) so we didn't need to worry about being near other people. Food was delicious. My favorite dishes were the ravioli and diavolo pizza, though the calimari fritti was also great. Tiramisu for dessert was good if nothing too special. The guy who served us was super friendly. I'd definitely return!.The service was great, but the food was very basic. Not bad, but not worth what they're charging. The gnocchi and pizza were decent, however the carbonara was disappointing. Honestly, I can make better carbonara than what was served - need to pay $21 for it.If you're looking for authentic Italian food with spectacular service, then you need to come here. We started our meal with some meatballs in tomato sauce, followed by the diavola pizza and linguine with clams and garlic. Everything was perfect. The pizza had a perfect char on the crust, the pasta was al dente and very flavorful, and the meatballs felt so homey and delicious. The service is spectacular, they really take care of you and make your entire experience enjoyable from beginning to end."
"I have been here a few times and loved it each time. Pizza is delicious!   Appetizers and pasta dishes are yummy.  Very reasonably priced.  Good attentive staff. Update:  I stopped by for lunch to have pizza.  I don't know what happened - maybe it was a bad day, but the pizza was not good.  Dough was soggy, cheese not melted and overall it had very little taste.  I used to love their pizza. I'm not sure what happened.  I guess I'll give it another try.   When it was good, it was very good..I have been here a few times and loved it each time. Pizza is delicious!   Appetizers and pasta dishes are yummy.  Very reasonably priced.  Good attentive staff..This place is relatively new so for the time being I think your best bet is to dine in OR pick up your order so you can ensure it is to your satisfaction. I sat at the bar, as is my usual solo dining custom. Ordered a margherita pie and some glasses of prosseco.  Most wine will run you from $9-$12 unless you join the happy hour specials from 4-7pm. During happy hour everything house/well ranges from $5-$8. Not shabby. Pizza was ok. I like the wood burning oven as it adds a nice touch but would need to return to gauge if it is consistent.  Neighboring patrons seemed to be enjoying mostly pasta dishes so I would want to give those a try too. Sitting at the bar also allows you to order separate specials that are only available at the bar. Nice addition but want to return to be sure--- especially with MBV opening down the street now..Can't speak to dining in. I had the Salame pizza for pickup -- the taste was mediocre, and I was not blown away by the size or price.Note that they have two Menu links on their website, and the prices AND the food descriptions are different on each: Menu tab and the ""click to order here"" menu. Since I was picking up, I only looked at the Menu tab on their site. A bit misleading...I was expecting Salame pizza with mozzarella, tomato sauce, salami, and fresh basil for $13. I got instead Salame pizza with mozzarella, tomato sauce, and soppressata - basically a pepperoni pizza - for $15.50 (??!!!).This is a personal size pizza. For $16.33 including tax..Delicious Italian brick oven pizza! Danny, the manager, gave me what was probably the most enticing specials spiel I've ever heard. He put Michelin star waiters to shame with his flawless and enticing delivery of the chef's daily creations (which sounded AMAZING).We had two pizzas and checked in for the free wine. Surprisingly good house wine actually. The pizzas were just the right amount of sauciness and perfectly fired dough. The olives were excellent -- you could taste the quality. Same with the Italian sausage. Delizioso!.This place is still SO delicious, I want to try everything on their menu! I got the ravioli last night and it was delicious...just know that when they say butter, they mean the raviolis are literally smothered in butter. I love butter but would've enjoyed a tad less. Still love this place and would totally recommend to a friend..We pass by here all the time and decided to try it the other day! It was not a mistake! The pizza was delicious and so was the lasagna. The staff is from a bunch of different places so it was cool talking to them about where they're from. They have a deal to check in and get a free glass of wine which was also a fun incentive! I would definitely recommended this place for a fun date night or a dinner with friends.I ordered out but oh my god this pizza was so delicious. Fresh, not greasy, not nauseatingly cheesy. It was absolute perfection. The crust was perfectly thin and crispy. Can't imagine how good it would be if I actually went in to eat..Was with my boo and mom looking for somewhere to eat and we stumbled upon this lovely place with outdoor seating. The place has a nice space and nice Italian restaurant feel. We ordered a margaherita pizza and calamari to share and the taste was medicore. I was expecting more flavors of basil and oregano with an authentic taste. I think I was fooled the decor and setup of the restaurant. Unfortunately, I will not be eating here, but I can see how people who live in the area could make this spot a local spot to eat..Idk if it was just an off day but my steak salad came with warm soggy sautéed arugula .. never heard of the greens in salad being cooked before without that being explained on the menu.. had no flavor whatsoever - best part about the meal was the free bread.Maybe I came to this place on an off night, but I feel like I have entered an alternative universe when I read the other reviews for this place on Yelp.I went to Isola on a Saturday night at 8:30pm and the place was 60% empty -- usually a warning sign. I shared the calamari and two pizzas. All three dishes were pretty terrible: The calamari was rubbery, flavorless, and a bit slimy. The two pizzas were limp, poorly seasoned, and accompanied with what tasted like canned toppings. The one bright side was the service, which was very attentive and lovely, which made me reluctant to write this review. Maybe that's why there are so few other critical reviews of Isola?  Just a theory..I have only had pizza from here, and only had it delivered. But from those experiences, the pizzas have always been tasty."
"With the standard menu, the distinguishing feature of this Dunkin' Donuts is that it's a city location, so it's a tight space.  There's standing room only downstairs, but seating upstairs.  I tried the cold brew coffee, which tasted fine - exactly as it does at other Dunkin' Donuts. Would I go back?  Sure, if I needed something quick on the way to Penn Station again, and I hadn't planned ahead.FYI, the restroom was out of order on a Sunday morning..DD is dime a dozen on the east coast but from someone from CA, it is exotic! I used to live next to one when I was going to school in the East Coast and have fond memories of breakfast here.Was nice to see this location all done up with Halloween decorations. The donuts are ... just OK..I mean its Dunkin' Right? What could you say about this place that hasn't already been said or heard before right?Well, I stopped by this location in the middle of the night for a coffee fix and asked for my drink ""Light and Sweet"" which is how I usually order my coffee and they didn't get it right. Whenever I stop at any Dunkin' and they're unable to make my coffee fix sweet enough I don't feel like returning. Seems simple enough I would think.Their fast food donuts are decent though..This place is disgusting. The dust is 1/4 inch thick on the speakers. The windows are covered in dust. The floor is slippery from grease or oil.  We only popped in because it started to rain..Disappointed with the Ghost pepper flavor. I expected to make me drool, my head explode, nose bleeding, mouth burnt to a crisp, contemplate with what the hell I'm doing with my life etc... but nope. It came and went. I hope someone creates a Takis donut. That'll do the trick. Anywho, the location is great..24 hours! You can't beat that specially at 1:43am in the morning here in NYC.After midnight you can only order through the small glass door. They also turn the lights off so it seems closed. I tried the chocolate glazed and the strawberry glazed donuts. The donuts were ok but I mean it is 2am so they've been sitting there for a bit. I do still give it 3 stars because it wasn't hard or stale. The guy that helped me was very polite and courteous. This place was the second place I went to eat at NYC. This location was next to the hotel so it was a convenient. There's a 7-11 nearby and also 2 brothers pizza for that classic thin crust pizza..We have been here several times and the sitting area is never clean.  Ever.The server is very rude, ordering people around and not listening to those people trying to give their order (we tried three times).A convenient location but the experience is not worth the Convenience..The staff is rude, the place is absolutely filthy and I am pretty sure that lady in the corner is giving a handjob. Avoid at all costs..The worst service I've ever received in my life. Employees were incredibly rude and uninterested in the customers along with completely ignoring me. And to add to it all, the employee opened the door while I was in there after I repeatedly said the bathroom was occupied. I felt disrespected and I'm unsatisfied with the service. I normally love Dunkin Donuts but this was unacceptable..We tried this places TWICE before we even wrote a review. The first time we came here it was really late night and on our way to our hotel. You come to New York and you gotta have Dunkin Donuts and this location was open 24hrs. It was past midnight when we came to this location so the store front was closed, but the side window was open and you can still order donuts. We got the chocolate frosted and strawberry frosted. We were not impressed. The donuts were stale. We gave this place the benefit of the doubt and tried it again. We figured the first time was a fluke due to the time. Nope. Fail on the second time too.If you enjoy stale donuts come here!"
Go at least two times and you'll be rewarded with a free onigiri. Hence the reason I gave two stars. Zero is not possible and they deserved an extra star for giving away free food. I only drop in for udon close to pay day and not in the mood for a hot dog.
"First time this week grabbing a box of pre-made crunchy California rolls and crunchy Shrimp tempura rolls - they were actually good! A couple of things are that they don't have eel sauce ( the teriyaki sauce was a good substitute nonetheless) and on the pricey side - spent a little over $20 for lunch. Definitely not an every day lunch option! I will come back to try their Bento box or teriyaki chicken/salmon bowl..Second time here still really liking it I'll post a couple more pictures. Still the same spotlessly clean, completely fresh and appetizingly presented. The sushi here is premade but it's the best premade sushi you're going to buy. They make it constantly. It's absolutely better than the stuff I find at Whole Foods which I also find tasty..Absolutely fantastic! Perfectly fresh and completely convenient. To me is very unconventional for an entire restaurant be dedicated to buying premade sushi and then eating it on site, I figured it would be low quality and taste that way.  However the moment I walked in the door and took a look I could tell that it was better than I would have expected.One can easily tell the food was prepared with as much pride and carefulness as one would hope for. The employees definitely seemed to care about their work and we're busy making sure the food was prepared perfectly and that the restaurant was very clean. Good work Bento I will be back anytime I'm in the area!.I found this place because it's a commuter pit stop. I had the spicy tuna and thought it was alright. Just across the street from the Express Bus Stop..Ok so I've eaten here a few times & I have not had any issues. The one notorious problem is the lack of space. This location is packed (next to Century 21) & on Broadway which is jammed with tourists. I ordered the spicy California roll with Miso Soup & it was really good & around $10. The miso soup was pour out oF some water cooler looking device but tasty so I didn't mind too much. I would recommend this place for sushi but be prepared for the crowds bc it's always packed..Very small but very tasty little sushi bar in downtown New York. Reasonable prices for good size portions. Both broths were very flavorful. Only down side was the limited seating.The people who are working here wear their masks under their nose or half off, which means their droplets are going into the food..Came here for a quick meal, I ordered 3 poke bowl ( though it will be freshly made but it was not) waited more then 15mins for the sever to pick up the pre-made poke bowls from the refrigerator. Additionally when ordering and during our meal the staff were none stop fighting the entire time. As for the food itself, it was a scam. Tiny portions for the price, mediocre taste and worst of all as stated earlier the poke bowls weren't even fresh. Overall very unsatisfactory and a waste of time and money. Stay away from this place..Had the chicken teriyaki bento box with 2 pieces of salmon sushi. This meal consisted of chicken with teriyaki sauce, a vegetable dumpling, 2 pieces of salmon sushi and a small salad. The rice for the sushi was extremely hard and tasted and like regular jasmine rice.Overall, I was pretty unsatisfied with my experience here. The chicken they serve here isn't fresh and is pulled out of dirty hot water once it is ordered. Heck, upon walking in the store, there was an old boiling meat aroma. The tables at the restaurants (both locations) were extremely oily and dirty. The only reason why people return here is because they work in the area and want a quick and ""inexpensive"" lunch. Would not recommend..Joel Robuchon proclaimed--and not in a good way--""Sushi is taking over the world. It's like pizza. You can get it everywhere."" I agree with him--but I'm happy about it. And I'll be happier when we can say the same thing about ramen. So imagine my delight when I jammed into the bustling Bento Sushi and Noodles near the Freedom Tower close to Wall Street right before closing. I was having a ramen emergency. I really wanted some. But I was in a New York City food desert and there wasn't a lot open on a weekend evening downtown. Wall Street has a gazillion high quality fast food places but they are mostly for the lunch crowd. I lucked out.The miso ramen was very good. Yes, it came in a paper container like the kind they use in self-service yogurt shops. Yes, you sit on stools. Yes, the staff was speaking Hindi and not Japanese. But the noodles were cooked right in front of me, the miso broth was flavorful and the added ingredients were fresh and interesting. The noodles had the ""Q"" they talk about in Taiwan...a spongy al dente bite. Delicious. I also had the salmon sushi (sake). Very fresh and tasty. It was also on super sale, so I wasn't complaining. See you there, Joel!.I stop in here to diversify my lunch palate on workdays. Sushi is growing on me more and more and I eat here at least once a week and I always get the same spicy crunch roll with crab. It's tasty. It's $10. It's the Financial District. Deal with it. There are cheaper options that go as low as about $6.25 per roll.   The portion sizes are just enough for one person.  This place is also a good spot to sit and people watch from large windows on this busy corner but it can get extremely annoyingly crowded. Don't expect the tourists to leave you any seats on busy days or at lunch time. Nevertheless it's quick and easy to get in and out minus the whole squeezing your way through the sometimes hoards of indecisive travelers.Stop in for your freshly packaged quick sushi fix..I stop in here to diversifying my lunch palette on workdays.

"I love this place . We just ordered lunch from here and the ladies are so sweet . They take their job so seriously . The food was fresh too!.Hot, fresh and tasty, staff is friendly and efficient, great for a Togo meal too especially during this pandemic the staff has been doing their best.I will start by saying I usually never give fast food locations more than 3 stars. I was pleasantly surprised by this location. The location isn't horrible but allows for lots of parking. To be honest, I expected it to not be so clean, but it was quite clean and quiet, which I loved! We were immediately greeted once we walked up to the counter. It was our first time to a Boston market in over 10 years so we were a little confused at first but the young worker there was amazing and told us of all our options and even made sure we received the fresh food just coming out! This customer service is what made me give them the 5 star rating! I definitely hope they keep this up!The food was also delicious. Unfortunately I was so hungry I ate it before I could take picture but it was made perfectly! We will definitely be returning back to this location!.Was served undercooked hard potatoes. Guess what? It's raw and inedible, and that constitutes of a whole side. These people are delirious. How do you mess up on cooking POTATOES????? Also, there was no cornbread, when the menu promises you that cornbread is to be served with every meal. No cornbread? Then take a dollar off, since it promises you CORNBREAD not a dinner roll not a soda not a juice, BUT a CORNBREAD. We were given a dinner roll, which is hilarious..I love Boston market, but this place needs a heavy duty cleaning, and renovation,! I barely ever eat here, I get my food and go. The workers are very nice, and work fast, I never see them not working & hanging around. I always order the meatloaf, macaroni & cheese, and mash potatoes, all with extra gravy. Food has always tastes fresh, and will continue to get dinner from here..Very centrally located with tons of parking, the food wasn't as accommodating. I got the prime rib which was a mistake and my wife got the chicken which was on the smaller side, otherwise the sides were fair..Came here on a Sunday, so the store was basically empty. The staff was really friendly and nice and VERY generous with their scoops, unlike a certain Americanized Chinese takeout franchise. Cough panda express cough.We got the 2 for $20 deal which includes a plate with 2 sides, a drink, and a dessert, either a chocolate chip cookie or a brownie. I chose the brownie and my brother got the cookie. The cookie was rock hard, but the brownie was chewy and had bits of chocolate chips in them, so they were really good. Also the chicken here was more tender and less peppery compared to the ones at the Fresh Meadows location and they have unlimited refills here. And they have tea!!!.Came here on a Sunday, so the store was basically empty.

I tried ordering a cod because it's lent for me and there was no option so I selected turkey and was willing to pay the extra but due to inventory my order had to be cancelled and there was nothing they could do. They should really reevaluate that. It's a big inconvenience..I came at the perfect time! 2 meals for 20$! Comes with 2 entrees, 2 drinks, and 2 desserts!! I ordered it to go.I ordered 2 entrees of the 3 piece dark chicken. the chicken was really oily. For the sides I got Mac n cheese, stuffing, mashed potatoes, and corn. All the sides were on point! For the dessert I picked the apple pie and chocolate brownie. Def taste better after putting it in the microwave for 10 seconds!As I always say it's like thanksgiving everyday at Boston market. Yum!.disgusting. place is dirty. lady cleaning was spraying lysol and wiping table in aisle next to me. i smelled spray. fraud and deception with pricing. on large sign on wall it says meal is $8.99 i had buy one get one free meal coupon. in small thing on glass low down it says .25 for premium sides but it is not on main sign on wall. she charged me .25 for free item meal. and .50 additional.on purpose the additional fraud price charges not visible and it is sneaked on the receipt. sides normally ordered now premium??? so i paid $13.50 for buy one gt one. plus she charged for xlarge drink. do not eat int his dirty place of fraud.   will never eat there there is no deal."
"I booked the venue for a holiday party for my staff. The ease of booking was one of the many things I loved about this spot. The owner Al was extremely helpful and pleasant. The ambiance was perfect, the food was great and the DJ (Ty) placated all the right music.My staff loved the party so much! I would recommend this for any party rental.This is review is based on my first time visiting this place last night. I met a group of friends here for an event. The space is nice, however it is small. Drinks: very weak. I advise you to just drink straight liquor aka henny or whatever you like. Do not get mixed drinks. I had a rum punch which was literally juice.Bartenders: There were two that night. One had an attitude. This is also the one who over charged my card.Ambience: nicely lit, mixed crowdDJ: the dj was pretty good played a variation of afrobeats, soca, reggae and hip/hopPricing: I purchased 5 henny shots which was $50, hookah which was $30, and rum punch which was $9. However, I was charged $132. I work in finance so I don't understand how they got to this price. As you can see I was overcharged. If I give you my card, I don't expect you to just put whatever on it. This is the main reason I am giving this establishment 1 star.If you decide to go, pay cash..I celebrated my 40th birthday at Social Butterfly. The owner and staff made it a spectacular event. My friends and family are still talking about it! We all loved the drinks, loved the food and loved the music!I chose SB because I'm originally from the neighborhood and I attended a party their seven years ago and had a lot fun.I met with manager to lock in date end of March for my July event. Everything discussed was documented and sent by the owner to ensure we were both on the same page. I rented space for early evening to kick the party off privately with family and friends. The early open fee was reasonable. It was agreed and understood that promoter would host another event starting at 11 PM which would merge the two event. The staff did a phenomenal job with the flow of the two events. I had my own dj for my event and SB brought in theirs-I don't recall the music stopping. The dee jays were flawless with their transition.The bar staff was kind and quick. The real talk about my party was the food. SB chef, Sparkle did the damn thing! I ordered tray of BBQ wings, Rasta pasta, chicken fingers, sweet potato fries  and salad. All food was really good. The Rasta pasta was the talk of party and had my friends questioning who did the catering. Sparkle-that's who!Social Butterfly exceeded my expectations. Planning a milestone could come with stress and having it there removed a lot steps and stress for me. Thank you to their team for making my night so special..This place sucks. The music is terrible, drinks are watered down....Super fun atmosphere danced the night away. Decent drinks, they are not shy with the alcohol. Would visit again.So, my review was removed by yelp because it was brought to their attention by the ""yelp community"", that it wasn't enough information.  I'll make sure to be thorough this time.My friend and I went on a Saturday I believe, not a far drive from Flatbush. The sign is nice, we'll lit very pretty. The bouncer was nice, checked our id's we went in. I had tickets but, couldn't find them and the man was nice enough to stamp us in. Walked past the the bar towards the back, guess there was a birthday party going on. We were pretty early so there wasn't a crowd yet. The dj was ok, played some good songs.My friend and I proceeded to the bar; she ordered a long Island which was made in a tall glass, when I asked the bartender why it wasn't made in a 32oz cup like everywhere else she replied,  ""usually it's made in the tiny plastic cup but, I'm being nice tonight so I made it in a tall glass."" Well, thank you for your kindness. Cash only bar they don't take credit nor debit. The decor could use some work, the booths need to be replaced; the inside should look as nice as the sign. It's a tiny place, a lot of young folks. Around 2 I think it started getting crowded, nice mature looking folks, the music was good, I enjoyed myself. And I left.  Upon leaving out the door a lady approached the bouncer and told him not let us back in, I'm not sure why but, I couldn't care less because I won't be returning. This place is very popular, and it has potential..Had a party here for a Family member. Party was amazing Albert (Owner) delivered everything that was promised and then some. He was very gracious and accommodating. His son was very helpful as well. The music was amazing, the food was delicious, the Bottle service was right on time, the location is prime.. I love this place. The atmosphere was incredible. I was truly impressed. I will definitely have another event at the amazing Social Butterfly..Wow it was a great time good music  but being that it is such a small venue it is better off as a family affair rather than complete strangers.....its is off the way of Washington Avenue so if you dont make the right turn you will miss it but it was good half off prices on the food chicken and fries very freshly made hot and the drinks was good. I had Patron from the bottle so you can't go wrong. It had great old school and new school music but I missed out on my free shot....I will go back again. They do need more exits and more bartendersThanks for the reply I guess I was just trying to say more visible exits but I will come by sometime since it was a great family party that night....thanks  for keeping us highly entertained.So I arrived after happy hour and missed their $5 rum punch drink! I wasn't a fan of the martini, but the owner, Albert personally spoke with me about my review and worked to resolve any concerns, which is absolutely appreciated. He gave me a new drink, and the night was merry. Pros: live performances, clean restroom, takes credit card, intimate venue, strong drinks, Yelp promotion for checking inCons: may be too small for very large parties, on-site ATM went out of order as a friend pulled cash (not on the venue, but the ATM company)Overall, a chill place to see up and coming talents with easily accessible management..Its very convenient located on Atlantic Avenue, I had the opportunity to go in after the Nas/Maxwell concert on Valentine's Day. It had been a long COLD day but I stayed in a loft across the street from this place and wasn't finished dancing. Saw social butterfly and said hey ""sounds like me"" and zipped across to their front door. Now this isn't the prettiest place or even the most up to date. You can tell from the patrons this is a local spot and has regulars. HOWEVER, those are my favorite places. I had wings while there that were PHENOMENAL - Drinks - Strong yet smooth and the staff were really attentive. I really appreciated that especially. The music was really good, but I like old R&B which is exactly what was playing and suited me fine. I would definitely visit again."
"Lovely place! The hostess kennedy was soooo lovely!!! Had a whole conversation with her and she seemed to enjoy her job!! Love to see that from young kids these days. Will come again.We had dinner at Max's Es-Ca while visiting our friends in Staten Island. We ate in the outdoor tent area that was well heated and spacious, tables weren't on top of another. One of the appetizer specials were stuffed zucchini flowers that were well worth the price. A generous portion of four that were stuffed with ricotta cheese and topped with a creamy sauce, they melted in your mouth.I love Bronzino and always hesitant ordering this delicious fish when not in Southern Europe because in the USA I've has some awful versions. Typically, a good waiter will suggest something else if a particular dish is one of the weakest but Brianna was so confident based on customer feedback, I ordered it. WOWZA! The Bronzino was the best I've ever had! I was served a large portion from the meatiest part of the fish and it was perfectly cooked, flaky, so it retained its sweetness. Topped with olive oil and a medley of Mediterranean staples; capers, tomatoes, onions, olives and lemon. The base was a flawlessly cooked risotto and sauteed spinach.There was a snag, we were seated at 7:30PM and didn't get served our main course until after 10:15PM. It was explained that the small cooking staff was taxed however to soften the wait, we were offered a round of drinks and dessert on the house. Does a free wine and tiramisu wipe away the long wait? This time it did! My meal will always be remember as having the best of one of my favorites! look forward visiting my friends in Staten Island again soon, I know where I will be making reservations! Bravo Max's Es-Ca!.Veal chop Milanese did not have any MILANESE! As well the veal chop -  without Milanese- was FLAT no flavor. Sent it back. Ordered a steak. Who ruins a steak?' OMG! The place is filled with staten Eyeland women ... all the same straightened jett black dyed hair, make up, clothing. Everyone was a twin... ewwww yuk! This was my second time and last time here! I loveMy friend but he is losing his upper taste since retirement.Was in the area and went to check it out.  If you don't know the owner or workers they relegate you to the tent which can be an ice box if you don't speak up. They did turn heat on but still felt like eating in a garage.  Food was passable but severely overpriced. Four people over 250 bucks with one drink.  Will not go back but it wasn't terrible.  There are better more reasonable places nearby. The prices just don't equal the quality or atmosphere..What is all the hype? Well this place is not what's up! I went for lunch with my family. The atmosphere is ok and just ok. The most important thing to me was the food! I ordered the pork chops which were seriously lathered in balsamic vinegar. (Disgusting) We also ordered the beef Wellington and the OVERPRICED jumbo shrimps (you get 4) and the SUPER OVER PRICED spring rolls! Let me say that EVERYTHING is overpriced for no good reason. I mean there are tons of places that you can eat at so why choose this one? Maybe its the name which is quite cool at best. But honestly, I cant recommend this place to any of my family or friends. Now some people just get hooked on these new eateries that appear to be trendy. And over time the word of mouth hype morphs into something that seems to be positive but in reality is not. I believe that this is one of those restaurants. Save yourself some money and visit one of the many other fine establishments on Staten Island. And if you can't find a good place to eat,  go into Brooklyn or New York City which will be worth the trip for some seriously great food. Don't fall for the hype on this one..I had high expectations for the food but it honestly isn't anything special nor worth the money imo. The desserts however were *great*- we got the blueberry banana bread, the flourless chocolate cake w ice cream & the beignets! Our waitress was very attentive and sweet, and we didn't have to wait long at all for our food. It was an overall pleasant experience, just wish the food was better!.We had a fabulous lobster dinner here on Tuesday night (special lobster menu every Tuesday). We ordered the Angry Lobster (2 lbs lobster with a simple scampi sauce and red pepper flakes), lobster risotto, lobster Pappardelle (freshly made pasta). The lobster was fresh, sweet, and very succulent. The sauces were flavorful. The stand out star was actually the homemade pappardelle. It was SO GOOD-Perfectly chewy, and soaked up the creamy brandy sauce and lobster very nicely.  We had beignets for dessert and every bite was delightful. The beignets comes as 4 pieces, filled with jelly and three different sauces-caramel, creme brûlée, and chocolate. It's perfect for sharing to finish off a delicious dinner. The dinner entree portions are really big, so there's really not a lot of room left for dessert...but the beignets are just too good to pass up..This review is simply about the experience due to Covid and my personal and honest opinion.I had dinner here a few nights ago and we were a group of 8. The food was amazing as always, our server was amazing and on it the whole time and the place is just a great restaurant for great food and a nice environment overall. Unfortunately I don't think it is doing the best it could do to keep its patrons safe right now. I mean the restaurant was CROWDED. Every table was just about full and there was maybe 1 divider I saw in the entire restaurant and it was between my table and another's... other then that it was a free for all....They had a 40th Birthday party going on with who knows... maybe 20People? Then next to that was the table next to me which had approx a party of 10 directly behind us.The waiters all wore masks and they took our temperature at the door and also asked for our homeAddress and phone number I guess to trace If someone from that evening tests positive.I ate there in the Summer a few times and that experience was not an issue. I get being closed for so long you want to get back into it and be able to continue feeding your family and the families of your employees and I'm all for it... just if you read this pleasetry to adhere to the 50% capacity law for now.I know it was not just me feeling this was since others ar my table commented the same thing.The next night I went to Fushimi on Page Ave. it was eye opening to see how much more they took Covid restrictions serious. They had this fancy body thermometer you walk up to too get your temp taken before entering, this restaurant and I may be wrong but I think it's larger dining wise and there was people but it felt so quiet since we were allSo spaced apart.On top of it they had screens between each 2 topOr 4 top table which I thought was really nice to see and it just felt like the complete opposite of what I experienced the night before. I didn't have any anxiety about being in that environment.At the end of the day though if you want a consistent delicious meal whenever going out. This is definitely one of Staten Islands better/best options in the food category..We were seated in there garden patio which is really nice. There drink list has no cocktails so I asked what they had. He said we have a full bar we can make you anything. I asked for a specific drink and he says he doesn't know what that is. Name the ingredients and they don't have the ingredients to make it. So I asked for something fruity which he delivered it was a bay breeze. That was good. My friend got a screw driver and it was awful. He took our entree orders and he never came back to our table. I had to flag him down for another drink. The food took a long time to come out. Mine was cold. We finished our food and waited for him to come back. My sister got so frustrated with him not coming back that she went inside to ask for the check. We paid cash so we could get the hell out of there. The food was alright and the service was bad. Won't be coming back..They're open during weekdays. Everyone should eat here. Hopefully, they'll get draft beer soon."
"Loaded Tots = delicious French Onion Soup = amazing Beer selection = something for everyone Table service = friendly and attentive A+We will be back again :).Food and service were great, we went after my wife had ordered a Cuban Sandwich on Seamless. I didn't actually see the bill, so I didn't see if there was an extortionate ""credit card charge"" - most businesses would just include that in their pricing as it's part of the cost of doing business and no one would be the wiser, but making it clear as day on a bill is a bit shady in my view.That said, we did really enjoy the food, the service was good, and I'd go back..Ugh.  Don't mess with a hangry grub hubber.  Since my order was *canceled* I can't post there.Simple order, to be tracked on Grubhub. Tracker says the delivery guy has been sitting there for 45 minutes. Called the restaurant - whoever answered the phone said their app is down and they have no clue. They don't see my order, no one's come in to ask. I get that it's a challenge but, come on! If you're taking orders, you should know your app is down. Only posting a star because no stars isn't a option..Been coming to this place for years. Recently Steve the bartender went above and beyond with his knowledge of cocktails and the wide assortment of beers they have their..Stopped by here by chance and decided to give it a try. It's a big place with plenty of outdoor seating for dine in or just for a few drinks with your friends. It's really nice on a nice breezy summer day. We ordered the bison burger and fish and chips. I didn't expect much from this place after looking at the mixed reviews but I'm surprised that the food is actually pretty decent. I didn't ordered beer but they do have a wide selection of draft beers ranging different types from ipa to stouts. It's a really casual and down to earth place to come chill for brunch or for dinner..Nice casual beer bar with delicious food. The tater tots were fantastic. I came to watch an NBA playoff game and it wasn't crowded at all, there were other sports being played on the TV as well so there's something for everyone. Bartender was kind and attentive. This is your regular neighborhood watering hole. Nothing crazy about it. Come and watch sports and relax.First of all nicest person ! Best bartender with great knowledge of recipes ! Keep enjoying your work ! you are the best!. #Eamonn.Came here with a few friends after hitting the gym to get drinks and some food. This place has substantial outdoor seating and looks like it's bigger than what they had available with their indoor capacity. We sat in their makeshift wooden seating area, which they had an electric heater next to the table.A few of the food we shared included the Ale House Quesadilla ($12.95), Buffalo Wings ($13.95), and Classic 12-Inch Pizza ($12.95). They are your standard bar food and they met expectations in terms of quality.The place houses a very decent draft menu. I got All the Way Up: Cherries & Blackberries, pretty good sour beer. This went for $12. Most of the selections ranges between $8 and $12. This seems to be the main appeal while also being able to watch whatever sporting event is going on.The absolute turn off was at the end when we got the bill. On top of the 10% COVID fee (I personally didn't mind this to support local businesses), they also charged a credit card fee. Business is business, but there are plenty of other restaurants out there also dying for business as well that don't charge these fees and are surviving just fine!.We had the pleasure of sitting out front next to the host Alejandro! He was such great company and conversation! Stephanie our server was also fantastic! The drinks are on point and the area is also amazing! you can guarantee we'll be back!!! - Liz & Jeroen.I honestly don't know how this place survives.  Mediocre overpriced food, overpriced, erratic service.  No popcorn should cost $9.  The bartender on an ""ale house"" should know what the beers are that are on tap.  This is the pub epitome of Upper West Side mediocrity."
"This is a must try if you are in NYC. They are said to have one of the best pizzas in Little Italy or in NYC. We came here and asked the server what she recommended and we were told all the pizzas here are all good. We got the Rustic Double Pepperoni. It is really a pepperoni pizza but it tasted very different from other pizzas I have ever had back home. All the ingredients were fresh. They serve it on a thin crust. The mozzarella that they used is very different from what I am used to. I am assuming they made it in house and no preservatives. When we went, the inside was pretty much a full house and note that we didn't come during the prime time. We showed up at 2 pm. This place is cash only. They do have an ATM inside the restaurant. Overall, I really enjoyed the pizza and I highly recommend coming here. Note that this is in NYC, so $28 Usd for a pizza is pretty much the norm. The pizza isn't huge. I think i can eat 3/4 a pizza on my own.Service was good. I highly recommend coming here. I also heard that this place is a landmark of Little Italy, NYC and the USA. They are the first Pizzeria in USA..It's always a must to eat pizza while in New York. It was our goal to try this restaurant during our NYC trip. They only take cash here, so make sure to take extra. We went during the week just in time for dinner and we were seated immediately. We already knew what we wanted to order, we we ordered the Original Margherita Pizza with Pepperoni. We also ordered their peach iced tea, which was so refreshing! We got our pizza in like 15 mins, and wow! It was so delicious! It had the perfect amount of cheese, and the pepperonis were crispy and fresh. Service was also great, our server was very attentive and made sure we were taken care of. The pricing wasn't bad there either. I'm glad our first pizza in New York was at this iconic place! Make sure to check them out..Great pizza and nice nostalgia to it! This place has been renovated but it's been there since 1905. The margarita pizza with spinach and mushrooms was amazing and so was the eggplant for appetizer. The breadsticks were disappointing, although fresh and crisp, there was no flavor to it. The cannolis were pure ricotta and I was disappointed in it. We had a 15 minute wait and you couldn't wait inside, so that was a bummer. Overall, would try another pizza next time but good and fresh food!.Lombardi's Pizza is top notch!!!!While on vacation in New York, we really just stumbled upon Lombardi's Pizza. We figured we should try the pizza in New York. Being Californians, we had heard and been told that trying out the pizza in NY is the thing to do! We immediately saw how crowded and popular Lombardi's Pizza was and took that as a good sign. If it is really busy, then it must be good right? Pretty strong deductive reasoning I think lol Anyway, we ordered two pizzas for us to share. One pizza had meat on it and the other one we ordered was the White Pizza. And wowwwww! That White Pizza was SO GOOD. Literally the best white pizza I've ever had. I still think about the amazing flavors and how tasty it was. The mix of mozzarella and ricotta cheese with Alfredo sauce. Oh man, delicious! Complete bliss. I'm not ashamed to admit that we went back several times for more of that white pizza lol I wish there was a flying Grubhub or Uber Eats service that would allow me to order some white pizzas from Lombardi's and fly them to California lol Then we could re-heat them and experience the awesomeness again. Sadly we can't lol so next time we go visit, this is a must on our itinerary..I was getting an itch.  A travel itch again and went back to New York City in November 2021 for a quick 3 day weekend trip.  I went with a friend, and it was his first time in New York City, so I wanted to show him the NYC basics.  So one of the meals we had was at Lombardi's Pizza.  Lombardi's is known as  ""America's First Pizzeria"" since 1905.  I had gone to Lombardi's previously when I used to live in NYC and remember the lines being really long.  To my surprise, the line was short (mostly because my friend and I were comfortable seating indoors).  A quick show of our COVID vaccination cards, and we were seated within 10 minutes.  We tried their Pizza (Original Margarita), Pasta (Rigatoni & Meatballs), & Wings (Buffalo).  We each had a couple of cocktails.  ENJOY!.I can now say I've visited the first pizzeria in the United States! Had a pleasant experience at Lombardi's, but the servings can be on the smaller side in my opinion. Especially when looking at the prices and expecting something a bit larger. Pizza is very light with lots of strong attributes to it. I also wish the pizzas had more sizes rather than being all 12"". Also fair warning this place is cash only, which can be inconvenient.We got the classic margherita pizza and and the ravioli. The pizza was a classic, super simple with tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. There was a nice crunch due to the crispy crust and it held together smoothly. However, like I mentioned, the pizza was fairly light so not too filling or heavy. This was also because the classic pizza used the minimal ingredients, offering small areas of tomato sauce on crust when not covered by mozzarella. I'm not sure if the other pizzas may be a little heavier, but I doubt it. Seems like simplicity is king here.Ravioli wasn't too surprising. Six pieces like it's written, neatly wrapped and light. Ricotta on the inside was delicious but in all honestly it felt like typical ravioli I can get anywhere. I did enjoy the presentation though..Service was good. They only take cash. Grandma's Meatballs we're really good! We also ordered their famous original margherita pizza. It was alright. Not as hearty or flavorful as the square pizzas you can get from other pizza places..Lombardi's is known as the first pizzeria in the United States. That alone should make it a place worth visiting. The problem is the pizza isn't that good; it's a thicker crust than most New York shops which is ambitious because the crust isn't even that good. Apart from the cool history, other redeeming qualities of this restaurant are the meatballs (super good), the Stromboli (also really good, the sauce has pepperonis in it), and the service (which is phenomenal). They are cash only..This may be an NYC institution but it falls short to today's standards. There's so much amazing pizza in this city and Lombardi's pies do not impress. Everything about the pie was mediocre, from the dry crust to the tomato sauce. And at $26 for a rather small pie, I would much rather grab a slice elsewhere.Also the server overcharged us by $2. Could definitely have been a mistake..I love Lombardi's for their flavor forward sauce, you can tell the care they put into crafting such a great homemade sauce. Definitely pay Lombardi's a visit - it's a part of history as well and the whole experience speaks to that. The restaurant ambiance is reminiscent of early New York and they've done a great job to preserve that.Of course do try the margarita pizza as it allows the freshness of their tomato sauce to shine. In addition to that they have an arugula and prosciutto pie which is delicious. I LOVE a good clam pie and this is a pretty decent option for that as well. I'd prefer it to be a little less dry to be honest but it's still very flavorful and delicious."
"The only decent sandwich shop for lunch in the area. Pleasant staff and service. Menu does not change to much. Reliable..One of my favorite lunch places. They have a long menu and you have a lot of options there. Their salads are pretty fresh, healthy with well balanced flavors..I love thanksgiving left overs and whenever I am close by a Lenwich I try to stop in to get the thanksgiving sandwich.  I always ask for extra cranberry sauce and extra gravy.  It is the best thanksgiving sandwich I have had..These sandwiches are really great. The first time I got it was through ritual and during the dollar dash deal, so I expected it to be really small considering I only paid $1 but it was the juiciest most filling sandwich I've ever had. It was the the Havana sandwich and came with a really great garlic aioli. Amazing. This time I got the Lenwich sandwich on focaccia bread and it was delicious. I try not to finish them because they're so big and filling but they honestly just taste that good. It's nice to have a sandwich that's not frugal with its meat/filling.Spacious and great to be in and out for lunch. Plus points for non plastic salad bowl..Wow, Lenwich was simply spectacular. The atmosphere is also amazing. Lenwich has a magnificent Buffalo Chicken, this dish will blow you away with its incredible taste and flavor. Nice staff, too. I'm giving 5 stars to Lenwich, only because I can not give 6 or 7..I've only had the sandwiches twice, but I would have to say that the first time I had it, it was a better pick of the sandwich. I had the Lenwich the first time and the TC the second. Both were ok, but there was more flavor in the Lenwich. The TC seems more healthy, but sadly I felt like I mainly tasted the coleslaw in it. I like that they do pack the sandwich so you do get quite a bit in it. Both times I got it with 7 grain whole wheat which is pretty good. The bread is quite soft, but I think it soaks up liquid too quick so it doesn't hold us as well. The time I got the TC, I ate it in store and yet the bread still felt like it was already getting soggy. Maybe I would have to try a different type of bread if I went back, but overall I think their sandwiches are pretty decent. I haven't tried anything else so I can't say how the other food is. Other than the food, service is pretty quick. When I first went there I didn't know that you ordered at specific areas and then paid at the cashier. They have sections for different food groups. I noticed that that if you order near closing, they do ask that you order at the cashier first though. I do wish that they opened later because 4PM feels quite early and there were many times when I wanted a sandwich but forget that they are closed and get disappointed. Other than that, I haven't really had a bad experience here..Giving this place 5 stars because the simple turkey sandwich was honest to G*d the best turkey sandwich I've had in the city! The people who worked there were very nice and quick too! The perfect lunch before heading to the Natural History Museum!.50% chance the person ringing you up will be a jerk--especially the ones that mumble and grumble at you.I don't need perky service, but please convince me you care at all. I've been here enough to say this is not a one time thing.Food quality is generally ok. They forgot cheese on my sandwich once..It's a Lenwich, more or less the same as all the other. Standard sandwiches, hot food, coffee, other stuff. My personal favorite sandwich is the Thanksgiving, but they're all good. And definitely filling - they don't skimp on the fillings.Knocking off a point because even at 1:30 pm after the lunch rush, it still took 15-20 minutes to get one sandwich. Didn't seem that busy in there to me.."
"The best ma la Tang at this area!The soup is so rich, we all know soup is the most important parts of ma la Yang, and this soup will not let you down.Next time I will ask them what is the soup made of. It's not too salty, so you can enjoy the soup while you eating the vegetables and meat. The vegetable, they have mushrooms, cabbage, Shanghai green vegetable, two kinds of tofu products, wood ear, noodle, Potato  Meats: Taiwan sausage and meatballs. I hope they have beef. You don't have choice about the meat.I love the bowl. A lot restaurant use those tall white plastic bowls or white wide thin plastic for noodle and I hate it. But the container they are using is higher quality. The food is hot but the bowl outside will not burn your hands  When you order take out, you can tell them to pick up at a specific time, and they will prepare the food food right before your arrive. Excellent service! The waiter and waitress are really nice..Small cozy interesting place. Their most famous/popular dish is the chicken pot if the store name isn't obvious enough lolMy significant other and I went for the small size pot, heavy sauce level and mild spicy level. We found it to be pretty spicy even though we can usually handle Sichuan food. We opt for heavy sauce because later on they will add soup stock so it will become diluted. We added 2-3 additional ingredients and it was sufficient for the two of us. Below are some of the positive and negative:(+)Free WiFiCan opt for hot tea instead of cold water (hot tea taste like tea! Wow ... but is sweet though)Let you customize your pot to what you prefer to eatVery Tasty!!Service was good10 percent cash discount with posting on wechat(-)Quite a bit of chicken bones (Perhaps they didn't wash after cutting?)I prefer bigger chunk of chicken. I think they cut it way too smallDefinitely will be back to try the other three types of pot.This is my favorite chicken hotpot in nyc. Their fried mushroom is also the best one I've ever had in USA. Our waiter is very friendly and helpful. Chicken is juicy and tasty. Veggie are very fresh..This is the best dry hotpot place in Flushing! I love their speciality chicken hot pot. It is definitely one of a kind. Their flavor reminds of my childhood food in northeastern (东北）China. I would definitely come back for more!.Really friendly services. Food is good and reasonable prices. Always give out discounts!.They Added way too much MSG this is what I felt after an hours. price isn't reasonable for what they given. Cashier wasn't patient enough to explain what it is . Very disappointed it ..Great portion and quality. I highly recommend this place for getting spicy food around Flushing..After the first time dining in the chicken hotpot, it became my favorite restaurant!!! Shrimp taste ok but Chicken tastes unbelievable amazing !!!.Delicious! My husband ordered a Chicken pot, and I ordered a Malatang ,both delicious!! Love it.Love to go this place with my friends. Love their foods. Just same taste as hometown.  Great place to have northern malatang cold noodle plus chicken hot pot.  Love it."
"They bake all the pan dulce (sweet bread) in house, and it has that perfect bakery smell even when you walk past it outside. Definitely stop in and try the bread. It goes so well with coffee and the family who owns Don Paco Lopez has been baking pan dulce and running a bakery for generations, so they definitely know what they're doing and are really interesting to talk to about bread, Mexican culture, and the history of Sunset Park itself.My favorites are the conchas with either a hot coffee or a champurrado, which is a hot chocolate with a little bit of corn atole. If you've never had sweet bread or are just overwhelmed by the choices, ask the staff or the other customers. Then again, it's kind of hard to go wrong..Me gusta mucho los tamales de aquí y el champurrado! Delicioso, pero sinceramente el servicio al cliente siempre es horrible, especialmente por el joven que está detrás del counter (area de tamales y tortas)  muy rudo, no tiene paciencia , pareciera como si estuviese enojado con la vida, el tiene mucho tiempo trabajando ahí, es lo qué pasa abecés con los empleados de mucho tiempo, opinó que simplemente con sonreír sería genial, si pagamos no necesitamos que nos ignoren , que nos griten o que nos hagan gestos  malos..Iva a comprar desde la 21 st por q m los recomendaron en especial el  champurrado y los tamales de dulce pero siempre equivocan las órdenes y la última vez estaba un hombre totalmente confundido y despota por lo q yo no vuelvo mas prefiero comprar en la calle en la 5 avenida sobra gente gustosa de venderte sus  tamalitos.I really wanted to love this place, especially because it has great energy and the staff is super friendly -- but I just didn't find it to be as good as other panaderias in the neighborhood. Both the tamales and baked goods were pretty dry and unremarkable. I know some people *swear* by their tamales, so I'll be giving them another try at some point, but have no been impressed so far..I went to get Pan Dulce and a large container of coffee for a funeral at this food establishment. I was treated with a lot of consideration and respect from the owner/management. She was so kind to my husband and I. She offered us a free tray, cups and napkins and even gloves for the small setup for our family during my granny's wake at De Riso Funeral Home nearby. My granny loved her Mexican Conchitas and so do I, though we are Salvadorians. I will never forget the kindness the owners and the attendants showed up and I would definitely be back because everyone enjoyed the baked goods and raved about the coffee.  thanks for making a difficult day easier. God Bless your business..I was eating my breakfast this morning when I found this hair in there salsa verde tamale. This is absolutely ridiculous and gross; I absolutely don't recommend buying here!.Lemme say this one time, YOU HAVE TO BE THERE EARLY TO GET TAMALES. They go FAST. And it's because they are one of the best around. Don't slack, wake up and go get them. I love that the owner is always around giving a hand and helping out too. Shows alot about the guy and establishment. I can't speak for every food item here but the Mexican Bread, coffee and Tamales are worth the trip. BRING CASH for a quick and easy transaction..The most amazing pan dulce out there, better than the ones I've had even while in Mexico.Love getting my morning ice coffee here and evening. Great tasting coffee, always goes great with a nice sweet bread. Huge selection of sweet bread always can switch it up. If you are having a hard time deciding ask someone for some help and they would gladly recommend something. This time I picked up a small sweet bread with coconut shavings on top with a small layer of vanilla cream filling inside, just the perfect amount. If you like vanilla cream try the churros they are great trust me. If you haven't gone next door to grab some tamales I suggest you do. My favorite are the salsa verde. . A small amount of green salsa with melted cheese inside which is amazing. They tend to get sold out so don't be disappointed if you are not able to get one. Just ask when the next batch will come out trust me so worth the wait..Apologies in advance, but I gotta do it:  Chili today, hot tamale.  Because the Tamales here are hot, as in 5 stars worth!  Moist and generously filled with either cheese, pork, or chicken, these Tamales should be on every NYC cheap eats best of list, if you ask me. Pick up a couple and you have a filling and soul-satisfying lunch for under $5. I confess I have not tried anything else on the menu because I cannot get past these.Pro Tip #1:  You may want to bone up on that high school Spanish to communicate more than the basics.  I STRUGGLED to convey that I wanted sides of hot red & green sauce (which I highly recommend) to go with my Tamales on a recent visit.  Finally, it turned out another employee knew English.  (Bless you!)Pro Tip #2:  If you're feeling confident about that Spanish, you may want to call ahead to make sure Tamales are available.  On one visit, we wound up waiting 40 minutes for them to make some.  On another, they only had the Chicken.& Jalapeno filled option.  Pro Tip #3:  Albert Einstein defined insanity as ""doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.""  I guess hubby and I must be certifiable since we have trekked over here more than once on a Sunday for Tamales, only to find it closed.  Do not make that same mistake.Pro Tip #4:  For Tamales, go to the teany restaurant attached to the main Panaderia aka Bakery."
"I've been here a couple times and both included a frozen a negroni and/or lemon cocktail! It's so refreshing for the summer and it's not too strong. The food here is also tasty...The buratta is basically a must-have! It's a huge portion on top of a mixed panzanella salad (grape tomatoes, onions, soaked croutons all dressed in a vinegar and oil).The octopus salad appetizer is also fairly decent, although it lacked a tiny bit of salt. It's unique that it includes purple potato and is a play on the purple octopus color. I enjoyed a really great burger- the ribeye cheeseburger. I had it cooked to medium and it was done just right. It comes with a side of tomato, spring greens, thick slices of onion and a pickle. What makes this burger is this amazing San Marzano jam. It is really amazing!! I would love to have a jar of this at home to put on my toast for breakfast! The service lacks a tiny bit, perhaps it was understaffed at the shift? It was lunch time on a Friday though...anyway great spot in Chelsea, located right next to the high line, close to chelsea market and chelsea pier..I think Alta Linea is somewhat misrepresented for two reasons:1) It is advertised as an ""Italian"" restaurant, likely because it's comes from a restaurant team that typically churns out quality Italian spots (but not Quality Italian--that's just me being purposefully confusing)2) It is a fully outdoor venue and near the High Line, yet not on the roof and thus without a view of the actual High Line.I share this because I had a much different experience here than I was expecting to have. I wouldn't judge that as being either good or bad--simply unexpected. Though our dinner here was nearly ruined by some very abrupt rain showers (not in the forecast, but that's New York in the summer for you), we managed to get here at just the right time and to secure a dry table. We had a lovely meal here, complete with frozen Negronis until last call.So as mentioned, Alta Linea is a fully outdoor venue. It's basically a massive terrace/garden/patio that sits in front of the High Line Hotel. Because they're fully outdoors, they monitor the forecast carefully. If the day is projecting a likelihood of rain that's above a certain percent, they'll close. So keep that in mind while making your reservation here. On the whole, though, Alta Linea being outside is far more of a pro than a con. The space itself is sprawling, beautiful and elegant. It's like a little wonderland--trees, dangling lights, grassy areas, etc. Though I came here with a girlfriend, I think this could be a fantastic date spot. Despite its size, it's got a romantic vibe to it. When Alta Linea first opened, I honestly thought it was a stand on the High Line that sold frozen Negronis. I just kept hearing ""High Line"" and ""[dangerous] frozen negronis"". So, like, can you blame me? Anyway, 30 minutes before we were due to arrive for our reservation, I received a text from Alta Linea (or Resy, technically?) that read: ""You're due at Alta Linea in 30 minutes. Protip: Beware the frozen negroni."" So clearly, this is a thing. Neither my friend nor I love negronis, but these are worth all of the hype. They might even deserve MORE hype. They are adult Icees. And perhaps just as dangerous to ingest. They are magical.Re: food. I wouldn't call myself an Italian food connoisseur but it's pretty clear that there's nothing notably Italian about this place. You will not find pizza or pasta. The only thing that felt remotely Italian about our experience here was that we shared everything. The menu is almost entirely composed of small plates (really, though--there are only three entrees), which is heaven for me. Even better, most of the plates are on the lighter side. Small menu but still plenty of solid options. You can pick from bruschetta, salad, veggies, more standard apps, and those entrees I mentioned. My goal is always to try as much on the menu as possible, and smaller menus help me a) make decisions and b) conquer more plates. Eats, below:Octo Linea (Octopus, Cerignola Olives, Potatoes, Peppers, Celery): A-Are y'all sick of me writing about octopus yet? Good, me neither. Yet another solid NYC octopus preparation. Nothing particularly special about it, but I'm spoiled in this arena. I typically don't like olives, but I was digging whatever this cerignola variety was. An interesting and yummy flavor component here. Overall, this dish was light, colorful, fun and tasty. Even the celery was good. How's that for unexpected?Peekytoe Crab Salad w/ Avo, Grapefruit, Pickled Chilis, Friseé: A-Classic crab/avo combo. What could be bad? Okay, the grapefruit was a bit strange. I definitely think citrus has a place in this type of dish, but it wasn't totally working for me here. Otherwise, everything else was fantastic. Crab/avo dishes are another one of my go-tos, so you can trust me here. Another light, beautiful plate complete with subtle crunchy/bitterness from the friseé. Grilled Artichokes w/ Lemon Aioli and Garlic Breadcrumbs: A-/ASimple and elegant. I suppose this could be said for the whole menu. Nice big pieces of artichoke with a light dusting of breadcrumbs. Only order this if you're a big artichoke fan--the accompaniments here serve only to enhance the main flavor. (If you're an artichoke newb, you're in luck: they've got a fried preparation too.)Whipped Ricotta Bruschetta: AWhen this came out, I was sure we were being mistakenly served some sort of iced coffee cake. Turns out, this is just how Alta Linea makes their ricotta bruschetta. This is still a dessert, though. I don't care how the menu is broken up--this plate consists of two intense, decadent pieces of bread topped with...let's just say this was involved when Zeus helped to create Aphrodite. I will not say more. *Bathroom note: don't hold it for too long before going. As far as we could tell, there's only one restroom available for Alta Linea patrons, and it's inside the hotel, to the left once you walk in. As one would expect, there was quite a long line when we went. You've been warned..The area in front of the High Line Hotel behind those brick walls has been turned into an outdoor restaurant by the team behind a bunch of other great Italian places: Dell'anima, L'Apicio and L'Artusi.The food here is just as good as you would expect, and as it is enclosed and not directly adjacent to the sidewalk, is one of the nicest outdoor dining options in the city (except for all the dogs, unless you like dogs sitting next to most of the tables).The menu is pretty small, with the bulk of it actually coming in the appetizer/small plate section. We tried something from every section, and it was all quite good:- Romaine Salad ($15)This was a delicious rendition of a caesar salad, so a good choice if you want something lighter to start.- ""Borough Market"" Grilled Cheese ($14)This a really awesome, tiny grilled cheese. It wasn't overly cheesy, but the bread was grilled perfectly crispy, and it was another very satisfying appetizer-portion choice.- Pork Meatball Polenta ($18)Prepared differently, but reminiscent of the excellent and famous Meatball Polenta from L'Apicio, this is a great starter, but kind of tiny for the price. Served in a very small bowl, there are 6 mini meatballs on top of some of that delicious polenta, this time along with some bacon, which is an awesome addition.- Alta Linea Burger ($18)Our choice for the main course, this burger was excellent. With cheddar and bacon and a pretty thick patty, it's up there with the best fancy-pants burgers around town. Unfortunately, the hand cut fries were pretty awful. I am not a fan of this style of giant steak fry, that is closer to mashed potatoes with skin on than it is to a french fry. If only they fixed these fries, this dish would be a true must try.- Cookies ($8)These were not great. They bring you 2 of each of 3 different flavors: Sea Salt Fudge, Pignoli and Jam Thumbprint. The Fudge were quite good, but they all tasted like they could have/may have been store-bought. I was pretty furious that they didn't have the desserts from the menu they posted online, which was probably the main reason I wanted to come: they are supposed to have a gelato cart, including some amazing-looking ice cream sandwiches. Major disappointment.Most of the items are quite pricey, which is to be expected with a nice place like this, especially as it is part of the High Line Hotel. The service was pretty absent, which started to get a bit frustrating. I feel like I need to come back to try those ice cream sandwiches, but there isn't that much more on the menu that seems too compelling. Perhaps when they inevitably start brunch with some new items..Honestly the atmosphere is so much lovelier than earlier photos suggest. Candles, lovely green, intimate tables. Our waitstaff was phenomenal, albeit very very busy. I had made a reservation for 8:30pm and was seated about 10 minutes later. My friend was running pretty late, but the staff didn't really bother me-- they were happy for me to sit alone drinking my wine. This was a luxury, since many restaurants in NYC won't seat you unless your party is complete. We had a lovely rose, and in true ""when in Rome"" style, my date ordered us a frozen Negroni to share. It was every bit as decadent and yummy as you'd hope on a summer night. We tried the Crispy Artichokes and the Funghi Misi Bruschetta (because fried egg). So delicious!Definitely romantic, sharing kind of meal. You pay for the atmosphere, but I think it's worth it to be guaranteed al fresco seating in a garden in Manhattan..Docking off two stars for lack of service, and for exorbitant prices/small portions.If you are looking for a place for after-work drinks and snacks with friends, this is perfect!!! The ambiance is awesome, especially since it's all outdoors in a modern NYC garden sanctuary type setting. I went yesterday with my BF for a small 1.5yr celebration on a nice sunny and breezy day, and I was really looking forward to enjoying the food there.While we were waiting by the bar area, we ordered some drinks - their most popular drinks are the frozen negroni ($14) and the Pomello Punch ($15 - Choice of Vodka or Tequila, St. Germain, Aperol, Grapefruit). Both were SUPER refreshing, but I would definitely go with just the frozen negroni if I had to choose! They often times run out of these as there are only two slushie machines haha.They don't take reservations, so we had to wait about an hour to get seated (which wasn't too bad at the bar). Again, keep in mind that ALL tables are outdoors...so if you are sensitive to the heat, I'd probably come here at the end of the summer. A lot of their menu is made for sharing, so we just selected a few for us to split - Here are the items we picked:Grilled Summer Beans | $13 | Preserved Lemon Vinaigrette, Chilies, Feta, Pine Nuts, MintThis was definitely one of the highlights of our dinner. A friend recommended it and I'm sure glad we got it. I never would have picked this out to order on my own!!! There were so many layers of flavors and textures; loved the fact that there were pine nuts sprinkled throughout. Once you reach the bottom of the plate, it tends to get a little too salty and acidic, but I didn't mind that as much as the plate of summer beans was huge.Arancini | $9 | Salumi, Fontina, Fried SageI love anything that has a crispy exterior and soft interior. SOLD :).This had a nice crunch to it, and a creamy cheese and risotto center that wasn't too heavy. They also deep fried some basil to accompany it.Burrata | $20 | Tomato, Roasted Garlic, BasilThis was also a nice plate!!! Pretty simple burrata in the center, and four pieces of garlic spread toast...which definitely made the dish. That garlic spread was to die for. What I hated about this dish was the $20 price tag. Didn't understand it.Grilled Flatbread | $17 served with housemade spreads (Romesco, Housemade Ricotta, Roasted Eggplant, Cannellini) This was another dish that had a crazy price tag. This dish was literally pieces of grilled flatbread (didn't even have anything in the flatbread like...onions, zucchini, or whatnot), with 4 simple spreads. Good, but nothing to rave about, and definitely NOT something I would ever pay $17 again for. If it was $10, I'd think it's reasonable.Pork Meatball Polenta | $18 | Bacon, Tomato, ParmesanI'm pretty sure they forgot about this dish because it came maybe 40 minutes after our last dish came out...sadly, I was super disappointed by this dish. Not only was the portion super small, the meatballs were tough on the outside, and the polenta was pretty bland. And again, with the $18 price tag, it's really not worth it. Since it took so long, they were nice enough to comp this dish.Service in general was really slow and splotchy, it was pretty hard to track down our waitress most of the time - I'm not sure if this is because the food comes from inside the high line hotel or what. Our waitress had a small section to cover, and every time after she'd help out the table next to us, she'd leave without asking us if we needed anything (happened maybe 4 times). We had also asked about the frozen negroni since they ran out earlier - if I were working there, I'd probably inform the customers when they were available again. But we had to basically ask again ourselves after we saw some being served to others. Later on, a waiter came by to help us out who was much more attentive! But if you are only coming for drinks by the bar area, I'm sure that won't really be a problem - frozen drinks are difficult to down real fast anyways :)..This is a review of their outside bar only so if you are looking for a food review then GEEEET out. I highly highly recommend visiting this bar. It's a perfect rest stop after walking the high line.  It's surrounded by a cover of tree shade which is perfect for escaping from the blistering New York summer heat. As for drinks, get the frozen negroni and pompelmo punch. Frozen negroni was light and refreshing. Everything you are looking for in a solid negroni and best part is that it's in a frozen slushie form. The punch was a perfect accompaniment. The punch had vodka (or tequila), elderflower, aperol, and grapefruit..KenScale: 7.5/10Alta Linea is a new restaurant opened at the High Line Hotel behind the team from dell'anima and L'Artusi. It is a strictly outdoor space, so on a perfect summer idea, there is probably not a better place to have a meal. On the other hand, I felt the food overall was solid but not particularly memorable.The food at Alta Linea is classic, rustic Italian, but I was puzzled why there was no pasta. Instead, you see a selection of appetizers, sandwiches, salads and main dishes. Crispy artichokes that came with salsa verde unfortunately were too salty, although I did like pork meatball polenta that came with bacon, tomato and parmesan. The balance between meatball and the smooth polenta was quite nice without being overseasoned. The ""borough market"" grilled cheese sandwich with white cheddar was alright, but I was expecting a grilled cheese with a twist, which I couldn't find any. The winner of my meal was grilled trout fillet that came with olives, charred tomato, fregola and fennel. The fish was well-cooked and the flavor was modest without being salty. For dessert, we had strawberry shortcake ice cream sandwiches, a refreshing but again not particularly memorable dish.The restaurant doesn't seem to take reservations, and I had no problem walking in on a Tuesday night. The restaurant has a full bar, and I do recommend trying a glass of frozen negroni, which was absolutely refreshing and perfect for the summer. Alta Linea is probably best for day drinking with some bites after you explore the High Line area..Alright, here are the quick hits. Went on a hot (90) but not overly humid day. Won't come back for food, maybe come back for 1 drink if I'm in the area and on the way somewhere else.PROS:Atmosphere - Mostly shaded outdoor spaceDrink - The frozen negroni is really goodCONS:Food - The menu is pretty boring. My friends and I commented on this, and shortly after, a couple sat at the table next to us and we overhead them mention the same thing and even decline to order anythingFood - The octopus antipasti, while colorful, was one of the worst dishes I've tasted in recent memory. We all had 1 bite and winced due to the insane saltiness. They brought us another, as the first one didn't have any octopus in it, and it was just as salty. Whatever you do, do not get this dish.Flies - Decent amount of large and small flies landing on me, my drink, my food, both in the bar area and at the table.Who doesn't love dining al fresco! The frozen negroni was perfect for a hot evening like tonight. Nice outdoor space and we got seated right away on a Wednesday night. We had the arancini, flatbread with spreads, and summer market salad. All delicious! Portions were larger than I expected and was plenty for 2 girls..Came to get coffee at intellegencia and decide to have brunch. Nice outdoor seating outside the Highline Hotel. Ordered a simple Misto salad and their ricotta pancakes. Both were good and the service was attentive. Recommend a visit if you want to avoid the crazy tourist scene near the Highline."
"As a huge fan of Maison Premiere, boy was I excited to hear about this new outdoor venture of theirs at the Highline Hotel. All the great drinks and seafood from one of Williamsburg's finest restaurant institutions, but with 100% more outdoor space that's dog friendly and features frozen Negronis to boot. It's like I died and went to the bar Heaven of my dreams. Looks wise, it definitely delivers. It's like entering an enchanted garden brimming with bitter cocktails and shucked bivalves. On the topic of execution and coordination of the staff, there's a lot of room for improvement. But with a Michelin recommendation under their belt as well as a James Beard award for outstanding bar program, it's only a matter of time until those kinks are ironed out. Wait until this brutal humidity subsides, and enjoy one of the best new outdoor venues in the city. And be sure to order a frozen Negroni..Wow. What. A. Vibe. TL;DR: If you wanna feel--no, just BE--fancy and/or just wanna relax outside while enjoying some good cocktails and food on the west side drop by here.*** FOOD ***We got a bunch of things in the following order:1. Oysters - this was only my second time having oysters but they were delicious. We got two kinds from the West coast and one from the East and they were all great. (I'm not an expert here)2. Fluke Crudo - arguably my favorite - the fluke was so silky and basically melting in my mouth. The serrano peppers were a perfect hit with the fish and citrusy ""juices"" that accompanied it.3. Soft Shell Sandwich - just really really good. 4. Grilled Shrimp - awkwardly, the avocado and tomato totally outshined the shrimp. There was this puffed, crispy rice in the dish too that was the perfect textural offset.*** DRINKS ***These are GOOD drinks. You could def come here just for drinks.1. The Rube Rickey - This was all of our faves. So much so that we got two. The terragon is strong but not overpowering and the licorice tones going on were just sublime.2. Frozen Negroni - CLOSE second to the Rube Rickey. This is exactly what you think it would be. A negroni slushy. But ~classier~.3. The Toucan Do It - This one was interesting. Too smokey for me but the toucan cup was cool.4. The Golden Cup - Very very very fruity and refreshing and delish. Cucumber flavor could've come through more.*** AMBIANCE ***Just look at the pics. This place is gorgeous. And they have great booth/cushion seating outside. Definitely try to come here around sunset time to enjoy it both in the daylight and nighttime. *** SERVICE ***No complaints!.I really enjoyed my experience here. The ambiance is perfect on a nice day and for a second you forget you're in the middle of Chelsea. Our waiter was great, super knowledgeable about the menu leaving us with great reccs, and was attentive throughout the meal. I ordered the frozen Negroni, which I highly recommend. We started off with oysters recommended by our waiter, which were great. The summer squash salad with romesco was my favorite part of the meal and so delicious. We also shared the lobster roll and shrimp po'boy, which were both good, though I preferred the shrimp the the lobster. Portions were slightly smaller than what I was expecting, but there was definitely enough food. This is a great spot and would be a solid option for food or just drinks at their bar..The golden hour is at its silver phase, but shows promise. Not quite ready for prime time at the opening time of two whilst crowds gathered.The super sumptuous front of the Highline Hotel beckons. My server knew his wines and everything on the menu is summer driven including the wines and seafood. Sadly there's is no bar seating, merely tables up against a ledge. Very Fine, but small wine selection and they were out of the most interesting drink- the Mile High Club. Next time I will try the seafood which is pricey for brunch, but hopefully a new brunch/ lunch menu is forthcoming.Second visit and another amazing wine- rose this time, food sadly was a complete disappointment. Poulet over salad sans blue cheese was a very dry chicken over a blah salad. Might stick to drinks at this hour..This place has the potential to be an incredible dining experience but execution keeps it from being so.  Big problem: Service is a mess and totally disorganized.  This isn't the staff's fault, individually they were all nice and helpful.  It is the fault of the management group and GM for not structuring service and training staff.  I had to ask for my cocktail THREE TIMES.Pros: Food was solid, decor great.I'm cheering for you and will be back. Hope you improve so I can give you 4-5 stars!.Lovely atmosphere, excellent cocktails, and delicious seafood (grilled shrimp salad is wonderful).  Still some kinks to work through before it's truly golden (slow service, wrong check given at end of meal), but almost, almost there..Stopped here before going to a few galleries for a drink. We enjoyed the space sir much we made a reservation for after we were done. You have to ask for Charlie . He w as s the nicest server we have had and made us so comfortable.  We could not wait to get back for some oysters . We ordered the medium sized seafood plateau wit 4 east coadt,4 west coast oysters. Two oysters w caviar. 1/2 lobster, 6 shrimp, clams and a razor clam crudites that w as s great. The hostess was super and made us feel at ease immediately. We loved this experience  so nice it was different. Not your run of the mill brunch tourist trap.Rude Hostess!!!!I have been here twice since the restaurant and bar opened and both times were extremely disappointing. The first time we went, both our meals were cold, the pasta was tiny and we had to pay for the bread. The meals are extremely overpriced so a small cold pasta is hard to swallow when you get the Cheque! But the 2nd time was even worse! The 'hostess' who I believe is named Gabriel (could be wrong) was unbelievably rude. My brother and his wife were in town with their 3 kids and we had just gone for a sail on the Hudson in the blistering heat so wanted somewhere cool to grab a drink before our reservation up the road. It was about 5.30pm on the 29th of June and we were told we couldn't take a seat. When I asked why, she said they were fully booked. There was about ten people there! 90% of the tables were empty! This young girl was one of the coldest people I have come across in NYC and gives a horrible first impression to people staying at The High Line Hotel! We just wanted to sit down in the shade and have a cocktail. Avoid this place..Good drinks, bad service... on the food side the couple of things we ordered were subpar..The golden shower is more like it. Don't act pretentious, you're serving bad food out of the old dumpster area for a seminary. So many better options in the immediate vicinity. Hard pass."

Our waitstaff was phenomenal, albeit very very busy. I had made a reservation for 8:30pm and was seated about 10 minutes later. My friend was running pretty late, but the staff didn't really bother me-- they were happy for me to sit alone drinking my wine. This was a luxury, since many restaurants in NYC won't seat you unless your party is complete. We had a lovely rose, and in true ""when in Rome"" style, my date ordered us a frozen Negroni to share. It was every bit as decadent and yummy as you'd hope on a summer night. We tried the Crispy Artichokes and the Funghi Misi Bruschetta (because fried egg). So delicious!Definitely romantic, sharing kind of meal. You pay for the atmosphere, but I think it's worth it to be guaranteed al fresco seating in a garden in Manhattan..Docking off two stars for lack of service, and for exorbitant prices/small portions.If you are looking for a place for after-work drinks and snacks with friends, this is perfect!!! The ambiance is awesome, especially since it's all outdoors in a modern NYC garden sanctuary type setting. I went yesterday with my BF for a small 1.5yr celebration on a nice sunny and breezy day, and I was really looking forward to enjoying the food there.While we were waiting by the bar area, we ordered some drinks - their most popular drinks are the frozen negroni ($14) and the Pomello Punch ($15 - Choice of Vodka or Tequila, St. Germain, Aperol, Grapefruit). Both were SUPER refreshing, but I would definitely go with just the frozen negroni if I had to choose! They often times run out of these as there are only two slushie machines haha.They don't take reservations, so we had to wait about an hour to get seated (which wasn't too bad at the bar). Again, keep in mind that ALL tables are outdoors...so if you are sensitive to the heat, I'd probably come here at the end of the summer. A lot of their menu is made for sharing, so we just selected a few for us to split - Here are the items we picked:Grilled Summer Beans | $13 | Preserved Lemon Vinaigrette, Chilies, Feta, Pine Nuts, MintThis was definitely one of the highlights of our dinner. A friend recommended it and I'm sure glad we got it. I never would have picked this out to order on my own!!! There were so many layers of flavors and textures; loved the fact that there were pine nuts sprinkled throughout. Once you reach the bottom of the plate, it tends to get a little too salty and acidic, but I didn't mind that as much as the plate of summer beans was huge.Arancini | $9 | Salumi, Fontina, Fried SageI love anything that has a crispy exterior and soft interior. SOLD :).This had a nice crunch to it, and a creamy cheese and risotto center that wasn't too heavy. They also deep fried some basil to accompany it.Burrata | $20 | Tomato, Roasted Garlic, BasilThis was also a nice plate!!! Pretty simple burrata in the center, and four pieces of garlic spread toast...which definitely made the dish. That garlic spread was to die for. What I hated about this dish was the $20 price tag. Didn't understand it.Grilled Flatbread | $17 served with housemade spreads (Romesco, Housemade Ricotta, Roasted Eggplant, Cannellini) This was another dish that had a crazy price tag. This dish was literally pieces of grilled flatbread (didn't even have anything in the flatbread like...onions, zucchini, or whatnot), with 4 simple spreads. Good, but nothing to rave about, and definitely NOT something I would ever pay $17 again for. If it was $10, I'd think it's reasonable.Pork Meatball Polenta | $18 | Bacon, Tomato, ParmesanI'm pretty sure they forgot about this dish because it came maybe 40 minutes after our last dish came out...sadly, I was super disappointed by this dish. Not only was the portion super small, the meatballs were tough on the outside, and the polenta was pretty bland. And again, with the $18 price tag, it's really not worth it. Since it took so long, they were nice enough to comp this dish.Service in general was really slow and splotchy, it was pretty hard to track down our waitress most of the time - I'm not sure if this is because the food comes from inside the high line hotel or what. Our waitress had a small section to cover, and every time after she'd help out the table next to us, she'd leave without asking us if we needed anything (happened maybe 4 times). We had also asked about the frozen negroni since they ran out earlier - if I were working there, I'd probably inform the customers when they were available again. But we had to basically ask again ourselves after we saw some being served to others. Later on, a waiter came by to help us out who was much more attentive! But if you are only coming for drinks by the bar area, I'm sure that won't really be a problem - frozen drinks are difficult to down real fast anyways :)..This is a review of their outside bar only so if you are looking for a food review then GEEEET out. I highly highly recommend visiting this bar. It's a perfect rest stop after walking the high line.  It's surrounded by a cover of tree shade which is perfect for escaping from the blistering New York summer heat. As for drinks, get the frozen negroni and pompelmo punch. Frozen negroni was light and refreshing. Everything you are looking for in a solid negroni and best part is that it's in a frozen slushie form. The punch was a perfect accompaniment. The punch had vodka (or tequila), elderflower, aperol, and grapefruit..KenScale: 7.5/10Alta Linea is a new restaurant opened at the High Line Hotel behind the team from dell'anima and L'Artusi. It is a strictly outdoor space, so on a perfect summer idea, there is probably not a better place to have a meal. On the other hand, I felt the food overall was solid but not particularly memorable.The food at Alta Linea is classic, rustic Italian, but I was puzzled why there was no pasta. Instead, you see a selection of appetizers, sandwiches, salads and main dishes. Crispy artichokes that came with salsa verde unfortunately were too salty, although I did like pork meatball polenta that came with bacon, tomato and parmesan. The balance between meatball and the smooth polenta was quite nice without being overseasoned. The ""borough market"" grilled cheese sandwich with white cheddar was alright, but I was expecting a grilled cheese with a twist, which I couldn't find any. The winner of my meal was grilled trout fillet that came with olives, charred tomato, fregola and fennel. The fish was well-cooked and the flavor was modest without being salty. For dessert, we had strawberry shortcake ice cream sandwiches, a refreshing but again not particularly memorable dish.The restaurant doesn't seem to take reservations, and I had no problem walking in on a Tuesday night. The restaurant has a full bar, and I do recommend trying a glass of frozen negroni, which was absolutely refreshing and perfect for the summer. Alta Linea is probably best for day drinking with some bites after you explore the High Line area..Alright, here are the quick hits. Went on a hot (90) but not overly humid day. Won't come back for food, maybe come back for 1 drink if I'm in the area and on the way somewhere else.PROS:Atmosphere - Mostly shaded outdoor spaceDrink - The frozen negroni is really goodCONS:Food - The menu is pretty boring. My friends and I commented on this, and shortly after, a couple sat at the table next to us and we overhead them mention the same thing and even decline to order anythingFood - The octopus antipasti, while colorful, was one of the worst dishes I've tasted in recent memory. We all had 1 bite and winced due to the insane saltiness. They brought us another, as the first one didn't have any octopus in it, and it was just as salty. Whatever you do, do not get this dish.Flies - Decent amount of large and small flies landing on me, my drink, my food, both in the bar area and at the table.Who doesn't love dining al fresco! The frozen negroni was perfect for a hot evening like tonight. Nice outdoor space and we got seated right away on a Wednesday night. We had the arancini, flatbread with spreads, and summer market salad. All delicious! Portions were larger than I expected and was plenty for 2 girls..Came to get coffee at intellegencia and decide to have brunch. Nice outdoor seating outside the Highline Hotel. Ordered a simple Misto salad and their ricotta pancakes. Both were good and the service was attentive. Recommend a visit if you want to avoid the crazy tourist scene near the Highline."
"There coffee is something serious, like every morning before going to work across the street in Citi bank I had to stop in to get the boost of energy. I craved it everyday, like I said seriously good. There pastries are so good the flan is yummy. Now there sandwiches are excellent I had a few for lunch while on my break.Good spot good coffee the girls are always busy but very sweet.Good try ;).I ordered a Cuban sandwich and there was nothing Cuban about it.  Too much Mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickle, ham and pernil. No mustard and no cheese.  We also ordered a beef quesadilla which was yummy..I have been coming to this location since I moved to the neighborhood in 1993. It was known as ""Más Que Pan"" back then, but despite the name change I have rarely been disappointed by the items I get here all the time: Ham & cheese is usually warm and yummy, and today was no exception. Coffee is usually robust and flavorful, and the rainbow cookies a delightful treat, but I have had some stale ones in the past. So, if I have been coming here for almost 30 years and proclaim to enjoy the food, why the low rating?  One reason: Roaches. There were 2 roaches roaming in the pastry display. I did take photos and video, but choose not to post publicly.  I am hoping management sees this review and quickly handles this matter because I want to be able to return to my old neighborhood sandwich/cookie/coffee spot one day, but not until that matter has been rectified, and I can add at least 2 more stars to this review. If anyone wishes to see the videos and/or pics to confirm, DM me..Customer service was horrible. The lady behind the counter had a terrible attitude. Didn't seem to want to help. We ordered a small cake, an arroz con leche, and a champurado. The arroz con leche was taken out of the fridge and she heated on the cappuccino steamer. It had no flavor. The champurado tasted like chocolate milk. The birthday cake we bought was so dry not edible at all. No one ate it. They get a star for using masks..I bought a pastelito from here and it was only when I ate halfway through the pastry that I realized there was mold on the jam and bread. The customer service was ok..Some of the best coffee and cakes in the neighborhood! Must try ALL the different sweets. I love how everything is FRESH. It takes so much work and time to bake such a wide variety of delicious desserts, and it's worth showing your appreciation by buying one of everything :) can't wait to come back here again soon!.I love their coffee! the best in the neighborhood. the steamed milk makes it amazing. the selection of baked goods is mouth watering. they've got these sandwiches which are no joke, giant and filling. i have half a sammich now and save the rest for later. so good!.New to this neighborhood, so I'm checking out where I can get what..Came to this location for some coffee; my usual is small black three sugars.1st- the guy behind the counter look like I was bothering him.2nd- the coffee taste burnt!!3rd - No suger4th- when I asked for additional suger, thinking the lack of suger will help with the taste.  I was given 1 pack of suger with hesitation.I informed the rude FML guy that the coffee did not taste good.  All I got was a oh well with some shoulder action.He than asked the next customer what  you want.Ok.. than..I'll walk that extra block to DD for my coffee. Never again will I spend my money here.I wk for retail and the only thing that makes difference is CUSTOMER SERVICE 1st than whatever products you're selling..I have great things to say about this place. It is a hidden gen in Sunset Park. I recently came across this bakery when I wanted to order a birthday cake for my boyfriend. I wanted a  booty fondant cake for  30 people and I only had 10 days to order it. I was skeptical at first because I've never tried their cakes before and I didn't want to have a bad experience. However, I took a risk and I couldn't be happier. My booty cake that I envisioned came to life. They did such a excellent job. I ordered vanilla cake with vanilla and chocolate filling and it was heavenly delicious! The price was very reasonable! I'm definitely coming back here to order more cakes for sure..Love this bakery eat in lunch and snack place  they have the greatest pastries. There is a lot Latino community here Sunset Park Brooklyn and the shop is typical of a Latino bakery.Just to clarify when I say typical Latino I don't mean A)insects in the corner b) graffiti on the wall C) your women will be harassed by gangbangers as they walk inD) lowrider automobiles with hydraulics going up and downNo I mean you will have very colorful cakes and cupcakes of lavender and pink  along very delicious cakes cookies and ice cream cakes & Photo cakes another excellent choice  will be rice pudding & bread pudding. I love the coffee it's one of the best you could ever get and of course Cubano sandwiches are excellent"
"Just had a little burger.  Came out quick, as ordered with a crispy edge to boot!.  It's not Shake Shack but it doesn't have to be.  It's a very good burger built your way.  This Columbia Un. location is consistently good..I ordered large fries for $8.39 with the expectation that they will give me the 'Five Guys Portion' of fries. But nope. Just a cup-full of fries. No more fries in the paper bag.Who charges $8.39 for this amount of fries? Really Five Guys?Please make this right..I ordered delivery and got my food delivered in a decent time, but opened the bag and was given the completely wrong order. Called the restaurant and they put me on hold for over 20 minutes, called back no answer. Worst costumer service!.Yes, I'm 7 months late..April 2021. Parking is very limited, your best bet is to double park and have someone wait in the car. Outside is very sketchy. You have people hanging out in front of the restaurant which is next to a Chipotle. Food was great! Maybe because I was extra starving. Lol. Ordered a well done bacon cheeseburger with Mayo & lettuce. Fries were good as long as they come fresh out the fryer..Disappointed! We order from them at least once a month. I hate that I have to go through a delivery service but it is what it is. I ordered a Little Bacon Burger and forgot to get the cheese. So once we got the order I went to add the cheese and the hamburger patty had a huge chunk out of it. and you can tell that it was cooked that way because the area was seared on the edges where the rest of the patty would have been so technically I got 3/4 of a patty. It is already super expensive with delivery let alone trying to get something fixed. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!.I usually take a delivery order with a pinch of salt, but five guys near Columbia always delivers. Granted, it's 2 blocks away so even delivery is pretty quick, but I digress. No frills, quality ingredients, and a friendly staff for the days you do stop into the brick and mortar. They also NEVER skimp on the fries. They always fill the bag regardless of location, but I always feel like I'm getting even a little more than the typical portion here. My wife and I can split a small and still feel like it was almost too much. Again, if you're ordering from 30 blocks away, sure. This might not travel well in the dead of winter. That said, it's a great fast food option in a neighborhood with only so many fast food burger options..I came down to this location a few days ago and it was legit. Service was A1 from the cashier, (tall, thick, white boy) on down. Coke freestyle machines appear to be in service. I got all the toppings I asked for, fries straight from the oil piping hot. Got home and my food was still warm. Seating capacity has resumed at 35%, so folk were inside eating. They were good to me..I never thought that I would give a Five Guys locations a low rating. But there is a first time for everything.I ordered from this location after finding it on UberEats. I was craving their burgers, which I had on the regular back home in California.I ordered a hamburger, with my usual toppings. Simple enough, I didn't think the folks here would mess it up. But I was wrong.The topping where not what I ordered, and the burger was cold and stale. It looked like it's been sitting under a heat lamp for a day or two.The Five Guys locations in California are legit, at least the ones I went to on the regular. But this locations gives Five Guys a bad name.Come on, people, get it together!.Very greasy burgers and fries. Hot dogs are more typical. Decent for a quick bite, but may be a bit heavy..I've been coming to this Five Guys location for years. I loooove their burgers and the fact that you can customize them and add all kinds of toppings. They always give a ton of fries so I never get anything bigger than the small size. The location is pretty big with plenty of seating and its wheelchair accessible. It's always in order and very clean. I like that you can eat as many peanuts as you want while you're there, they're pretty good. There's also a little section where you can leave love notes/recommendations for the restaurant. Id say its a little on the pricey side but worth it."
"I often come to this place for lunch since it's very close to my work, I only order the lunch special here so I can't comment on the items on their menu.  The first few times I've been here, it was always pleasant.  Their stews are very flavorful, the meat is tender, especially the chicken, it just falls off the bones tender! Their rice and beans in my opinion are made just right.  After all that being said, I have to  complain about this new lady that started working there, I've always come here and order either the chicken stew or the rotisserie chicken, I always ask for the leg and thigh part only, the ladies before always gets it right but for the last few weeks, I always get the same lady and I don't know if she didn't understand English or just didn't care, she always give me the breast when I ask for leg!  I know I know white meat are healthier.. but I want my chicken legs lady!  I mean the food still tastes good but the order weren't right and on top of that, she didn't give me any sweet plantains. lol"
"Fiod is good and the ladies are nice. Always good tasting food and variety also . Reasonable prices on the menu. Have been going there right after doris unisex salon to do my hair and Judy's nail salon right opposite MI case. I make it a day of beauty and food . Treat yourself and love yourself..Ordered for delivery on a weeknight and food arrived quickly. Ordered roast pork, quarter chicken, empanada, rice, sweet plantains & avo. Everything taste super bland and meats were very dry. So disappointed, I only enjoyed the plantains..My friend and I decided to order from Mi Casa because we worked up an appetite after talking, watching movies, and drinking Sangria. We've never ordered from here before, but decided to give  Mi Casa a try. She ordered the 2 Shrimp Mini Mofongo. I ordered the Fried Chicken Chunks, Yellow Rice, Habichuelas, and a Beef Empanada. The food was just okay. My friend didn't realize she ordered the mini mofongo. We're accustomed to Mofongo being in a red sauce not an Alfredo garlic sauce. I didn't care for the sauce because it tasted like pasta sauce and didn't pair well with the mini Shrimp Mofongo. The yellow rice wasn't bad but need a tad bit more seasoning. The chicken chunks were tasty and juicy, but I thought the chunks would be boneless and fried in a flour batter. Unfortunately that was not the case. Also I was not a fan of the habichuelas. The empanada was tasty..I'm not one to leave bad reviews but this restaurant called me one hour after I placed my order to let me know that they won't be able to deliver to my place. At a time when most restaurants around me are closed. They didn't even seem apologetic or anything and when I was asking questions they kept on hanging up on me.I usually support small businesses but not this one.  This one does not deserve anyone's support..I chose takeout here. The food is reasonable for the price and they do give a lot. I got their Chicken Combo meal and an order of Carne Guisada. The food was good and the service was good. I don't know how their delivery is but judging by past reviews the safer bet is to order takeout. I will be back.9.Worst restaurant ever and so unprofessional. I ordered my food at 7 pm and then 8:15 comes. Still no food so i call to check. They said it was on the way. I called at 9:15 and i ask again where is my food. The lady asks what i ordered and what was my address again. I repeat everything like 10 times. Then I said why it is taking so long I only live 10 mins from the restaurant. She said because its raining. Like that is no excuse to take 2 hrs to deliver food. Then says i need to call grubhub for my money back. They are so unprofessional blaming the rain for such a late delivery. If you cant deliver food at a prompt time then dont offer delivery. Also, no one speaks English there which I understand its a Dominican restaurant. However, not everyone speaks English in the USA. Thank goodness I know spanish but not everyone does. I would never order from this restaurant again. SO UNPROFESSIONAL!.Service was fine! I was surprised that they had Colombian & Ecuadorian soda so of course I had to have it with my Tres Golpes! The food was good except for the mangu..it definitely could have been better!.If you want amazing Spanish food, please go somewhere else. This by far was the worst food I've ever tasted ever. I ordered the steak and all they gave me was thin, dry, burnt, and the bad parts of the steak. I had to throw it out and when I called to complain they didn't care or even make it right by my end. They want to issue a refund and when they said they would talk to a manager, they never called back to follow up and blocked our number so we couldn't call them.The employees were rude as well and talking in front of my face in Spanish degrating me and how I looked them not knowing I understood Spanish very well. Completely unprofessional and will NEVER come here again!.Nice comfy spot to enjoy some classic Dominican eats. Servers are always nice and friendly. Their roasted chicken is nice and juicy. The fries are crisp, and delicious. They have a wide selection of drinks. The mix/pick platter is nice however it's kind of greasy. Beans and rice is done nicely. The bread pudding is good..The food was delicious but really expensive for the amount that you get. I think it was $16 for a small portion of pork, beans and rice. There is a menu for sandwiches and a menu for burritos. They offer the burrito options as rice bowls which I appreciate for a lower-carb option but they do not have many choices. I was looking for a chicken option and it appeared to only be available as a sandwich. I would try elsewhere in the airport."
"Came here with a friend after our laser hair removal session (which is hidden in the back of this cafe). My first impression of this place wad that the interior decoration was super cute and definitely targeted more towards female - pink is their theme color for sure :)We each got the rosé gold, which was served in a very cute glass. For dessert, we decided to share the matcha parfait, which was so delicious and taste exactly like the ones I've tried in Japan. The staff were all super friendly and offered us free coffee, which was super generous of them.Overall, it was a positive experience and will definitely be coming back here again! Can't wait to try all of their desserts, since they all look very tasty! Highly recommend if you're looking for a cute place to relax and catch up with your friends!.The earl grey milk tea snow aka super fine, fluffy shaved ice, otherwise known as the ""she's a cu-tea"", was the standout here! It came was milk tea pudding and fruit jelly in the bottom and a cookie and pocky stick stuck in whipped cream with milk tea drizzle. Everyone agreed they would order again.We also got the mocha crepe, which came with mocha custard, whipped cream, and fruit on top. I'm not a crepe person and the mocha also wasn't very prominent so I wouldn't get this again. It wasn't bad, just not for me.All the desserts are really instagrammable here! I'd return to try the other shaved ice options, parfaits, and possibly the croffles..I decided to try this place out today, it was absolutely adorable.The aesthetic of the place is really cute, you can see they definitely put alot of thought into it. I ordered the ""she's a cu-tea""/Milk Tea Shaved Ice and the Single Croffle.Milk Tea Shaved Ice- adorable, tasty, good milk tea flavor. Yummy. Pretty good complex flavors, the creamyness of the top whipped cream went good with the milk tea flavored ice and pudding, the bottom jelly added good sweetness and texture. Definitely a winner.Single Croffle-beautiful, crispy outside, light and airy inside, good butter flavor, slight thyme flavor and slightly sweet but not too much. Really tasty.Overall:  These are the small businesses I love to see More of, cute small places that are not afraid to try something different. The dishes were absolutely beautiful, great presentations, the service was friendly but more importantly the dishes were tasty. I highly recommend trying this place out. It's a winner..Came in here on a Thursday afternoon and it was sooo cute! I was so excited to try this place after Hanamizuki had closed down and  glad I visited this place! We got the Lemon Ginger tea; Chamomile Lavender tea; and So Matcha Love Crepe. Chamomile Lavender Tea; 3.5/5; I didn't really enjoy the tea since the lavender definitely overpowered the chamomile. So Matcha Love Crepe; 4.5/5; The crepe definitely saved itself from the ratings! The whole presentation was immaculate and it was so cute! It had different variations of fruits and desserts on top which was something new! The matcha wasn't overpowering which was great and the crepe itself was very good. I would get this again. Service; 4/5; they were really attentive and quick with their service. Overall; I'll try different drinks next time, it was kind of a disappointment. However, their desserts were on point. I would definitely come back again to try their desserts!.This place is quaint and beautiful. The scenery is gorgeous, perfect for photos. The menu is simple and straightforward. I had the Speak it into Fruition parfait and it was delicious. A lot of places have beautiful desserts with bland flavors but the parfait was just the right amount of sweetness with real fruit. The macaroon on top was soft and rich. Each part of the parfait added it's own flair. I highly recommend it. My friend ordered the Look at that Wo-mango shaved ice and said that it was delicious as well. This is a great place to go after dinner to get something sweet and chat. It was a bit cold outside so it was good to have somewhere warm to sit. They have cool bags to put your coats in and hang under the table. The hostess was extremely friendly and attentive. She made sure that we had everything that we needed. There is a restroom inside towards the back. There are also cute hand sanitizer stations..Truly a hidden gem!  Came here with a friend and thought about only getting coffe or tea and just couldn't resist the menu!  The early gray milk tea shaved ice is one of the most amazing and truly unique desserts I have ever eaten and will definitely be back to try it again!  The shaved ice desserts are truly unique, instead of just a syrup on top the ice desserts have the flavor throughout the ice meaning a consistent taste the whole time, at the bottom was an earl gray milk tea jelly and then light cirtus jellies to refresh at the end.  My friend got the matcha green tea one which was excellent as well but the earl gray one is something unique and special to this place, if you go it is a must!  I hope they add an earl gray milk tea drink or latte to their beverage menu!!.Love this new Asian dessert lab right on 29th Street! The cafe itself is really cute with lots of pink decor and neon signs. The staff is super friendly and it's an open kitchen so you can even see your food being made. They have croffles (crossaint + waffle) that you can get one of or you can ask for a tower that comes in a beautiful cake plate. They also have fresh crepes, parfaits and shaved ice or snow sundaes (bingsoo but made with milk so it's creamier). Everything was divine. I especially loved my mango snow sundae. Do yourself a favor and check this place out!.I love everything about this dessert spot. I came around 4pm and it wasn't crowded so thankfully I was able to be seated. We ordered a camomile lavender iced tea , queen snow she's a cutie and a meant to bean (around 47$). The shaved ice was immaculate. There were alot of random ingredients thrown into both which are described on the menu if you're curious. Service was wonderful. I think it was worth it plus we weren't kicked out after finishing..When first walking in, I couldn't get over how cute everything was. This used to be a cafe with amazing onigiri and egg pudding, and it was amazing to see how the neutrals had transformed into a pastel paradise. We ordered the Matcha Latte, On a Roll Crepe, Speak it to Fruition Parfait, and She's a Cu-Tea Snow Sundae. My friend's favorite was the crepe that was tender, filled with fluffy, slightly sweetened whipped cream and sliced fruits. My husband's favorite was the snow sundae, jelly and milk tea pudding topped with milk tea shaved snow. My favorite was the parfait, with layers of jelly, cake, custard, fruit, ice cream and whipped cream. Everyone enjoyed everything commenting on how everything was done well and nothing was too sweet. I did not try the matcha latte, but my cousin enjoyed it. Service was also great. Our server was very friendly and attentive. Everything was a perfect end to 2021, no complaints. Definitely hoping to bring the happiness felt from Sweets Laboratory into the new year..the cutest desserts + kindest service + cute interior !! need i say more? def get their snow sundaes for a light treat or their croffles if you love a good, sweet crunch  their matcha crepe has pudding inside so that was new but v appreciated and loved!"
"Veryyyy cute and calming cafe. I arrived at 5:30 pm and saw their rice ball dishes. My eyes fell on the matcha cake roll and I was trapped. I ordered the matcha cake roll. No regrets!The theme is countryside-chique, decorated with tasteful dried flowers, along the off-white walls with pale green trims. The space has about 8 tables with pale green bench seating. They also have wall space for you to sit on the high stools. Great for groups to catch up and have a snack..3.5/5I stopped by on a Sunday afternoon to catch up with friends. The space is incredibly spacious and a great place to catch up with friends. The coffee was cake roll was average at best. There were a few matcha drinks available, and the only espresso option was drip coffee. I was surprised that they didn't have any espresso options. The coffee was lukewarm and not very good for a ~$3.75 price tag. I tried a green tea cake roll (1 of 3 flavors) which was $7 and overpriced for what it was. It wasn't bad, but it was a pretty average pastry that you can get for much cheaper in the nearby K-town. I haven't had the lunch combo, but I'm definitely curious about it and may be back to try it. My friend tried one of the rice rolls and said it was pretty average. +No wifi.Came here for a quick bite before a Rangers game. Really cute cafe that's clean and offers fruit-infused water. The food was underwhelming and pricey for what it was worth. The onigiri rice balls were on the smaller side, which really didn't bother me, but were also incredibly bland - I couldn't really tell which was which because both just tasted like slightly-oiled rice. I'm so used to the delicious onigiri with generous amount of fillings from Harper's Bread House that this just subpar in comparison. The two sides were so small - think dipping sauce/condiment cups instead of ramekins and tasted okay. The soup was the only thing that was good. Overall, nice environment and cute presentation if you're into Instagram. The dinner set is not worth it, and there are better places for onigiri like the one suggested above..Cafe Hanamizuki is a delightful housewarming cafe that offers tea and light meals. The space is very warm and cozy. It's perfect for those who seek rest, a place to write, or catch up with friends. No loud music. Clean, quaint, and a place to rejuvenate.I ordered green tea latte and a dinner combo of rice balls, appetizer, salad, and soup. The green tea latte was dense with flavor and uplifting to drink. The rice balls were pre-made and displayed on the counter so I worried how long rice balls have been sitting, but they were fresh and delicious even though they were small. I didn't expect to feast on a heavy meal. The hawaiian and sweet potato were the highlights.There is no wifi in this cafe. I'd figure it's a good thing. Come not to eat, but rather to relax and enjoy a conversation with friends. This cafe is a hidden gem of peace and rest in a city that never sleeps..Cute interior with your typical minimalist wood-y japanese vibeCame here for ""dinner"" - all they really have for sale are the rice balls. A set is $15 and you get two rice balls and miso soup and two ""sides"". The rice balls are incredibly small and you also have to pay $1 extra if you get a premium one. The flavors weren't all that great -- they just tasted healthy and didn't have much flavor to it. The miso soup was slightly sour..? And i didn't care for the sides (i got some sort of root vegetable and okra with a really sticky sesame paste). Overall wouldn't come back even if i had a strong rice ball craving..i'd rather make it at home.I got the lunch special with my sister so it comes with two rolls or balls or whatever you call it, salad, and miso soup. Make sure you mix the miso soup to get the full flavor. We got the spam and unagi roll. We got one lunch special and the matcha roll cake.The spam musubi was sooooooo good. The rice had tomato in it which I thought was so unique. It really added to the flavor. The unagi was a little disappointing. I didn't see enough unagi. Everything tasted pretty healthy but who knows.The matcha roll cake was soooo good. I love the light roll cake and matcha cream. Mmmm~It filled us up and was just enough but it is pricy because we paid about $27 for that. It filled us up for church but after an hour or so I got really hungry again. But I do think they use quality ingredients and I def want to try other things here. I love the aesthetic of the place..Wandered in here solo for coffee/breakfast this morning. Cafe Hanamizuki (similar to the nail salon next door) is nestled into sort of an odd area in the floral district without much retail business, so you might not notice it if you weren't looking for it. I live nearby and probably passed it fifty times before seeing it. Once you're inside the ambience is freaking cute- I'd call it shabby chic with barely detectable notes of steampunk. There's also some kitschy upbeat nonsense-writing on the walls that involves staying ""beau-eat-iful.""They have lots of matcha beverages here, various teas, and hot and iced coffee (no espresso beverages, though). The iced coffee was quite good- I believe it's LaColombe. However, I am basically in love with the matcha roll cake, and will probably be pining for one again in about three days. I am a notorious matcha fiend and this thing did not disappoint- light and fluffy with enough matcha flavor and the right amount of sweetness. The coffee and matcha roll came to like $12, which is kiiiinda pricey, but when for me when it comes to matcha desserts, money is no object.(One of these days I'll go back and try the omusubi. Maybe. After I tire of the matcha roll. Which will take a while.).Visited here with a friend in the late afternoon and had an okay, but underwhelming experience. The café itself is very cute with thoughtful, decorative touches permeating the establishment, and it is decently crowded. While the service was not particularly memorable, and we felt the pricing was rather much for a small lunch meal, I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the easygoing atmosphere and aesthetic of the place and plating presentation. The food itself was not very filling and had a very light, bland taste to it--something felt lacking. My favorite part of my lunch combo was actually the canned matcha drink. The next time I am in the area, I will explore other options. However, if you are in need of a quick, simple lunch in the area and do not mind it being expensive, this place might be for you!.A cute cafe close to Penn station! Definitely the most aeathetically pleasing, wholesome, delicious spot in the area. The plant walls and art make it such a cute place to spend some time. We got a mushroom and spam rice ball - the last two remaining (it was around 6:30PM) and chose the miso soup with tofu and edamame as sides. The rice balls were cute and tasty, though a bit small. The soup was large and filling. Overall, definitely a bit pricey for the amount of food, but for a nice healthy meal before a train trip out of the city, it was perfect..Casual Japanese cafe that serves great onigiri. You get up and order at the counter and bring it back to a table yourself, and you can choose which variety of onigiri that you want. They have great vegetarian options as well as pescatarian options. I had the sweet potato and the mushroom, with miso soup and sweet egg. The mushroom onigiri was great, as well as the miso soup. I didn't enjoy the sweet egg but that is a personal preference. There's a not a huge menu so there's limited options, but it's a good spot for lunch. Recommend for stopping by for a somewhat lighter and delicious meal."
"Very expensive! Best way to order if your in a group is for the table and let everyone share $50+ for this food. Also I WAITED IN LINE FOR 1 HOUR AND 45 MINUTES.My family was in from out of town last week and were referred to Hometown for dinner.  The ordering process was a little sloppy but the food was outstanding.  Brisket was very tender and juicy, probably the best sausage I've ever had.  The chicken and sides were top notch.  I love BBQ and have had it all over the country, and I would put this at the top.  My kids don't love it as much and all were asking if we could go back..Visited on weekday night. Place was lightly packed. Plenty of street parkings available. The waiter checked our vaccination card. This place is pretty self-service restaurant. Low-key, southern style interior.I grew up in Texas, up to undergrad. I really have to say... that this place is better than most of bbq places in Texas. I visited Texas a week after visiting here. I still think this place is better than most of them. Brisket was so tender and juicy. Baby rack rib was incredibly good. Well cooked, very well spiced. Sausage was okay but im not a fan of sausages, so i cant comment too much on the sausage. Mac and cheese and cole slaw was mediocre. My mac and cheese was kind of hard. Cornbread was very good. It's not one of those ultra sweet cornbreadI would definitely recommend to visit..Food 4.0/5.0Service 3.5/5.0Value 3.0/5.0Decor 3.0/5.0Overall 4.0/5.0Really good BBQ. Everything was done well -- importantly, including the brisket. The wings were interesting. Service at the counter. Everything felt like I was in TX, aside from the prices (I don't mind, just keep it going!). Curious about why the Asian/Korean-inspired items. Would come back..Not going to lie, I'm pretty frustrated with this place. We were at a bar down the street and decided after our last round of drinks that BBQ sounded delightful. I called ahead to see how busy they were at the time and the person on the phone urged us to come immediately to secure a spot for 5 people. We dashed over here, literally within 5-10 minutes after our call as we were literally a block away. Upon arrival, we were told by a guy at the door that they were completely out of meat/food. Let me repeat that: They were out. of. food. I'm sorry, but it is 7:30pm on a Saturday night and you're telling me you're completely out of food? Not only that but we were instructed to run over here to dine. I find it hard to believe you had food when I called 10 minutes prior. Why would you even tell us to come? We then had a conversation with one of the staff who advised that this happens WEEKLY. It is just completely baffling to me that a restaurant like this would be so ill prepared on such a regular basis- especially on a Saturday night?! Shouldn't that be one of the best paying nights for restaurants? How is this a successful business model? I do hope to try the food, once they actually have some for us to try- but as for now I'm just left with this bitter taste in my mouth. 2/5.Overpriced and overrated, sorry,I gave them multiple chances but still, it's just not good.$13 for three wings. No.The wings were overcooked, dry, and it felt like they were thawed from a deep freezer.Never again..My friends and I were super excited to find a southern BBQ place in NYC and made the trip to Brooklyn to try this place. The service is pretty good and the meat is delicious. The price point though...a lil expensive imo...at least for the sides. They charge for every single side and they're not cheap. I feel like it should be a given to accompany meat with some sides but instead they charge for it. It would've been nice if there was some sort of meal option to get like 2 sides per meal. Just an idea! Also had to wait like 30 min for the mac & cheese and while I understand they were prepping it fresh, I was sad that I was almost done with my brisket by the time my mac and cheese came out :(.Some of the best barbecue I've ever had! If you're coming for the first time the employees are really helpful and friendly. Let them know what you're interested in and they will give you really good suggestions on what to order. I went with the pulled pork sandwich, a side of Mac and cheese and their banana pudding for dessert. You order first and then grab a table with a number so your food can come when it's ready. The sides are ready and given to you at the register, but your main dishes may take some time since it's made fresh. We came soon after they opened and there was still a short line. The line moves fast, but sometimes it may get busy. The food was all delicious and their sticky sauce is truly one of a kind..So many great spots in Brooklyn and having had the best in Texas had to check this BBQ spot out.  Also, saw the Lamb Banh Mi on Burgers, Brews and Que and was curious.Rustic spot with a laid back vibe.  A good size bar area with added tables in the back & plenty of outdoor seating.  They were semi busy on a Friday afternoon around1:00.   Order at the counter and they call you when your food is ready.  Unfortunately call-in for pickup or online ordering are not available at this location.  Decided to have the Banh Mi on-site and ordered some Brisket and Sausage to go.As a Banh Mi fan I wasn't sure about Lamb as the protein.  That said, the Lamb Belly didn't disappoint-had just the right bite & smoke without being gamey.  Veggies with the pickled Daikon and Hot/sweet sauce take it over the top.  Nicely balanced sandwich and so rich I could only eat half.  A must try!Paired it with the Threes Vliet (local Pilsner) which was crisp & refreshing.Brisket (got the fatty) and Billy's House made Sausage were both excellent and on par with some of the Texas spots I've enjoyed.  Corn bread was buttery and tasty.Service at the counter was friendly and the lady at the bar was upbeat & helpful with the beer selections.I would imagine they can get quite busy especially when the weather is good but it was a rainy day when I visited.   Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.  Don't miss the ""one of a kind"" Lamb Banh Mi!.This is the best BBQ in NYC! The brisket is unbelievable, the ribs were great and the cornbread is the best I've ever had. Very reasonable prices for the quality. Not to mention the staff and service were over the top friendly and attentive. They have an awesome bar and lots of outdoor seating. I can't wait to become a regular here. Don't change a thing!"
"I often drink coffee in the morning before work, Starbucks is my usual place to visit. Unfortunately, I have recently noticed a trend that my order is being prepared longer and longer, sometimes I have to wait for 5-7 minutes, I would like it to be faster. There are no questions in terms of coffee - typical Starbucks, confident, reliable taste. But please, a little faster...I went into this Starbucks yesterday and had a really great experience.. I come to this Starbucks often and it's always a pretty good experience (the only thing I don't like is that sometimes it's randomly closed, idk why that is) anyhoo. When I went two days ago it was extra pleasant. The staff was super friendly and kind. They were efficient and helpful. We had a large order and they executed it quickly and correctly! No mistakes lol. They also offered us a sample of the toffee drink (which was really good btw. Very sweet but tasty!) I wanted to specifically acknowledge someone's customer service but I forgot her name. But she had blonde hair and she was slim and brown skin. Very personable. Also the playlist was great. I loved the vibe this day and I just wanted to give share.This Starbucks was pretty cool. The Music was nice and calm, the store was clean. It was nice. They have a drive thru so just keep that in mind if you're going into the store. Ordering food takes a while because they tend to focus on the drive thru a bit more thoroughly. My drink was made perfectly, and that's all you can really ask for. All in all great experience..Basic Starbucks run on a Thursday afternoon during covid. Mostly empty, the baristas were really nice, they were chatting with the few customers there. Seemed like a friendly establishment. Got a black tea lemonade. Can't really mess that up..I ordered through DoorDash and anytime I do from this location my order is completely wrong. I ordered a shaken espresso that should have milk and this is clearly just an iced coffee. Not only did it taste horrible it wasn't even full. This isn't the first time this has happened and I don't think I will be coming to this location again..Michael is the worst barista ever Very rude And nasty Food is okay Go to Gabriel if any help is ever needed or maybe just walk to the next starvucks.This place is amazing, the workers were so nice and were so friendly. They gave me a good welcome feeling.It's pretty small Starbucks cafe ' , I'll be honest I love Dunkin cafe' and Starbucks  cafe'., there two Starbucks in the area there one inside Target stores and there one outside around the corner of Brooklyn college - where this one is located at . I wouldn't mind coming back here . The Starbucks store inside target is pretty big . If I'm in the Flatbush Junction area I wouldn't mind coming back in !!!!.Very convenient by the mta transportation:Subway:2,5-Train .Flatbush Avenue -Brooklyn college ,Train station.Buses:B41, B44, B6,Q35.Very, very dusty. Not like dirt accumulation from lack of hygiene dust, I mean all around mannerisms and etiquette dusty. How dare you send an order with all the drinks and none of the food? The blasphemy. Do you not have parents in who you wouldn't dare tarnish their legacy? What were you all born into this world for? To fail? If so, mission accomplished. The kicker? The crescendo? The grand finale'? Your idea of a strawberry funnel cake Frappuccino was to put strawberry syrup on top of a regular frozen Frappuccino. JFC. Lord have mercy. The dustiness. The sheer dustiness..WHO: party of 1, moiWHY: thirst, new drinks, rewardsWHAT: (Deets) today, Midnight Mint MochaWHEN: about 1/weekWHERE: take awayHOW: car/ bike/ public transportation bus trainsBATHROOM: roomy (2 stall, separate gender)WIFI: yes, free DRESS CODE: as you like SERVICE: I wouldn't say this is the worst Starbucks.

Kerry was kind to meTIP: half off new frap flavors May 5-14 3-6pm"
"Walked by this place and stopped. What a great choice. Can't believe that a small neighborhood place could be so good. ENTRANCE- an intriguing red awning is the entrance way to a small local restaurant on Lexington Avenue. It was an early evening Wednesday but the staff greeted us rather quickly. We had our choice of any table as it was only 5:30 in manhattan. SERVICE- extremely nice and attentive to every whim. The owner and son were actually waiting on us and super friendly. We even had a third party meet us (after a call to say how good the place was) and they accommodated a last minute order timed to perfection when they arrived. BREAD & DIP - fabulous the bread was classic Arthur Avenue Madonna quality. They had a dip that was to die for. Super flavorful. APPETIZERS - had the artichoke with crab in a tremendously great broth. A must try. ENTREES- wife and I went with fish specials halibut and Bronzino that were perfectly prepared. By that I mean crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. A must try when available. Which could be every day lol. What do I know. VINO - very good Italian selection and not exorbitantly priced for Manhattan. DESERT - so full only cappuccino. Let me know what u think if you try a dessert here. PRICE - for a last minute group of 3 with bottled water drinks and specials, and crazy almost 9% sales tax the bill without tip was $230 so realistically $$$ but more like $$$$ depending on what you order.Kind of worried about eating here since it looked like your generic italian restaurant but went for it since I was in a bind.  They have a cool outdoor setup with a few tables with dividers. For lunch I went with the paparedelle with chicken. The pasta was definitely homemade and was made al dente. I usually don't see this pasta dish made with chicken but it worked. Usually it is made with a wild boar ragu.  The dish overall worked and really will fill you up for lunch. My colleague got the cheese ravioli and also enjoyed it. They also were homemade and you could taste it. The only issue is it is a little expensive for lunch. They didn't have any lunch menu which seemed kind of weird. $20-$30 for a pasta dish for lunch seemed excessive. They also had other entrees for $30+.  With that being said, the food was decent but I don't think I would come back for lunch..The four of us all enjoyed our meal.  The appetizers and entrees, including the fish, veal, salads and steak were well prepared.  The service was efficient and the wine list has many wines under $100 a bottle..We had a pleasant lunch  at Barbaresco today. It was a mild Dec afternnon, we sat outside, in their cosy  outdoor dining area. Waiter was courteous and efficient. Food was very good. The salad was outstanding actually: pear and truffled cheese, full of flavors. My main was pure spaghetti marinara. All dente and tasty. My husband ordered steak, a big portion, and he loved it. For dessert, we ordered tartufo ice cream, a treat I used to have when a child... memorable. It s a solid Italian, we will ..Had a very pleasant Saturday evening meal here with a friend! The heated outdoor seating, delicious pasta (and dessert), accommodating and friendly staff were all a nice way to stay warm on an otherwise cold night..Like many, though not all, NYC restaurants they have (limited) outdoor seating due to Cuomo's diktat that prevents indoor dining. What is also limited is quality both in food and service. The waiter (a Croat-Italian) practically bellows through his mask into your ear and pauses for a few seconds to see if you have been intimidated into selecting some of their pedestrian NY Italian (make no mistake there is no ""vero"" Italian about any of their menu items) fare and if you have not saunters off and returns at his leisure. About the only thing of note was that Spike Lee, although I am no fan of his,  happened to be dining at the next table..I have been going to Barbaresco for years.  It is my go to place if I am on the UES and it has never disappointed me.   I generally order the ravioli of the day and a Cesar salad to start.  It's always, excellent.   In addition,  the wait staff is attentive, professional and kind.  It's a fancy place,  but I rarely spend more than $50.  I highly recommend..Bottom line:  got food poisoning.  Up all night throwing up. When I called the manager the next day, and told him that I got it from the shrimp pasta, he said that it couldn't be possible.  It was possible!!!.Great service! Charlie was our server and he did a  wonderful job!Not stuffy, lot of conversation going on in the place.I don't know what ""smart casual"" means, most people were dressed for a nice evening out. Food was excellent! Ravioli and Polipo (octopus) were phenomenal.great job definitely coming back.So I'm on an overnight work trip here in NYC. Got to my hotel a little before 8:00pm and I'm STARVING. I happened across this little place and I'm so happy I did. The ambiance is lovely and warm, the music is great (70s slow jams R&B, 2000s pop rock, classical, the works!), the service is quick, polite, and friendly, the food is DELICIOUS, and the whole experience was really nice. Exactly what I needed in that moment. I got the caprese as an appetizer - 100% legit, tasted just like the caprese I had in Rome a few years ago. The rigatoni with meat sauce was super tasty and just enough without being too much. The post-meal macchiato was really good and came with these cute little almond biscottis.Overall - great restaurant. Highly recommend!"
"Order:- Chicken Tempura Roll (4/5)- Chicken Yakisoba (4/5)- Miso Soup (5/5)Pros:- Large menu with a lot of options to choose from - Very quick delivery. I ordered through Grubhub and their delivery person got it to me within 30 minutes of ordering it - Large portions - AffordableCons: - Yakisoba could use a bit more seasoning as I felt like it was a little bland, particularly the chicken itself Overall: Good sushi place to get take-out/delivery from. Food tasted alright and it was affordable.Super fresh well sized sushi hand rolls and sashimi for take out ...hand salmon avocado yellowtail jalapeño and tuna scallion ...also lovely avocado salad...only complaint hand maki needs to be tighter and neater ...So far best in this part of queenswill try again for sure and once covid dies down venture inside to check the ambiance.I had the lunch  shrimp teriyaki box.  All the items were good.  Service was quick and pleasant..I ordered sushi and sashimi platter for takeout. When I was at home eating I found 2 long black hairs stuck on 2 different pieces of the fish. Then to make matters worse a little black bug crawled out of the take out container. A huge waste of money and GROSS!!.No longer the best bang for your buck, a three roll combo and a few pieces of sashimi came to almost $27! The sashimi is still really fresh but the rolls were sad. The avocado was overly ripe end the pieces of fish were cut so small, and the eel avocado roll was so undercooked that it barely held together. There's a guy that normally takes the order when I call but this time it was a girl and she was nasty...sheesh, don't take it out on the customers if you're on the rag..I would say it's the the most bang you'll get for your buck. However, the sushi or sashimi a la carte has gone from $1/piece to $1.25 - $2/piece depending on the type of fish. Run-of-the-mill, Yellowtail (Hamachi-my favorite), Tuna, Salmon, White Tuna, Snapper, Fluke, etc are $1.25. More specialty items such as Uni, Tobiko, Salmon Roe will be $1.50. Higher priced items such as Toro (belly tuna) and scallop sashimi are $2. You're not going to find a better sushi place in this area for the price.  Even though the fish is not top grade, it doesn't have that ""frozen then thawed out"" kind of taste you find when you buy sushi/sashimi at a local take-out.  Let's be honest, if you want top notch sashimi, you better head out to the city and pay $3-$8 a piece. This is the freshest you are going to get and be stuffed for $70 for a dinner for two, and that's including tax and tip. (Also, includes over-eating) I also like to get a variety of raw fish and most places where you order a sashimi deluxe, there are only 4-5 types of fish combined.  At Fuji, I can order 20 different kinds at one time. Take-out is just as good.  Don't order on Seamless as I noticed they add an extra $1 for each piece of sushi/sashimi. Look at the menu and call them and order direct..The place serves standard sushi, I feel that the sushi could have been fresher. The ramen was delicious though. I also enjoyed the appetizers: edamame, gyoza and shumai. There are better sushi spots out there so I will not be back..Oh, pandemic dining. Even takeout can be tricky, but fret not, Fuji can be on your list of takeout spots. Decided to stop here on a whim of not having Japanese food since the pandemic begun. Ordered (cooked) rolls, just because, udon noodles, and chicken katsu. The chicken udon noodle was good. Lots of mixed vegetables, good portion of chicken and well-cooked noodles, not overdone or soggy. The pork katsu - can't go wrong with a fried dish - also done right. Crunchy, tender chicken. Decent portion to share. Shrimp tempura and eel avocado rolls - standard rolls and rolled with light amount of rice.Better to call ahead and order if you can so you spend a little less time waiting..This may be the absolute worst sushi I've ever had. Don't be fooled that on Grubhub they now go by the name of Sushi by Cho, which I can only assume that they do as a way to fake out the people who might have made the error to order from here.I ordered the Volcano roll. Something I have all the time from other restaurants. First, it was mushy. Don't know why that would be. Second, the sushi was spoiled. On my third piece, I could tell something just wasn't right. It didn't taste right. It had a smell. Thirty minutes later I was hurling into the toilet, vomiting. Even the tuna roll, which is nearly impossible to mess up, was made with spoiled fish.I'm furious. Still trying to get a refund. But, be warned, unless food poisoning is your thing, you'll want to skip this..I really wanted to love this spot because we live across the street but everything was just fair. Food was nothing special &Customer service is also bland. Covid-19 precautions are taken place here with social distancing, servers wearing masks, paper menus, and hand sanitizer at the table. But, you should know they did NOT take anyone's temperature. No more AYCE btw. Will be back if starving for sushi & everywhere is closed. For now... make your way to Sushi Time / Bamboo Ya (both on Austin Street).We ordered delivery from this place last night. 5 out of 5 stars. Looking forward to a dine in experience soon. The salmon bento box was great. The chicken yakitori   was deliciously sticky, as was the rice. I think it's a new business we will support them. Great food. YUM. It's a 15 minute walk from our apartment."
"I've only had delivery but the food was consistently good. Sometimes you have to be careful with fusion restaurants but Takumi got it right. I ordered the chipotle shrimp taco, Japanese lentil taco and the chicken adobo taco. My favorite was the lentil taco--never in my wildest dreams would I have thought to use lentils for a taco. It was curried lentils with cotija cheese and gyoza taco shell. I love the shell. The chipotle shrimp comes in second--it comes with chilled shrimp, edamame and chipotle aioli. I wasn't a fan of the chicken adobo. Another time, I ordered lentil and spicy tuna. The tuna was also in the gyoza shell and it had sashimi grade tuna, jicama and spicy mayo. This place can easily accommodate meat eaters, pescatarians and vegetarians. I definitely recommend..They're vegetarian-friendly, but not vegan friendly. You CAN order a veggie burrito with one of a few different vegan protein options, but you have to get it without cheese or the ""creama"" sauce. So it's Super Dry!!!Literally no salsa, guacamole, or sauce of any kind!! Not even hot sauce! Not to even mention the possibility of vegan cheese or vegan sour cream. It was Super Bland and only the Texture resembled a burrito, since there was no flavor to speak of. The service was terrible. Before I could order, I literally waited at the register for 10 minutes while the cashier restocked their cups and silverware. (The poor woman's coworkers were just standing in the back talking to each other!)That said, I'm giving them two stars instead of one for having beer..Tacos here aren't very good. Both the pork belly and beef curry tacos were extremely dry and bland. I would not be surprised if the meat had been sitting around for a long time under a heating station. Had it not been for the sauce on the tacos, they were borderline inedible. It's interesting that this place markets itself as a Mexican-Japanese fusion place, but the curry used is more of an Indian curry paste - very odd.I ordered the bento which included a side of my choice, and the grilled corn I selected was pretty mediocre as well. You get exactly 5 tortilla chips with the corn so ration them out carefully. Given all the other things I could've eaten at Chelsea Market, I was extremely disappointed in my choice to come here..As of last week Takumi Taco is now officially on my radar. Thanks to the Ritual App's midtown $1 Food Festival (until 3/22). With this promo you're able to  order from select restaurants for a dollar when you order via the app. For those of you who like me, were unaware until recently TT is Japanese inspired Mexican cuisine. This particular location is in Urbanspace @ 570 Lex. The menu consist of the usually suspects of Tacos, Burritos, Bowls and Salads with your choice of proteins.  The Asian twist comes with the additions of the ingredients... edamame, miso vinaigrette, Japanese lentils and Japanese curry to name a few. For my order I went with a chicken adobo burrito ($2.59 w/ tax & tip). The burrito is worth the regular menu price of $11.02. It is very filling, fresh, and well seasoned. The edamame was a different but welcomed added addition and the burrito was huge. Easily two maybe 3 servings from one order. Along with other vendors @ Urbanspace TT is now a contender when I'm in the area. Just A Note:Other locations @ 230 Park Ave and Chelsea Market..Love this spot!! It's truly a unique blend of indian and japanese spices. I've visited their other location in Chelsea which is equally great. I really enjoy the Lentil Tacos the most and would highly recommend that. It essentially tastes like a zesty indian channa masala in a wonton shell w/ veggies. The unsweetened drinks are pretty solid as well! The salsa is pretty good as well! Perfect spot for vegetarians..I came here for lunch twice with a group of friends. The concept seemed interesting...Japanese fusion of sorts. This particular location is inside an UrbanSpace and has various drink options as well. I ordered three vegetarian tacos. All of them were pretty good but nothing mind blowing. I especially liked the lentil taco which was creamy, flavorful and came in a crisp wonton shell. The other tacos (tofu tinga, and veggie) were also tasty. Overall, nothing here blew my mind but I enjoyed it! It's decently healthy and if I'm in quick pinch and looking for something different I can see myself coming here in the future.Like Chipotle meets Kobeyaki.  The teriyaki bowls are terrific, albeit just a tad salty.  Generous helpings of edamame to complement the Mexican staples of rice and two kinds of beans.  Friendly team behind the counter - they'll let you sample their iced tea varieties if you ask nicely.  Bonus points for loyalty cards and happy hour deals that go past 6.  Be ready to scramble for seating - the market is a madhouse after work..I have ordered online and in person multiple times and would always get my order less than a minute later. I love that they're quick and affordable. I recently subscribed to mealpal and saw this restaurant participating. Not sure why, but it took over 10 min for my meal to be prepared..I may try them again but I specially asked for hard tacos because I really don't like soft corn tacos. Disappointing to find that they did not listen, so I didn't really enjoy..Seriously love Takumi Taco. A little pricey for lunch, but expected for the area. I'm working my way down the menu but so far the Spicy Tuna taco and the Japanese Beef Curry taco are my faves. So fresh and flavorful. I usually get the Bento box so that it comes with one side and market greens. Everything is delicious here. Today I got the teriyaki bowl with grilled chicken and that was yummy too. Decent-sized portions as well. I will advise that Urbanspace gets PACKED during lunch so I like to go around 11-11:30 with the ""earlier"" crowd just to get out of there in one piece. Highly recommend!"
"I want to give a shout out to The wonderful cakes they sell at Capy especially famous for the Tres Leches, means a cake made with 3 different milk ingredients! It's so yummy  yummy! I didn't know if this franchise until they put one in the Bronx near 149 3rd Avenue. The cakes are delicious and not so sweet as most of  3 leche cakes are, the presentation of the cakes amazing! I love the coconut  one, one piece of cake is about $4.50 but it's worth it every penny to have the delight in your mouth. A regular size cake is a bit $45.0o again reasonably priced for the great ingredients and presentation. The cakes can be at room temperature for 4 hours, since these cakes are milk sponge cakes that's the most can be out without melting! The staff is amazing pleasant and helpful I highly recommended to come a try these cakes best in the Bronx! I gave 5 stars because their worth it!!.I like them but I've had better. I've been slowly trying them out but so far the only one I enjoy is the coconut tres leches slice. The other ones are blah so I never really get a full cake because I'm unsure how good it will vez.Today I had a very bad experience with this company because I went to buy a piece of cake and there was an employee who treated me very badly, I felt bad and offended, she made me feel like a person with problems, and I was very kind to her to tell her that I got a hair on the cake but he didn't let me speak, he just yelled at me.Ordered the strawberry cake. I like spongy cake and how it's very lightly sweetened. I wish there was more sweet milk soaked into the cake."
"They did pretty well, definitely outstanding service. Came here for a friend's birthday. Food; Food came with complimentary bread. Octopus terrine- octopus cut in thin pieces, with celery, citrus, and small pieces of jalapeno. Not my favorite octopus, it was okay. I liked the bit of spice added. Mussels with mariniere with fries- probably the best dish we tried here, can't beat that white mussels sauce. I loved using the complimentary bread to dip into the sauce. Also loved that it came with fries on the side. Salmon- with lentils, mustard seeds, leek vinaigrette. Pretty good. Nice crispy skin. The vinaigrette was good as well. Duck confit- the duck was pretty tender. I wasn't sure about the amarena cherries sauce. It's not bad to combine the sweet with the savory, but I'm not sure about the execution of the sauce itself.  Fromage- we had several hard cheeses. I liked the sweet honey and nut dip. Used the Yelp check in offers to get several of the desserts to share. Desserts tried; Creme brulee, banana flan, profiteroles. My favorite was the creme brulee, it's a classic so can't go wrong with that. The true star here was the excellent service. They refilled water quickly, refilled the complimentary bread and it was just amazing how much dessert we got for our check ins..This French restaurant was very delicious. I strongly recommend their onion soup and their NY steak. The only  con about this restaurant is that their seating is somewhat crowded. The servers are very attentive and welcoming..- Cute restaurant in Ktown- The food was ok. I had the Duck Confit Salad and felt that it was nothing special. - Service was average.Located in a convenient area with a cute, Parisian-style interior! The food is good, but nothing special. Staff are friendly, but service was extremely slow. We had to flag down our waiter multiple times and ended up taking some of our food to-go because it took too long. For a table of 3, we ordered: - Petit Poulet Salad - would recommend! the chicken was tender and packed with flavor, paired well with a light dressing- Beet Salad - fresh and citrusy, but small portion relative to the price- Fig Salad - pretty standard with minimal ingredients - French Onion soup - so cheesy, so good! perfect for the cold weather- Pommes Frites - your typical side of fries Overall, it's a nice place to stop by for a cute lunch if you're in the area. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here..The overall rating for this location is too high. This is coming from someone who generally leaves high ratings. When we first sat down, we waited 10 minutes for bread and water. It never arrived, so we left. If we had stayed at that table, our waiter would have been a a quiet guy with a pissed-off face (RBF). After circling around the block and not finding an option we could all agree on, we returned, but at a different table and with a different waiter. This waiter was a little friendlier, but not exactly friendly. He would pour water or deliver food and immediately turn and walk away. The manager of this place was one bright spot. He was super sharp and friendly. Without him, this place would be a 1.For food, the filet mignon was the worst I've ever eaten. I don't think it was marinated. They just put some nasty gravy on it. I ate it, but just to get the protein, not for enjoyment. The burger was very basic without much taste. The salad was just okay. The best part of the meal was the bread and butter.I would not recommend this restaurant. It's overpriced, the food is subpar, and the service is not friendly. Don't waste your money here! You have many other options in NYC. Even the lady at the table next to us told her husband that her meal was terrible. We were staying in the attached hotel and asked management if they could do anything because this meal was so bad. Petit Poulet said no..Herald Square doesn't have a plethora of French options but Petit Poulet is a really good one.  Located in the lobby of a hotel, the restaurant serves a limited classic French menu - salads, burgers etc. that often populates French menus in NYC.The decor is bright and typical French bistro.  Service here is top notch - we were greeted by the manager and seated immediately.  The server then proceeded to bring fresh bread and butter and took our order immediately after running down the specials of the day.The wife got the scallops and risotto special (she said it was great) and I tried their signature rotisserie chicken with haricot verts.  The chicken was seasoned well and cooked perfectly.  The white meat was juicy and the sauce was rich and buttery.  The food here is great.  Prices are reasonable for the area and the type of cuisine.  Service is second to none.  Really great option if you want to take a load off in the Herald Square area..Convenient location for dining after work with friends on a weekday. Service was good, but the food came really slow in the beginning. Overall the food is pretty standard, had good portions for the price, but not too impressive - I would recommend the duo duck dish.Came here with friends for a weekday night after work, and waited for quite a while before we got our appetizers. The escargot was quite bland and not savory enough. The foie gras was also quite standard and not savory enough for the bread - I'm usually a huge fan for foie gras, but this dish was not mind blowing. For main dishes, we ordered the duck, wine braised chicken, and pan seared branzino. The duck was well made - tender and savory. The wine taste in the chicken is a bit too strong, but still not bad. The branzino was not too good - not savory enough and portion was relatively small.Dessert was quite delicious, I especially enjoyed the espresso flavor..Came here for a birthday dinner celebration. Nice restaurant in midtown and connected to the Radisson Hotel. Décor was nice and the staff was friendly. On strange thing is that the host didn't give us menus to look after we were seated and waited until the entire party arrived. I think it would be helpful if you want your customers to order quick to give them the menu to look through while waiting for the final guest.  Overall food was good - fresh warm bread was delicious!!! Chicken in puff pastry was nicely prepared and I enjoyed it, along with the bone-in ribeye and brussel sprouts with mushrooms and bacon that was shared. Dessert: We all shared crème brulee trio, hazelnut profiterole, dolce gelato, chocolate mousse and a chocolate tarte. Get 1 free dessert for the table with yelp check-in.Great dining experience...will be back..Food was good but we had a bonkers experience with our waiter. Our waiter got our orders confused and said one item was out of stock, when it was something else that was out of stock. Once the confusion settled and we had our food, we were happy, but it definitely left an impression on me as you really wouldn't expect something like that to happen at a restaurant like this. Still, the food was good and service was okay. Something had to be off about our waiter...My one complaint is that the restaurant is small and the seating is way too tight. Be prepared to be sitting as close to the person next to you as possible. If this review was based solely on food, I'd give them a 4, but with everything that happened, it's unfortunately a 3..Food: 3.5/5Service: 4/5Ambiance: 4/5Overall: standard food and restaurant.The extended review...Food:House Salad - We were able to split this.  It was a pretty basic salad and a good portion.  Duck Confit - A standard duck dish which was fairly tender and pretty tasty.  Chocolate Mousse - This was compliments with yelp check in.  Again pretty standard.Service: friendly and attentive staff.Ambiance: it's a small intimate place.  Cozy and cute."
"Great atmosphere and great wine! My friend ordered the hanger steak and it was cooked to perfection! Friendly service and all around good vibe!.Le French Diner is truly a gem amidst the roughage of the Lower East Side. Whether you're walking in for a snack or a full meal, you're sure to be delighted by the service, atmosphere and of course, food. The oeuf and grilled bread was delicious, as were the chickpea crepes (if a teeny bit salty). The escargot and octopus were classic and good, as was the steak entree. Oddly enough, one of my favorite parts may have been the potatoes served along with the steak - absolute perfection. Small wine by the glass selection but the ones we tried were great. This place exceeded my expectations and is definitely worth finding time to walk in..Cozy French spot with banging steak and wine. 4 stars bc they will not seat you if not all parties have arrived (due to limited seating I think) . No reservations..Love this cute, dark, sexy French spot. So casual yet intimate. Love the ambiance and the food. It reminded me of a hole-in-the-wall restaurant in Paris. Every dish was spot on..First time but certainly not our last! Very cozy and small spot but great affordable French cuisine!.Unbelievably good foot and a great atmosphere. I wish I had taken photos to add to this review but I was so excited to eat I forgot! The Green Salad is one of the best salads I've ever had, and the hanger steak is cooked with mastery. Get here before 7:30pm unless you want a wait!.I absolutely love this place. Not just the impeccable food but the intimate ambiance and the people. I highly recommend the escargot and the oeuf Mayo. All the entrees are great as well. Note I just dropped into le french diner today and it's not as busy as it was pre covid. It made me a little sad because I remember it being difficult to get into this restaurant before. I'm really hoping it bounces back to its hey day because it's one or my favorite places in the city..I was walking with an old friend in the neighborhood. we didn't plan anything so we randomly decided to sit down and try a French diner! It was such a bad decision!Food was not good! They had octopus which is my favorite sea creature but it was chewy and so tiny!  I felt nauseous after so I really don't think it was fresh! Additionally they need to do something about mosquitoes because I was being eaten alive.Le French Diner had been on my list for forever and it didn't disappoint! My friend and I sat outside and their Covid patio is cute, spacious and safe. They have about 7 tables outside and two tables inside. The outdoor tables seat 2-4 and the indoor tables fit 2 and 6. The patio is heated and covered but still totally open on one long side, so it felt well ventilated but nice and warm. We went early on a Saturday night and they had one chef and one waitress, but the service was still very fast, gracious and friendly, while feeling safe for the staff. They don't take reservations so I would recommend going early even though their outdoor seating actually probably seats more than they typically fit inside. We got there at around 6 and were the second table there but by the time we left there two more tables seated. The food was amazing! We each had a glass of red wine (they only have wine and the waitress tells you the offerings) which was so good - I was sad I forgot to ask the name of it. We shared the escargot which we both loved - buttery and perfect. I had the hanger steak and my friend had the iberico pork chop. The steak was tender, juicy and perfectly salty and the potato were SO GOOD. My friend loved her dish as well! It's not exactly a cheap meal but it's so worth it. Our waitress was super sweet as well. It was one of the best meal I've had all year!.Amazing service and food. I recommend sitting inside, super romantic and feels like you are in France. I will definitely come back."
"As honest as I can be. Could not beat the price. Hospitality of the staff was fantastic. The Irish Breakfast makes up for any shortcomings which are endless. Beds were soso, I thought I booked a king though the travel site but it was really just a delux room with a queen. Little trickery going on there. Marriott beds are the best. So we didn't sleep well in comparison. The finishes in the room and hotel/restraunt were dated and worn, curling iron burn on the carpet in room. Bathroom was showing it's age. Poor craftsmen worked on the tile last.The robes were shrunk but got the job done.Generally this isn't supposed to be the Ritz or the Hay Adams or Trump International. Lots of corners cut and well we still enjoyed our stay none the less. I own a vacation rental so I realize how important feedback is. It's most definitely time for a refresh but we would stay again if simply for the hospitality and Irish Breakfast.Tip to chef: Perhaps Skip the gilled tomato and go for Brown Beans and offer Chefs Brown Sauce..I like this hotel!Quiet , centrally located .Short walk to Central Park ,Two blocks from Bloomingdales, The best part was the price .Definitely has value for price paid .I did not try the restaurant, but it looked inviting .And u can have it sent up to the room .Staff all wonderful .Many fabulous restaurants so close by .Almost all have parklets to offer outdoor seating .NYC , wellIt was not exactly like usual .Almost everyone seemed on high alert .Sadly .ButMany inside places do not require mask , unless u are unvaccinated, soCalif , so used to wearing a mask inside , but Then I worried Might be thought as unvaccinated!Ha I say , check this boutique hotel out .Bed was very comfy .Room was airy ,Zero view !But U can't win them all !.Went here for a drink yesterday. We fancied martinis and the hotel has good quality vodka so we ordered those. The olive martini was decent but not dirty as requested. The martini with a twist was good. The bar was nice enough but probably it's not a destination if you're not already in the area or staying at the hotel. The bar tender was lovely though!.I just stayed a few nights here, but it's a very terrible experience. This hotel is not a three-star hotel at all. Especially the front desk, the one by the window was fine, and the other lady was so annoying and super hateful. When I checked in this Monday evening, her attitude was extremely aggressive. There was no smile on her face. She spoke so fast that I asked her to say it again, and she shouted in a loud voice. It's so ncredibly rude. Never come again!.Very nice stay. Quiet and cozy.Comfy bed & pillows. Waterfall shower head!!! Nice hotel & staff overall. No complaints. Maybe a little old but hey aged like a fine wine!!Value, location, quality!A true Hidden Gem!.Wondered upon the small bar/restaurant for the hotel on a leisurely Sunday by chance. Have to give a good rating for their breakfast/sort of brunch. AMBIANCE - walked into the door next to the hotel entrance. The layout had the hotel bar in the back. There were cocktail tables around (nice size) about a dozen for a happy hour after work scene but also good for breakfast or brunch. The atmosphere was very elegant. ENTRANCE - while no official host station, a hotel hospitality professional came within 30 seconds. MENU - while not extensive by any stretch of the imagination it had enough for breakfast/brunch. All a la carte but even so enough to choose from. SERVICE - this is a strong high point. The waiting staff, the bus service, and shared coverage of tables by other waiters and manager (who btw was in the area even on a Sunday) guaranteed a most spectacular experienceCUISINE - I know it's only breakfast food but place is fancy enough to push the envelope on adjectives. I had a great light American breakfast the eggs were perfectly prepared and while a simple order can be served too over cooked or fried in too much oil etc. these were great. The bacon which can typically raise your cholesterol by 100+ points was not the case very lean. Wheat toast was great as well. PRICE - it's a hotel so don't expect a bargain. In our case breakfast for 2 with tax and a good tip came to $58 so definitely a high $$$ or low $$$$ but the service made it well worth it for me. Lol.Excellent and affordable. Value for your money. Centrally located in midtown. Do it. You're welcome..Perfect hotel.  It's recently renovated and everything is like brand new.  Did not try the restaurant.  Stayed in a two room suite.  It was like the Four Seasons, every detail was excellent.  Near Central Park, near 5th Avenue, near multiple subway lines coming together in one station.  Importantly! --- away from Times Square.  Nice calm area.  No amenities, except the restaurant, but who cares.  So nice to escape to the room after a day touring the city..If you are looking for a friendly, comfortable, traditional hotel head to The Fitzpatrick. Hotel.  Irish flare with the best Irish oats with real Irish butter, bar none. Made our way back to the hotel in the rain one night,  super late and hungry. Sat in the front window space of The Fitz and had delicious flatbreads and hot cocoa. Love, love , love The Fitzpatrick Hotel.Comfortable and quiet hotel with plenty of amenities and reasonable rates.We got a one-bedroom suite for my parents here recently and it met with expectations. Generously sized and comfortable with some unexpected extras such as an electric dry-rack in the living room. The fold-out couch I slept on was comfortable enough.The room service menu was missing for some reason but once we got a hold of it, the food was decent.The hotel caters to many Irish travelers and serves as a kind of cultural halfway house for visitors from the Emerald Isle."
"The atmosphere on a Friday night is great here. The drinks/food taste great. So many pool tables and activities. They have a more intimate seating in the front closer to the bar, perfect for date nights!!!.Cool spot to hang out in flushing after lunch or if you're looking for a space to gather with friends. They have some pool tables ($15 an hour) and some other boardgames you can rent. There's also a bar on the side for anyone that wants drinks and a shuffle board table for those of us who weren't playing pool. A much better place that's nice and clean without a smoky smell..For an underground pool hall, it's a pretty clean establishment to my standards.  The decor is quite nice and it's pretty spacious with tons of pool tables and other games.  Obviously being in the middle of Flushing, there's some sort of serenity being in a nice pool hall.  I got here around 9pm to shoot a few rounds of pool.  $15/hr is a pretty good deal in my eyes.  The full bar itself is pretty nice and the price for drinks ($5 beers) is a good deal.There are 2 TVs from what I saw, but only one of them had cable.  I'd suggest having both the TVs wired for cable so that customers can watch games while shooting some pool.  It's not terribly expensive doing so.  But overall, had a fun time here..The pool bar offers a good combination of pool, table game and food/beverage service. Pretty much everything they offer are above average in quality with really reasonable price. Additionally, with their loyalty program, you could get extra discount for pool playing and beverage order.Worth to try when you are free at Flushing area..Our visit started out pretty rocky.  Showed up around 6pm on a Friday evening and the place was empty, which is not a huge deal.  We figured we'd get a couple of drinks before playing some pool.  I guess the bartender doesn't come in until later?  We thought ordering margaritas were safe...until the hostess attempted to make our drinks, and then asking that the older woman there (who may have been cleaning staff) to shake the mix - literally all lime juice.  Ended up getting beers after that.  Drinks aside, the place looked pristine, which was surprising when I was told the establishment had been around for a couple of years now.  Upkeep is great and plenty of tables to choose from for $15 an hour.  There were also other games, like shuffleboard.  It didn't seem to get overly crowded which was nice..$15 for an hour of pool for any number of people. They have different sized pool tables. Cues are fairly nice. Clean pool hall with cheap drinks. Great place to hang out to kill sometime in Flushings for those that are visiting and are too full to keep eating.They also have shuffleboard but it has no sand on it. Not playable at all..This place is a pool bar located in Flushing, in the lower level of a building. Seems like a cool spot for pool and drinks. Interior decor looks very casual and simple. Pool tables look pretty new and well cared for. They charge $15 an hour, which is the competitive rate in the area I guess.. I'm giving them 4 stars cuz they saved my friend and I from having a meltdown; we were in desperate need of coffee at 1am in the morning! #NoBigDeal It wasn't much..the black iced coffee wasn't even strong, but it's still better than DD.. But kudos to them for trying and being accommodating..Positives: The decor is really nice and the pool tables are very new. Cons: Food and drinks are overpriced and not very good. We ordered the Thai Tea ($4) and it came in a tiny coffee cup (probably around 6 oz). It tasted really diluted. It wasn't anything special. We also got the bomba. It was hard to eat and for $8, it was definitely not worthwhile. Basically it's a single scoop of ice cream with magic shell chocolate poured on top, with some ripped up cotton candy placed around it.The tables are all really new and on a Friday night it isn't crowded at all. I may be back to play pool, but I don't recommend ordering any food here..This place rocks!!! It's around 15/hr for a table. Not bad at all. I used to travel to Steinway billiards but those owners have let the place go as the table are worn out. But this place keeps their tables in a well kept condition. I love the vintage table on the right of the entrance. It's very luxurious like inside. I come here all the time with my friends or myself for practice. If you want to hang out in flushing come here. This is a legit pool hall not one of those pool hustler halls that can be intimidating. The staff here are also very kind and helpful..It's a nice place. You can enjoy one hour pleasant time with your friends for only $15. There are various pool with a bar，so you can have alcohol and cocktail there.  If you do not wanna play pool，there are recreational area for you to play board game.They also sell delicious desert. I like Bambo best. It's shaped like a ball with chocolate shell and icecream inside. Great experience."
"As a vegan visiting NYC from the Midwest, I was eager to find a fine dining experience that would give me the ambience I enjoy for dressing up nice and enjoying a date, and the caliber of elegant and creative vegan food I crave. Candle 79 hit that demographic beautifully. My husband and I made reservations in advance and enjoyed our dinner in the upper floor of the restaurant, which was tastefully decorated for the holidays. We shared an organic bottle of wine, the vegan cheese plate, and two entrees. The service was courteous and excellent, and the food plated aesthetically. Everything we ordered was delicious! As expected: portions are smaller and prices higher, as is common for a fine dining restaurant. My only negative remark would be the lack of entry space for waiting, and a less than attentive hostess at the front. We were sandwiched in the doorway for about 10-15 minutes to be seated for our reservation. Overall, we really enjoyed and would return again for another date in NYC..Disclaimer: No one apart of this review is a Vegan. Saturday night reservation for three people. The restaurant is small and causal but we've heard great things from our Vegan friends so we wanted to give it a go. We tried  different appetizers/salads and shared entrees among the three of us. Drink menu was innovated and the drinks were yummy. We always appreciate restaurants who are socially responsible, which Candle 79 is, so bring on the tequila that supports others! Apps/salad: wild mushroom ravioli, grilled flatbread, seaweed salad Entrees: eggplant Parmesan, wild mushroom crepe, roasted cauliflower Another disclaimer, I am a health nut so I am used to eating different substitutes. I knew going into this not to expect the eggplant parm to taste the same as my Italian grandfather would make it. Out of everything the consensus was that the seaweed salad was the best. Everything else we wouldn't order again..Candle 79 specializes in plant-based cuisine that is nourishing and healthy. Located on the upper east side, just 6 blocks from the original Candle Cafe, is an upscale 2 story dining establishment  that offers chef inspired plant-based cuisine that will satisfy omnivores as well as vegan and vegetarians. Food: 5/5Absolutely the best tasting plant-based meal I've ever tasted.  The fresh ingredients, sustainable source from local nearby farms to table, are masterfully presented to highlight their flavors.  I ordered the Burrito 79, a burrito that came stuffed with chili-herbed grilled seitan, caramelized onions, sautéed greens, chipotle black beans, brown rice, ""mozzarella"", guacamole, tofu sour cream, guajillo chipotle salsa.  It was delicious.  The seitan was soft and had just the right amount of tension. The guacamole, sour cream and salsa were freshly made.  The ingredients complemented and blended nicely with each there.  The Lady ordered the Avocado Salad which was loaded with baby greens, quinoa, black beans, corn, cucumber, radishes, toasted pumpkin seeds, tomatoes, and topped with chipotle-avocado dressing.  All the ingredients in the salad were tasty. Each bite presented it's known tasting note, enhanced by the chipotle-avocado dressing.  It was a nice balance of flavors.  For desert, we shared the Berry Crumble.....fresh berries, almond crumble, almond cream, strawberry sauce and huckleberry ice cream.  Plenty for two and delicious.Atmosphere: 5/5There are two floors. The dining area is spacious, cozy with simple decorations.  Chairs and booths are comfortable.Service: 5/5Service is really good. Hostess, waiter, busters....everyone was great.  Price: $$$Expensive. Hey, it's the upper east side in Manhattan.... sustainable plant-based farm to table ingredients.....chef-inspired menu...it's to be expected.Will I go back to Candle 79? ""YES"".Pros: The food here has so much flavor and the portions are a good size so you leave feeling full! They send a complimentary starter to the table which tastes great. The waiters were very friendly, knowledgeable on each dish, and helpful. The food cake out quickly. We ordered the mushroom ravioli as an appetizer and the ""chicken"" francaise and Ceasar salad for dinner. Everything was perfectly cooked and you can tell they took the time and research to really think about flavor when creating these dishes. Cons: The front hostess should be a little more inviting. I feel like we had to get her attention and she didn't smile until we said we had a reservation. I get it you don't like walk ins, but you should still greet people. Other than this I love this place!!.LOVED this place. But for my appetizer it would have been 5 stars. AMBIANCEIts two floors so there is plenty of space however it still makes you feel comfy at the same time. Comfortable chairs and nice decorations. Simple. SERVICEAmazing service. Honestly, probably one of the best service experiences I have had. From the hostess to the waiter to the bussers- really, just impressive.   FOODThis is the onlyyyy reason that this is not five stars - as an appetizer my date [now bf, s/o to this place for a good date lol]  and I ordered the vegan cheese plate and we both disliked it. I love cheese so much and it's the only reason I cannot be vegan - this solidified my opinion on vegan cheese, unfortunately. However, you do get this apple beat salad that is AMAZING even if it doesn't sound it. Strong, but good. We both ordered spaghetti and wheat balls and it was so delicious. The ""meat"" and the sauce was seasoned perfectly and I enjoyed every bite. We also ordered the roaster cauliflower and it was absolutely DELICIOUS. I highly recommend it as a side, it does not disappoint. We didn't order dessert. DRINKSThey had a great selection. I ordered a Riesling and I liked what they gave me. My bf ordered some kind of cocktail and he enjoyed it. PRICEA little pricey - you can look at a bill of approximately $130 before tip if you have limited drinks and courses. Totally worth it to me though..This is of the finest vegan restaurants of the city. They are located in a fine neighborhood, their food is unique and special (some of the plates are even artistic), their service is good and the place has a very quite, romantic ambiance.The only downside is their prices - a bit too expensive! Desserts were almost 20 dollars each!this time we had the cheese platter for an appetizer (ranked no.2 in my list of all the cheese platters I had), and for entrees we shared the mushroom crepe and the chickpea cake. The latter was a piece of art, but I think that the crepe was my favorite one..No need to write a long essay for Candle 79. If you're reading this review, please note that this is the single greatest vegan restaurant in the country, hands down. It's everything a vegan diner could hope for. Their dishes are innovative, savory, complex in flavors and elegantly presented. Service here is exceptional as is their wine list and cocktails.Everything about Candle 79 deserves the highest ratings one can give on yelp or any review platform. It's a pleasure to dine here whenever we visit NYC and worth every penny..Impressive space, felt like an upscale restaurant as oppose to just a cafe. We are new to vegetarian/vegan life & everything we ordered was very tasty. The dishes were inventive & we didn't miss the meat at all. We can't wait to return to try something else..Had the chance to try Candle 79 after my friend and I were aimlessly wandering the UES trying to find a bar after attending an event at the MET. I'm always surprised at the lack of diversity when it comes to bars in this neighborhood. It seems as if there are only Irish pubs or high end spots I'd never think twice about walking in to. We were lucky to stumble upon a place that seemed to fit in the middle of these two opposites, still a little bit on the higher end feel but causal enough that anybody who walks in should feel comfortable.We arrived at the spot around 9 on a Thursday evening. The spot dubs as both a two story restaurant and bar. The bar is located right in the middle of the space towards the left of the first floor. Booths and tables occupy the rest of the space within the restaurant. We opted to sit at the bar and order our drinks there.Throughout our time there their was soft music playing that didn't drown out the conversation we were having. The bartender was able to get our drinks out to us fast and we didn't have a problem flagging him down if we needed anything while we were there.This spot is great if you find yourself on the UES and are looking for a quiet place to grab a drink with someone and have a conversation. Not so much a party scene but one that impressed me with it's subtleties. I'd definitely recommend if you're in the area..Appreciate an all-vegan restaurant but this place is definitely way overpriced for the quality. The mushroom crepe is very tasty. Polenta fries are ok. Good texture but they are missing flavor, and the ketchup is a terrible pairing for them. The za'atar roasted cauliflower is actually terrible and a slap in the face to New Yorkers, who KNOW what good middle eastern food tastes like. The cauliflower was still pretty hard. All together you could find less amateur, more appealing flavors out of a jar of pathetic store brand salsa. Friendly staff though."
"Incredible food and service. I recently used Tacuba to cater an event at my apartment (we don't live within their delivery zone but they still made it work). Tacos, burritos, guacamole, etc all fantastic..This restaurant was very very good! To begin with, they mediately had the water out and ready to go! (This is important because I am always dehydrated.) The appetizers and food came out quickly but not too quickly. The drinks...... amazing. Need I say more? No? Well I will anyway. Very well balanced and they came out quickly too! The food............ my saudero tacos were juiiiiccyy and flavorFUL. The brisket was perfectly cooked and the guacamole was on point. Got the spicy one but it was super spicy... it was just fresh jalapeño chopped up in there.  10 out of 10 would recommend to anyone looking for a yummy taco around Hell's Kitchen!.I went into Tacuba with high hopes of a 5 star experience given their menu and vast selection of tequilas. If it were just about the food and drinks, then Tacuba did not disappoint. Their suadero tacos, carne asada plato fuerte, and pollo con pipian were next level flavorful. The party in our mouths should have translated to our table; however, we barely had any space where we were seated by the bar to fit all of the platos and bebidas. Forks kept falling on the ground as we tried to rearrange everything like a game of Tetris. We should have been seated at a proper table for our group of 3 especially since I took the time to make a reservation noting our family night out. I didn't come to realize that where we were seated was actually meant for people who wanted to drink and have snacks until 30 mins into our service still waiting for our drink order to be taken. We felt forgotten until this treasure named Rebeca happened to pass by our table and hear our call for help. She was amazing. Managers note this - Rebeca made our experience what it should have been from the get go. KEEP THIS WOMAN!!! While other staff ignored us or dismissed any questions we had about Tacuba trio options, she listened and made drink suggestions accordingly after the fact. Her recommendation of the Pepinada was on POINT! She apologized for the lack of space for us to enjoy our meals, removed things that didn't need to be there, replaced the things that SHOULD have been there, and made sure our meals were not delayed like our drinks and appetizers had been. She came over to wish us a Merry Christmas with the warmest smile and complimentary shots of Espolon. She showed genuine care that made us feel welcome. She is the reason why we would return to Tacuba Hell's Kitchen.Rebeca, eres el gran tesoro de Tacuba! Ojala que podemos verte en la proxima vez que venimos..The food was okay and the service was terrible. If you want typical Mexican food like burritos pr fajitas this is not the place to go to. They have tacos which is typical but then they have other entrees like roasted chicken or mole enchiladas. We tried the veggie nachos and mole enchiladas. The nachos were okay and had some sort of fake cheese on it which I didn't like. The mole enchiladas weren't that bad. They were smoky and not sweet. The margaritas were okay, could only taste lime not tequila. Now for the service. The server took our drink and food order and never showed up again. I asked 3 different people for hot sauce and never got it. When we were ready for the bill I finally had to ask the hostess for it because our server deserted us..Came last minute with a large group of 8 on a Friday   7 pm. They were amazingly able to accommodate us within 5 mins. The service were pleasant and helpful (when I ask for recommendations). We ordered a few appetizers and I have the chorizo taco appetizer (3 tacos) that was huge portion for me at least. The guacamole was delicious and fresh. The nachos were good as well but nothing too special about it. Sangria were on point and strong (not water down)! I'm impressed! They have great music playing but may be hard for talking. Wouldn't recommend it for first date unless you want to not talk to your date lol. Otherwise, fun place to be at and great food for a big group..Having this spot so close to me is dangerous! I am a sucker for their tacos and chilaquiles!!! They are mmm mm good!!!! I really can't have enough of them. Let me warn you, their order of tacos are small despite being three but they are soooo scrumptious. Their chilaquiles are mouth watering good, which is a big deal for me because it's rare I come across chilaquiles that are that authentic and delicious. Fair warning, this spot is almost always full but it doesn't mean you won't get lucky if you decide to walk in. Definitely worth your time and $$.The food was excellent, and I absolutely plan on revisiting this spot in the future! I liked the decor quite a bit. It felt like some effort had been put into the aesthetics. Rozena got herself the fish tacos which were some of the best I've had since moving from the west coast. The carne asada y huevos, a brunch entree, was good as well, and I especially liked the enchilada that came with the steak. It did feel overly oily however, which is a minus for me. Was very tempted to get the pancakes -- in fact, I just might sometime soon..This place is so fun for a weekend dinner. As soon as you walk in there is music playing and beautiful colorful decor everywhere. We walked in and were lucky to be quickly seated in one of the outdoor cabanas with no wait. The servers made sure to clean and sanitize the cabana before seating us.We decided to order the guacamole to start off with. The server asked if we wanted mild or spicy and we chose spicy! It ended up being pretty mild despite having some jalapeño in it. The guacamole was served with chips and salsa. I definitely appreciated that the guacamole and salsa were fresh and homemade, and did not taste like something that came in a package. For drinks we both ordered frozen margaritas: regular and passion fruit. They were well made and were pretty strong. For entrees, we chose the steak burrito and torta. They are both large portions, but I felt the torta was a better value because it had more steak. The burrito had more filler like beans and rice.  Our server was very attentive throughout the night l, and we would definitely return to try out the other items on the menu..If you're looking for delicious Mexican food in a exciting, modern environment, look no further than Tacuba. Everything I tasted was absolutely delicious. The mango margarita was almost like a smoothie: it was so flavorful and easy to drink! We ordered chips and guacamole to start, and I honestly think it was some of the best guacamole I've ever tried. It was so fresh and had a great level of creaminess and acidity! For my meal, I ordered the Birria tacos. All the tacos come with three individual tacos, and run between $14 and $18. Honestly, the best way I can describe Birria is a flavor explosion. The meat was so tender, and the entire taco was a cheesy bite of deliciousness. There was also a dipping sauce that complemented the tacos perfectly and added more juiciness to every bite. The dish was a little spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant to satisfy any Mexican cravings!.Tacuba has excellent Mexican food and delicious drinks! I would recommend the tacos or the pernil and make sure you save room for the Churros for dessert!  If you have a large group, I would recommend getting a pitcher or sangria or the pineapple margarita for the table, it is definitely worth it. Tacuba has done a great job adapting to COVID. Their outdoor space has separate rooms with a heater for each party, so you will be warm and socially distanced!"
"Hex & Co has a HUGE selection of games as well as an extensive menu for food, snacks, and beverages. There's a $10 cover charge and the place got pretty packed when we went on a Friday afternoon. Fun for all ages!.Absolutely massive selection of board games! I came with a friend on a Friday afternoon and the space was maybe a third full. There's a $10 cover charge ($5 for students from M-Th), but after that there's no obligation to buy a food or drink which was nice. We did end up getting the vegan chili which was decent.There were a lot of kids while we were there so it got quite rowdy. Definitely a good spot for families..This place rules! It's a cafe atmosphere with a wall full of games to play, decent food/snacks, and craft beer. It's $10 cover charge and then you can stay and play as long as you want. I came here on a weekday  evening and there were maybe 3 to 5 other groups of people there and plenty of tables more groups. I'm not sure if they get more crowded on weekends though.They also sell board games and trading cards. Give them a call if you are looking for something in particular, odds are they might have it..My friend and I were looking for a place to save us from the heatwave going on. We have never been to any of their stores but have heard of them before. We came in and were pleasantly surprised about how empty it was. The AC was our refreshing savior. We did but okay any games but the price wowed us! $10 for adults, $5 for students and children. With that price, you could play all day! Next time, we will definitely be sticking around to play some games. I got the large orange soda. It was delicious and tasted like it had a hint of vanilla. Overall, wonderful experience and we can't wait to go back..Cool place!! Soooo many games to choose from which can be overwhelming! Good beer options on tap and in cans/bottles, had some pepperoni pizza which was a solid choice. Coffee was good too!.I've been here a few times with friends as it's close to my apartment and they have a great game selection. It's a good spot for rainy days or when you want a quieter night out with friends but still want to do something. Taking away 2 stars because of the service we received the last time we were there. It was a rainy day and we anticipated that there would be a wait but the woman at the front was very rude when we asked to put our name down. I very politely asked if she had any guess as to how long it could be because there were 2-3 open tables and she rudely replied that it could be five minutes or five hours and she has no idea because it's unlimited play and rolled her eyes at me. I understand that she probably gets this question 30 times a day but she could've just said she wasn't sure and that would've sufficed, I simply just wanted to know if she thought I had enough time to go have a meal or if I should wait outside. I would also add to skip most of the food here because it's majority frozen but in a pinch if you're really hungry it will meet the need..Cool hang out spot in UES for games and drinks.  Relaxing place with $5 beers and good snack menu..Went here for date night. Had so much fun. Really chill vibe and atmosphere. Will definitely be going back again they had so many games! Loved this place.The games are good, but they charge you $10 to come in & play, even if you have kids in a stroller that can't even play you get charged switch rubbed me the wrong way. Ordered a pizza switch is frozen no complaints about that it's good to have finger good but...... Waited 40 minutes for frozen pizza that came out burned. I've been here 4 times but this was the worst experience I had so far.To play the games it is $10 per person. The drinks are reasonable. The food should be skipped. The mac n cheese looked like gross soup. It was over $9 for a few gross bites. Game selection was fantastic. AC wasn't working so it was very hot."
"During Cinco de Mayo and National Nurses Week in May, I wasn't surprised to see two of Chipotle's All-Stars, Murphy and Frank, providing a welcoming environment in their financial district location.  As a Health Care Worker, Chipotle has offered VIP treatment to frontline workers throughout the pandemic and we will not forget their kindness and generosity.Thank you for another free ""Burrito Day"" during Nurses Week!.I don't understand whoever is running this Chipotle. I've lived right by it for 9 months now and it's often closed for no reason at all, out of ingredients, or accepting online orders only. It just doesn't make sense why they're so unreliable. Imagine getting home from work at 7pm on Friday and you're gonna buy some Chipotle for dinner. That just seems like a given. But with this one it's really a 50 50 shot because you never know when they're just not open or serving customers..Pros:* Service is fast* Food is good and consistentCons:* Hours are not accurate* Randomly closed on Sundays and sometimes weekdays with no noticeThere's other Chipotle's within 5-10 minute walks from this one. I would just go to one of them instead..Went here twice and I will never go back. I normally LOVE chipotle, but I'm very disappointed with this location. The customer service is far from great. Lastnight they were out of corn salsa and lettuce. Why am I paying $27 for a burrito (which was 1/2 the size it normally is) and a burrito bowl that is missing two key ingredients?!?! This place is a disgrace. My burrito bowl had zero flavor and made me sick the following morning. They have dos toros across the street which I'll be going to next time I'm in the mood for Mexican..Skimpy portions, order system never works - order to another location as this franchise is under management which specifically has employees go lighter on portions to save food costs. I get it that food costs have increased but really? Your order will also just be manually taken when you arrive vs online since their system is down constantly. Go to dos toros across the street, it's literally the same thing but better.I just got hacked via Chipotle's website for $115, it would be really nice if there was actually some way to contact them. This company is ridiculous!I've contacted EVERYONE I COULD and not one person has ""reached out to"" me. This company is horrible, they don't care AT ALL that people are being hacked on their website, and are out money because of their neglegence. I've reported my ""experience"" 5 times and nothing. Every phone number I try tells me that no on can help me. Their supposed ""Web Security"" number, 1-239-458-3944 is a girl who can't even get her management to come to the phone and help me. She literally just told me that her management team can't even speak to anyone in Chipotle about these problems themselves. What kind of ridiculous mess is this????.This is around my 20th time ordering from Chipotle. And they get my order wrong every. single. time. For example, I ordered sour cream, beans, guacamole, and rice tacos. What do I get? No rice, but instead WHOLE CHUNKS OF PEPPER. Out of all the times Ive gotten guacamole from Chipolte, I've NEVER gotten peppers in it. Whenever I go in and order take-out, they get the order right, but don't seem to manage to get online orders right..This may be the worst chipotle location of all time. Never order a mobile order here or it's guaranteed to be completely incorrect. Absolute garbage chicken and small portioning. Always cold and never tastes fresh. Avoid this establishment at all costs. Lazy and inconsiderate workers as well..Quick and efficient with good customer service. I tried their Carne Asada bowl but it wasn't as tasty as their chicken. The Carne Asada was bland and cooked well done, which made it a bit chewy. The lines move fast and portion sizes are good. My only caveat is to check your change before you leave the counter. Since they're in a rush to get everyone checked out, they may unintentionally short change you. The cashier realized her mistake and got her manager to rectify the issue. It happens but sometimes it pays to slow down a bit..Tyrese (Like the singer) is thee MOST professional employee in the building. Thank you so much Tyrese. Food is good too."
"The moment I landed in New York and made my way into Manhattan, I grabbed dinner with my friends at Jeju Noodle Bar. It's a hidden restaurant right next to the Christopher St station and is packed but has nice lighting and ambience.We first tried the Toro Ssam Bap topped with caviar. They provided some seaweed for us to wrap it in. The tuna melted in my mouth and each bite was extremely rich and savory. This was definitely one of my favorite dishes here.Then we shared some of the Jjajang Ribs. I loved the smoked yet sweet flavor of the ribs, but though the meat was a bit on the tough and chewy side.For the main course, I ordered the Wagyu Ramen. It's one of the restaurants specialties and the soup was so warm and delicious.The noodles were firm, just the way I wanted and each bite of the Wagyu was savory.If you order this dish, make sure to mix the noodles well and eat the Wagyu quick. Though the Wagyu comes rare, it cooks relatively fast.I had a bite of the Truffle Bibim Myun that my friend ordered. It was extremely creamy and had a strong Soy/Sesame flavor that was exotic.Thought it wasn't my favorite, it was definitely delicious.Overall, Jeju Noodle Bar was a great experience. I got to share some delicious appetizers with friends and they really delivered with the Wagyu Ramen. The food was absolutely amazing and we all had an amazing time..I had a very mixed experience here. The good: the staff was really kind, the vibe was cool, and the truffle scallop appetizer was to die for! It started the meal on such a high. The bad: that's where the high ended. First, the skin on the Arctic char was so badly burnt that it was the only thing I tasted. At first, I thought that was how it was supposed to be but as I continued eating, I really don't think it's possible that it was on purpose. It didn't give the dish a nice char flavor; it overtook the dish and the only flavor was ash. In my last 2 bites, I finally took the skin off and was able to taste the sauce and the fish itself. It showed me that the dish may have tasted great if I had been able to taste any other flavor. The rib appetizer was also bad. The portion was huge and the flavor was minimal. The ramen was alright! But nothing memorable. So in summary: sit at the bar and stick to ramen and the incredible scallop appetizer! Unfortunately, I doubt I'll be returning after my experience..5 stars for the toro ssam bap, 3.5 for the noodles.We snagged reservations for Jeju for 5:30pm on a Wednesday (you have to be quick because spots run out fast!). All the glowing reviews for the toro ssam bap are accurate; this was one of the best appetizers I've ever had and worth the price! The noodle dishes are pretty similar to Japanese ramen in style and presentation. We ordered the Wagyu & Gochu noodles, and while they were tasty, they weren't mind blowing like the toro.Overall glad we got to try it but probably would try something other than noodles if I go again..3.5/5My friend was able to snagged a last minute reservation the same day. Even though we had reservation we still had to wait while they clean the tables. We ordered Ja Jang style ribs, squid & nuts and ramen. The squid was really good, the ribs and ramen was good too but nothing memorable or special.Service was really slow, took a long time for our food to come..Difficult to get a reservation at this Michelin star restaurant, so I've been waiting to try this place for awhile. The resulting hype and my expectations may have been unrealistic. Came here as a group of 4 people on a Wednesday night  (if you have a larger group, then you need to e-mail them directly and cannot book through Resy). Food: I wish we had just gotten all appetizers to try as the ramyun was expensive and not as good as other places in the city. Adding a bansuk (soy marinated soft boiled) egg is an extra $2, which honestly seems insulting given that the ramen here is already expensive - Toro SSam Bbap ($50): Fatty tuna, scrambled egg, tobiko rice, and kaluga caviar. You basically put this on the provided dry seaweed pieces and wrap it. There were so many reviews that mentioned this appetizer in particular that we had to try it for ourselves. I love toro and caviar, but this version, while delicious, seemed pricey. On their social media, there was uni featured on top of this dish (misleading since the real one doesn't have this), which would have really elevated it and justified the price - Hae Mul Ceviche ($23): Fresh, acidic, and bright with an Asian flare- Ja Jang Style Ribs ($30): Pork ribs with black bean glaze. Definitely recommend - these were surprisingly delicious and tender!  Gochu Ramyun ($19): Spicy pork bone broth with pork belly and kimchi. Out of all the ones we got, this was actually my favorite as I felt many of the others were rather one note  - Wagyu Ramyun ($43): I love wagyu, but this was just too much. The broth lacked dimension, and I honestly wouldn't be able to eat a whole bowl of this. Not worth $43 for sure - Family Ramyun ($23): Pork broth with seafood. The broth wasn't terrible, but the overall flavor was lackluster - Buhsut Ramyun ($25): interesting concept as this is a vegetarian ramyun with mushroom based broth with overlying parmesan foam. It strangely reminded me of broccoli and cheddar soup in flavor though. I could see this hitting the spot if you were sick and needed something lighter in flavor; however, this is expensive for not including any kind of protein with it Ambiance/Service: Does not look like anything special from the outside, but the inside is warm and inviting. The restaurant is quite small, which is why you need a reservation here. No issues with the service Overall: Delicious appetizers, but the noodles fall short of the hype. There are better Michelin star restaurants in the city that are easier to get a reservation at.We had a wonderful experience at JeJu Noodle Bar!!Appetizers:1. Ja Jang Style Ribs 2. Toro Ssam Bap3. JeJu Fried Chicken WingsAll of these appetizers were juicy and left my mouth wanting more bites! My family devoured the food off of the appetizer plates clean. It was such a delightful culinary experience to eat something so common like fried chicken wings paired with caviar! This wasn't any normal chicken and ribs combo either! I'm from Texas and ribs/greasy fried chicken are everywhere in the Lone Star State, so trust me when I admit that these were some of the most juiciest and flavorful ribs AND some high quality fried chicken wings that I've ever tasted!! I felt like I was home, y'all.Also, I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of food given in the appetizers. Often times with gourmet restaurants, the appetizer just ""wets"" your palette but JeJu Noodle Bar started the culinary experience from the first plate!We haven't even gotten to the main course yet at this point and I was already impressed.Main courses:1. Wagyu Ramyun2. Family RamyunThe noodle bowls were where my tongue met love at the FIRST SIP of the crisp and smooth broth. It wasn't salty and I just wanted more and more. The food combinations paired so well with each other. I felt like I was experiencing a symphony of music in my tastebuds and I never wanted the concerto to end. We were pretty full after the main course, but we didn't feel sluggish or greasy. Overall, the entire meal took about an hour and the wait staff was incredibly attentive to our needs.I highly recommend using Resy to make a reservation at least 2 weeks in advance. We couldn't get reservations because it was fully booked so we were placed on the waitlist. JeJu called us 4 days ago to confirm our reservation and the management checked in with us occasionally throughout the week to ensure that we still wanted the reservation.There's a curtain on the entrance doorway that leads you into a very small and classy interior. Don't let the outside fool you! This cute restaurant is such a GEM in NYC! If you're looking for a cute and casual date spot, there is bar seating available. Quite intimate seating arrangements and plastic dividers between the tables are still in place.This was definitely a delicious culinary experience and the were worth the 1 Michelin star is well deserved!!!.Snagged reservations on Resy 2 weeks prior our visit (released promptly @ 12am EST)!The two of us had seating at the bar. We started with the Assortment of Hwe, and each had a bowl of Wagyu Ramyun.The Hwe was fantastic - very fresh seafood organized oh so prettily atop a bed of shredded radish. We loved the sauce it came with, and kept that to keep our appetites whet even after we finished the hwe. Nothing beats a chopstick with sauce!!As for the Ramyun, it was very rich, with a hefty serving of thinly sliced wagyu. This cooked once mixed with the hot broth. It was good, but the price was definitely inflated by the wagyu topping (similar to how $ goes up when truffle or caviar is present). The broth and noodles were alright, but nothing outstanding.Perhaps it was the limited # of items we ordered (just two, oops), but we expected everything to blow us away for a Michelin star restaurant. Definitely fun getting the reservation though, loved that rush..2.5 stars.I'm not a Michelin-star chaser--that shit always seems pretentious to me, and I tend to be underwhelmed with fine-dining spots (with a few exceptions), wishing I had grabbed a delicious and far more affordable taco or noodle soup elsewhere instead. But I'd seen an earlier version of this menu and the options sounded really good, so I snagged counter seating for two on a Wednesday at 7 p.m. The mad rush to book a time on Resy was INTENSE, and from our experience, not worth it.The prices have been significantly bumped up while options have gone down, especially for mains. Ramyuns that not too long ago cost $18-22 have disappeared, and now there are only three ramens that go from $23 (the cheapest) to 40-something. What the?We started with the scallops. The combo of cucumber salsa, chimichurri, and kaffir lime broth had a bright, refreshing flavor, quite tart and tangy, that reminded me of gazpacho. But the scallops themselves were disappointing. At this restaurant, for these prices, I expected high-caliber scallops that were delicate yet flavorful. Instead, these had the flavor zapped out of them, and they weren't soft and buttery at all. Just meh.I was excited to try the wagyu ramyun, but it felt like a major rip off. I didn't enjoy eating the wagyu, which was thin yet a little chewy from all the fat, and the broth had an odd, almost sour/bitter aftertaste. I did like the pickled veggies though. My friend and I generally prefer clearer broths to heavier soups, and we both agreed that the buhsut ramyun with three types of mushrooms was much, much better (and half the price of the wagyu ramen). The broth was quite garlicky and savory, aided by a ton of floating garlic chips, and I loved the mushrooms (hen of the woods/maitake, trumpet, and oyster). But this did start to get salty after a while. I'm glad we added the soft-boiled eggs marinated in soy sauce to both though, as they were perfectly cooked.We got about 2/3 through for each bowl and were very full, but when we asked for to-go containers for the rest, we were told that they apparently don't have takeout containers for their ramyun. What?! This was an annoying inconvenience and pretty illogical since they ARE known for their ramyuns. Instead, we had to force the rest down because we didn't want to waste any food, and we didn't enjoy a single remaining bite..I knew I had to try this place when my Tiktok FYP was filled with videos of this place! I also watched multiple youtube videos to get myself ready and to know exactly what to order on the menu. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed...not just with the food, but with the pushiness of the staff trying to get us to order more...After doing my research, I knew what I had to get. I ordered the fried chicken with caviar, Toro ssam baap, ribs, family ramyun, and lamb jjajangmyeon. Fried chicken was decent, but I don't really understand why it had to go with caviar. The flavor of the chicken was so powerful that it kind of made the taste of the caviar just disappear :( (sad). I will have to say that the toro ssam baap was probably the best thing we had. While it was expensive, I definitely think that was the most worth it item that we had. Ribs were decent, the flavor was good, except that the meat was kind of tough. It wasn't as ""fall off the bone"" as I thought it would have been (unfortunate). The lamb jjajangmyeon was pretty decent, there was a very distinct lamb flavor...almost reminded me of Mongolian meats/cuisine.I think I was most disappointed by my family ramyun. Maybe my expectations were just too high, but I thought it was super ordinary. For a noodle restaurant with a Michelin star, I was expecting a lot more I guess? Flavor of the broth was alright, but the noodles were kind of forgettable. We knew we had to hit a minimum spend amount, but the servers were just very pushy about making sure that we hit the minimum. We ordered a lot for 5 people, even WINE, but we were still unable to hit the minimum spend. To try and hit this minimum, someone in my party thought of a really good idea as to doing take out for ramen, but the server told us that they don't do take out....so we were left with around 50 bucks that we HAD to spend on something (mind you our party was already VERY stuffed). We were a little disappointed that the server said we couldn't takeaway, to which he responded ""that's why I told you guys multiple times to order more previously"".... I was a little bit in shook...Overall, I was really excited to go to this place!! It has a Michelin star, but overall was kind of underwhelmed and kind of left with a bad impression..Wow I have not been this impressed by ramen since I was in Japan 2 years ago. Such a perfect broth with such a perfectly chewy noodle- it could not have been better. To top it off, 18 dollars for a bowl of noodles in Manhattan is a steal for this level of quality. I recommend getting reservations in advance. It was too dark to get a good photo of the food but the ambiance was very nice as well."
"One of my favorite local spots. Will always call in to see Darlene if we see her as we're walking by. It's a great cosy local.Decent bar a few blocks from me. Was not packed, but did have a few Irish patrons gossiping over some Guinness. Our Bartender was very attentive, and was glad to see us. My uncle took us here and ordered a round of Heineken. 5 stars for being a local..Kinda funKinda divyThe staff and patrons were nice.  Very Irish.  If you live near, add another star.  If you don't live near, I'm not sure if you should venture out of your way..Cheap drinks, great staff. They don't have any single malt scotch. When I asked for blended(Chivas/Black Label) I was disappointed again.It really didn't matter though, I had a great time. The crowd was great(they were having a party). My friend and I enjoyed our Guinness and Jameson..."
"ordered from uber eats since I wanted japanese food & the reviews looked goodtako wasabi- not really a fan. this was my first time trying raw octopus and the texture/ chew really threw me off. I also did not like the wasabi flavoring, but it was an experience that I probably will not try againagedashi- this had glowing reviews, but sadly, I did not relate. maybe because it was a to-go order, the quality wasn't the best... the tofu was extremely soggy and oily. the skin tasted and felt like it was drenched in oil. after dipping it in its sauce, it did taste good but I wish the tofu was crispier or at least dry. gesso calamari- the taste was good since I'm a fan of calamari, but I did not like the dipping sauce it came with (mayo). I just squeezed the lemon over it and it was still delightful!hiyashi cold ramen- actually so good! the highlight of the meal and the savior of this review! it was very refreshing and unique. I have never heard of or tasted cold ramen and although the toppings were mostly vegetables (and an egg), I thoroughly enjoyed this dish! the sauce tasted like sesame or peanuts and it was almost like eating a noodle salad. there was a little hot mustard (?) included which I thought was random but my bf mixed it in and it added a nice subtle flavor!I'd like to try the food again, but definitely in the restaurant..We came by on a Sunday night when it wasn't very busy.. They still sat us outside (they really need to open up the inside which i think is being used for storage or something) The outdoor seating area smelled very heavily of urine. it was pretty bad. also they didn't have sapporo. how do you run a japanese restaurant without sapporo lolthe food was decent, but the urine smell kinda ruined it. I'd try this again if they ever open up the indoor area, but if the only option is that outdoor seating thing, it'll be a pretty hard pass..This place is open LATE. We rolled through on a cold Tuesday night at 1am, after getting back from the airport. The restaurant is homey and reminds me of the cute family owned restaurants in Japan.The outdoor seating was warm and cozy, each equipped with it's own space heater. We were seated next to a group of Japanese customers, you know a place is good when the locals go :pWe ordered oyaka don and kitsune udon, made, I really appreciated the housemade tofu (yum!) Can't wait to go back to try their highly rated chicken nanban!.Great takeout, will definitely need to come for a late night snack. The Udon portion was big and the tempura rice was a nice crunchy addition. We also ordered gyoza, which were standard--hard to mess up. The pork tonkotsu was also delicious, although portion was smaller than some other places I've ordered from..Some friends and I after heading out from bars around midnight were looking for a place to eat. After feeling weary from our long night out, we were on the grind to find a sit-down restaurant because after all it is the city that never sleeps..there must be some place that'll fulfill us. After searching thoroughly through Yelp we came across this restaurant serving quality Japanese food located in East Village and open until 3AM for dine-in, it was meant to beThis place was pretty small and can be harder to spot. The outdoor dining looked a bit make-shift, but actually ended up being a complete vibe. It resembled one big shed and each section by was completely closed off so it felt like an intimate, quieter space to enjoy your meal. We order some sake to start. I asked for the most popular sakes and Kitaya was one of them. It had a hint of fruitiness and was super smooth. For food we got pork yakiniku, which is a BBQ pork belly with grilled onions. I'm a pork belly fan and this was just delicious, the BBQ intensity was just right and paired with onions brought out a delicious mix of flavor. The other dish was chicken nanban, which I also was a big fan of. What made this dish so good was the tartar on top which had such a rich, creamy flavor. The chicken also was cooked with sweet and sour sauce which combined with the tartar was an ultimate end to my night. The service was also terrific given all these dishes were so freshly prepped and served at such a late hour. I did have to go in a couple times for a few requests as it was taking longer than expected, but other than that no issues. Would definitely stop by here again if I'm in East Village..We were craving good fried chicken last night around 1AM, but wanted to sit down and dine in in a more quiet environment that also had beer.. it seemed like we were asking for too much because what can you really get at that time? Well, after extensively yelping around, and going to numerous places that were either closed or too busy, we took a chance on Ichibantei.Despite it being on the corner of 13th and 1st Ave, they were pretty lowkey that we almost missed it. The outdoor dining area was kinda tight but somehow the way they built it, it made it feel really intimate and quiet even though reggae covers of popular songs played on the speakers! Which was such a vibe~We ordered the potato salad, chicken nanban and garlic chicken. This was already way too much food for us considering how filling everything was! Each entree came with a salad, rice and a miso soup as well. And you get quiet a generous portion, for a reasonable price.Potato Salad - The flavor was really good and I surprisingly enjoyed the little strips of onion pieces in it.Chicken Nanban - This is their signature dish apparently. It is a sweet and sour chicken with a tartar sauce on top. The sweet and sour flavor was not overwhelming and I loved that it wasn't so sweet at all. This was a clear winner for me!Garlic Chicken - This is a fried chicken with a type of gravy sauce poured over top? I wasn't sure what that was but I didn't taste much of the garlic flavor either. I didn't enjoy this one as much as the chicken nanban. Nonetheless, it is still pretty good. I wish the chicken was a bit more crispy though! The staff was incredibly welcoming and friendly!TLDR: If you're craving good fried chicken (Japanese fried chicken!) late night in an intimate setting away from rowdy drunk people, go to Ichibantei!.This ""Japanese soul food"" restaurant will do in a pinch, particularly late at night when this is one of the few restaurants whose kitchens close past midnight. We plopped down on one of their outdoor benches recently and were served right away. Their succinct menu of donburi bowls and noodle dishes was easy for me to choose from as there were only a couple of veggie friendly items, and I gladly gulped down my cold ramen, which was full of flavor and cucumbers, seasoned soft boiled egg, and seaweed in a light broth.Nice enough for an on the go meal, not one where you'd expect to have a breadth of options and luxuriate for too long..Super satisfying late night meal! Had a late night and wasn't really in the mood for pizza or any typical late night fare. Found Ichibantei on accident and I'm glad I did. Fast service, good quality meat (had the katsudon), and flavorful food. What else could you really ask for?.I ordered 4 things from this place for my family lunch. I wanted to give a more favourable review considering the times we're in, but the agedashi tofu shocked me. It's 7 bucks I believe, and there were 2 small pieces in the takeout box. The portion size is ridiculous... The entrees ($18 each) are normal sizes. Btw, the prices on their website are not up to date..We order here for delivery all the time and supported their business throughout the pandemic. Today, I stopped here to pick up a takeout to go since we were craving for their karaage and ginger pork. We had already eaten dinner at a restaurant nearby but decided to get to take home for a late night snack. I ordered through Uber eats and when I came to pick up the food. Mind you the restaurant wasn't busy at all. The owner asked for my name and I told him. He checked and came back and told me I didn't order here. I showed him my order and still, he ignored me and said we don't have your order. Finally another waiter then checked again and gave me my order right away. I showed the owner the bag with my order as I was leaving, he was rushing to bring food to a table and gave me a look as in move out of his way or might of even said move. Honestly I never expected to be treated this way as especially treated as a returning customer. The owners wife is very nice and helped us another time when we had a issue with a delivery. Perhaps she should be working in the front of the restaurant and not himWe lost all our respect for this place and we will not be coming back again!"
"So this place used to be called 2 by 4. I'm glad they changed the name, because the whole reason, my friends and i went in was because the place is now called Titty Twisters.This place is nice, its got a small dance floor, a pool table and a little seating area. The bartenders are nice, but slow! This almost caused a little fight with the skank standing behind me who thought i was hogging the bartenders time. But really was just watching her take about 10 mins to make 3 mixed drinks and a Bud. They had pretty good music but slipped into fits of country music rage, that cleared of the dance floor rather quickly..I just called the number for this place and it's out of service.  I have a feeling this place is now closed.  I wonder, if anything, took its place??  I loved this place when it was 2 by 4.  I hope another good bar takes its place soon.  Please keep me posted if anyone has updates for this place."
"Reminds me of the (late) Red Rock Cafe. Come here if you need to get wasted or see wasted people. The $5 endless bud light cup till midnight was worthwhile, but seeing the same two wasted people climb up a ledge to play pretend strippers was...well...what it was. Until...one of them completely fell face first off the ledge. Stood up, shook herself off, and jumped right back up. Feel that appropriately describes the attitude of this bar. A love it or leave it kinda place..I was actually with Chantelle K. and experienced EVERYTHING she did so please read her review on this as it is SPOT ON. The only things I'd need to add are:-Girl walked into the bar not walking straight. Sat on bar stool and fell asleep for the rest of the evening.-Girl with shaved head dancing was scary.-Hula hoop was still the best part of the night..I do not drive a Harley or drink Bud from a can. Also, despite the fact that I am a woman and therefore possess the required T&A, I feel no need to display said goods in anything short, tight, fringed, or see-through. So, it's entirely possible that I wouldn't be welcomed back to 2 by 4.A poor man's Coyote Ugly indeed!.My friends offered me $50 to dance on the bar after the discussion about how I was probably the only person ever in 2 by 4 in a suit.  That's 25 PBRs people.Alas, I could not do it.This bar is ok, but a little too... dirty?  trashy?  I don't know, those are normally things I like....Two reasons for the bad ranking.First, this bar isn't going to be a dive bar much longer, and that makes me sad.Village Idiot - CLOSEDRed Rock West - CLOSEDYogi's - probably gone before the end of the yearI showed up here with some friends in town from Chicago after we had heard that a lot of Red Rock West bartenders were getting shifts here.  had some trouble finding the place at first because there was no bar on the corner of 2nd and 4th called 2 x 4.  Instead, there was a fancy new awning with AMBIANCE in big letters up above it.  Obviously, the owners are looking to change the place because a dive bar named Ambiance just doesn't work (unless maybe they put the word shitty in small letters in front of of it).The second and bigger problem happened when we finally realized Ambiance was 2 x 4 and walked in.  If I can cross reference my Red Rock West review, the bar only gets 4 stars because of:I don't know her name and I don't want to know her name.  But every time I go here, she seems to be bartending and she appears to make it her goal to ruin my night.  If you were hotter, I'd be cool with you pouring a shot of Jack into your mouth and spitting it into mine.  But you're not.  I'm also not so cool with a bartender refusing to give us our drinks unless I pay for them because she thinks my friend always pays, when that isn't true (I just never order from you because you frighten me).Well, guess who was bartending at 2 x 4 on a random Thursday night when I decided to show up?  What the f is this about?  Not only are all the good dive bars closing, but the ones that are staying open continue to employ people who want to spit jack daniels in my mouth.  Not cool.The crowd was non-existent and the person who put money in the jukebox thought playing Abba was a good idea.  I shan't be back..While I generally resist ending up here after cheap Indian food night at Sonar Gao (n? w?) I can't say that I've regretted it. Yes, it's maaad divey, but it is basically what you make of it [such is life]. If, for instance, you take over the jukebox and play The Cure, you might just have a good night. And you can't argue with $3 well drinks. They're watered down but whatevs. Yes, I'm strangely fond of this place....Reasons you should go to this bar:1.) Cheap beer.2.) you enjoy dive bars3.) friendly staff4.) yes, even the bouncers are friendly (unless you're a jerk)5.) people dance on the barand 6, and maybe the most likely reason you go to this bar:6.) if you remember the name, you know how to get there.Remember when you were in college and there was that frat dude who wore that white hat with the American flag on it?  Yes, THAT dude.  Well, this is where that dude hangs out at to gawk at girls.  And the girls who go there to gawk at, wow.  They all seem to dress like catholic school girls and dance on the bar wearing white socks.  Normally, that's kind of hot, but its just really REALLY sketchy in this place.  I honestly feel dirty that I set foot inside.  And its not the kind of dirty you can wash off either.  :-(.Such crap. If I had the ability to review this place with zero stars, I would. Its only redeeming quality was the fact that it holds a liquor license, and little else. To be quite honest, we only came here after I was trying to relate the story of visiting NYC years ago as a tourist and being dragged to a ""poor man's Coyote Ugly where a lesbian bartender hit on me hardcore"". Oh, nostalgia. My friends immediately recognized this as being 2 by 4 and so we absconded from KGB to head here.We really ought to have just remained where we were, in retrospect. The bartenders were trashy and rude, the regulars at the bar were assholes, and defended by the bartenders, the internet jukebox wasn't even turned on, so money was wasted on that, and then the fun cherry on top was when someone sneaked my friend's wallet from her coat pocket. The latter-- hey, that can happen anywhere. But we were kind of already waaaay over 2 by 4 and it was just that moment where you just go right over the edge into outright disgust and hatred of a place. But at least I found out where that crappy bar I visited 5 years ago was. No more wondering. Yay.*short version: Worst place everrr.Eh. Meh. This is bottom of the barrel. Which is exactly why some of my friends like it. I've had decent times here. A long time ago. Now I know better. At least they have PBR. but, yeah there's just not much to say. Its a square room, the bathroom probably shouldn't be used, and its the same boring classic rock (don't get me wrong, I love certain classic rock bands like AC/DC who kick everyone's ass at bars, but you can only play sweet home alabama so many times before you want to kill the remaining members of Skynard, even if they aren't touring) and classic rock posers (read: Jet) blasting through the stereo.Oh no women. Except the drunk ones behind the bar. And they do the whole dance on the bar thing, like in every other divey-almost roadhouse bar in the city. And its boring. Because most of them can't dance. And you have all those nasty old guys just drooling away."
"Been here a few times and I only had their lattes to go cause of the pandemic. They tasted pretty great and Their honey bee latte was my favorite. Today was my first time finally dining in because I just really enjoy my espresso drinks more when I sit down and have it. Maybe it's a visual thing but I'm a firm believer that you eat with your eyes first.So I came here with the intention to do some work on my laptop but they have this weird policy where you can't use your laptop cause it was a weekend day. I know some cafes do that and I'm not exactly sure what the reason is. They did say however that since it wasn't too busy that I could use it on the big shared table. Appreciated it but I needed an outlet since my laptop was dead so I just decided to have my drink and leave, which was unfortunate.Aside from that slight inconvenience, I enjoyed the rest of my experience. I ordered the coconut kiss, which is an espresso with half n half and coconut but in the size of a cortado. I was really craving a quality espresso drink and this satisfied it, which I was surprised cause I didn't expect this in my neighborhood. It was silky smooth (which was the type of drink I was really craving at the moment) with great tasting espresso and coconut working together. Coconut and espresso just work so well together.I'm definitely coming back. Probably not to do work on the weekends which was unfortunate cause I was hoping this could be a new addition to my list of study spots close to me. I'll try to see how it is on the weekdays I don't really like to be rushed when I'm studying at a cafe so let's see. But maybe to just enjoy a drink and chill or catch up with a friend. I consider this one of the best espresso in my neighborhood, but then again the options are limited. I'm glad this is here.This is not our first time here and definitely won't be our last . I am so grateful that this place is in our neighborhood . It reminds me of a European cafe . The atmosphere is lovely and the indoor and outdoor seating is really  comfortable  and clean .  We order wraps that are yummy  and healthy  and flavorful coffee. What also makes this place extra special is the staff .,The staff here is so, so friendly , efficient and helpful ! I have a few names of the wonderful , wonderful staff . Their names are Pearl, Sylvia and Irene .,They are treasures! There may also be others that I might have not mentioned . So happy that we got to be here today and will certainly be back soon ..My daughters told me  all about this lovely  cafe . They have come here many, many times.   It is a gem !  Everything is really good here ( coffee ,pastries etc ) including the staff . Silvia and Pearl are keepers !!.Hit and miss - as others have said.  Night staff Wednesday through Sunday MUCH more pleasant than other times. Worst aspect: Owner all too frequently blocks off the public bathroom.  And this is a place which serves beer and wine in addition to food and coffee..$11.50 + tax + tip for a large pretzel displayed along with the cookies and pastries. I was flabbergasted. Still in shock, I paid. Never again..Found this place during an afternoon walk with friends. Super cute on the outside with all the flowers, thats what caught my attention. I ordered the burrata on toast, it was like drizzled with olive oil and peppercorn? Delicious! Made fresh. Love thats a local small business and they're still open but a friendly, attentive service from the girl taking/bringing out the orders would be nice..$4.75 for a chocolate scone. That is tough. Coffee is meh . Nice atmosphere and ham and cheese croissant.. just always left wanting more...It's difficult to find a proper coffee here in Jackson height and I am glad Espresso 77 provides proper breakfast and coffee. For the coffee I would not say super impressed. It's good. As for the breakfast the seasoning is a bit light. And the veggie can be fresher. Overall taste is good and light. It's warm when served. The service is good..Espressos can be a hit or miss depending on whose behind the counter working. Certain food prices are ridiculously high, especially given the quality that you receive for the order. I give this place business because it is one of the few coffee shops in the neighborhood..Just a wonderful neighborhood establishment with a variety of great tasting treats and coffee. The staff are very friendly and their outdoor seating is the perfect place to catch a quick break during the day or meet a friend for a coffee. Living a block away, its become almost a daily stop..My boyfriend and I were super excited to find a café that wasn't Starbucks and had options with alternative milks in the area. Walked in, very cozy atmosphere. Unfortunately, service wasn't the best. We weren't greeted as we entered (and it was slow). The cashier/barista got an attitude because I changed the size of my coffee. I saw she picked up a small cup and I changed my mind and just wanted a bigger size. As I noticed the attitude, I said ""thank you for being so kind,"" she then smiled. I'm sure she noticed the attitude was not necessary at that point. Other than that coffee was good. High prices and pastries were cold."
"I used to come here more often when I lived closer, but now I usually stop here for a drink on my ride home whenever I get nearby Chinese!This BK has been here for years!  Longer than I can remember!It is a very nice location, its close to Queens Center Mall, but far enough that it can stand alone.I do not believe that I have ever been inside, I only remember ever using the DT.  The DT is hit and miss, with about 80% hit...  I do have some ""short/curt"" employees every so often, but they are friendly enough.On my most recent trip I got a sweet tea which was terrible!!!!  I cant describe it, but it did NOT taste like sweet tea... It was bitter, and not extra tea bitter, I sadly could not drink it.Burgers here are always solid, never really had any issue with them.  I also like their shakes and ice cream.  I am also a HUGE fan of their reeses and oreo pies!!!!!  Yummy!Id also avoid the Mozzarella sticks.  They aren't bad, but they aren't good....  And the marinara sauce that they give you is garbage...  Avoid!!!!Other than that, the DT entrance is in the back of the place.  It has a huge parking lot!  All in all it is a typical BK, if you are craving it, than this is the place for you!.Not only is this a poorly made version of Whataburger's patty melt, the order wasn't even correct. There was apparently a serious language barrier because the person taking my order, repeated it to me.I was given fries instead of onion rings. The burger had 2 burger patties, despite me telling her I only wanted one and she replied ""it does not come with 2;"" how does she not know what their products consist of??Lastly, I ordered 2 of the patty melts and she apparently only entered one and the bread isn't even browned. They just rolled out this burger...has the potential to be as good as Whataburger but poor quality control seems to be their down fall. Next time, no drive thru. I will walk in and make sure the person is truly understanding what I'm saying instead of just repeating without having a clue what I'm saying.Update: return visit today and so it wasn't a fluke that they screw up the order. Literally, the second day that I order onion rings and was given French fries. Walked back in had them fix the order but don't like what seem like off behavior by cashier as he went to chat to person filling the order..Worst ""toys"" ever for the kids meal. Always cardboard toys. And they have a sign that says you can trade the toy for ice cream. However this location will not let you do the trade for the crappy ""toy"". So they should take off that sign..Indoor dining is back. Had stopped by to try their chocolate oreo shake, & saw people eating inside. The restaurant decorated a little with some balloons, & 'welcome back' signs. The shake was alright, I think it was their soft serve, & oreo cookies, hand spun. There may be other ingredients, but I didn't catch the whole process..People seem to judge fast food at a lower level; i prefer not to do that. As i live in the area, I've frequented this BK a handful of times. It's always clean. The workers are nice; they don't have that no expression zombie look i get at a lot of fast food establishments. When i dine here, I don't expect anything different from the good ole Whopper; one doesn't come in here expecting a sirloin burger. p.s.: the staff has always been kind, when I've asked for sauces..I ordered a standard whopper, only with no onions. Made it a large meal and it was for my boyfriend. He is allergic to onions. The order came with onions and it is almost as if I asked for extra onions because there was alot of onions. The woman who took my order got it on the receipt so there is no reason why my order should've been wrong. My boyfriend was able to take out the onions without issue but please make sure moving forward all orders line up with what is on the receipt. Allergic reactions are no joke and this was really upsetting..I went yesterday this horrible Burger King drive through location around 12.14am.  There was a worst n SUPER RUDE lady who took my order she had worst n RUDE attitude while taking my order. I was adding stuff in my meal she didn't had patience n on that she was saying OH my god n how much more stuff. I told her what's your problem we need more food to order so she didn't had patience and told me u gonna eat all this. I told her what's your problem if eat or throw we r paying u. What kind of problem that lady had. I wish I knew her name. I would had write it her name also.. ridiculous person she was n super worst attitude she had. Never ever going back..Just look at the big, juicy Whopper won't ya? It did not disappoint.I really wanted a whopper after my workout so I walked all of 30 seconds over to BK and got my craving fix since it fits my macro. Ordered ahead of time on the app and my order was ready by the time I got there!There's outdoor seating if you want to sit down for your bite but you have to do takeout otherwise..This Burger King has been here forever and has a decent sized parking lot here. Right now they only have the drive thru open and you can also pick up orders to go as well. The drive thru is pretty painless and you can also order via their app and just let them know your order number when you get to the window. The staff here are nice and polite and they seem to handle being busy pretty well. I like BK a little more than the other fast food burger joints. They also have an Impossible burger which is pretty good..BEWARE! Watch your car. The management are a bunch of scam artists. They've partnered with a grifter towing service. While you're inside they tow your car. It'll cost $350 to get your car back. If they have it on the hook, they want $125 to take it off.There are too many other reputable places to eat in the neighborhood. Stay away. I watched them steal from a woman with a baby. She was in tears. This Burger King is a total scumbag operation..If I could give it zero stars I would.I would not leave a bad review during a Pandemic, but the experience was sooo bad that it is inevitable. I know that the standards are not high for a fast food restaurant, but I would not recommend this place to anyone. Do yourself a favor and go to Starbucks around the corner instead. Anywhere but here."
"I brought my family here after their arrival from JFK and in need of a hearty breakfast that was quick from the airport while being on the way home. It's safe to say they enjoyed their meals and even wanted to keep it in mind in the future. I come here myself all the time. I enjoy their waffles and paninis. They have a lot to choose from and I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu. They even have a good variety on fries. Straight cut, curly, and waffle fries..Great place. It used to be our family favorite diner. Brand newly renovated. Very clean. Food is good. We had Mexican Burger, chicken finders and tuna salad on toast. All yummy. Service fast n courteous. Great service is always appreciated. I will definitely come back..Very happy. Got delivery twice this week. Food got here still warm and within 30 minutes of my order. (They said delivery within an hour.)  Deluxe cheese burger was a little under cooked for MW but still very  good.  Large portion of food.  Great onion rings. Chocolate shake was delicious. They remembered all my special requests. Also ordered the Roast Chicken which was moist and had a nice flavor. Large portion of food. I especially love their stuffing. Yum!  Green beans were good and fresh.  The salad was pretty and large as well. Compliments to the chef!.One of my favorite places to get breakfast in my neighborhood. I usually get delivery, but they recently renovated so I decided to dine in. The decor was very nice. Service wise, the staff is super friendly and helpful if you need any suggestions. The food is awesome. I got the onion and green pepper omelette with bacon and toast. Washed it down with some coffee. I love their coffee. Just delicious. There are two other diners in the area that I've tried and the food isn't as good. This place has great food and everything is reasonably priced..Great food, nice to go in the afternoon during the week with your friend.  Weekends especially on Sunday it gets crowded, but that means the food is good. I would recommend..Had to rent an Airbnb after selling our house. Long day unpacking and we were starving for breakfast. Really nice diner and really good breakfast. You can usually never go wrong with diner breakfasts and this one won't disappoint. Also the portions were huge. Definitely worth the trip..Great service, lovely staff, fair prices, good food and hearty portions. I recently ordered an expensive meal and then realized I had no money & no credit card.... ""No worries... it happens...we hope you enjoyed your meal"" was the owner/managers kind response while trying to calm this mortified patron.  When I came back with the cash the next day the owner/manager told me it hadn't been necessary for me to make the trip over to pay him.  I insisted.  He finally took the offered cash and put it in the staff's tip jar.  A terrific local, independent business I will continue to support!.The old man who answers the phone always has an attitude I think it's dementia. The lady taking orders who's usually pleasant was just rude to me I think she got too comfortable. They always charge different prices sometimes almost $5 over the price on the menu. Usually fresh food but on my latest order the rice was hard like it was scraped from the bottom of the pot. Lack of consistency, poor customer service. I will not be back..Great food not too expensive would definitely recommend this place to eat at to all my friends and fellow yelpers.So they closed down during covid & used the time to redecorate and basically relaunch - I think they did a great job - I used to always come here as a kid and now after only being able to order out during covid and coming back after their remodeling I just feel like it got that much better! The service is great, I felt very welcomed & the food was very good!"
"Title for this post: Finger-licking good!HIS Chicken with garlic sauce and Pork Fried Rice and an Egg Roll Combo.My Broccoli with garlic sauce over rice. (Note to all: No brown rice!)The mood for Chinese take-out came about tonight and I searched for the nearest place for it. The name really serves its justice. It tastes more like a Hong Kong Chinese quality restaurant rather than a Chinese fast food joint. I'm surprised. I guess I found the right place! The broccoli is cooked just right with some softness along with some crunch in each bite. The chicken is also cooked perfectly with such tenderness. What I really, really, really like is their garlic sauce, which actually has some spiciness unlike some other places, and they give so much sauce, like my broccoli was totally drenched in the garlic sauce! Ok, it's not a like but a LOVE! I absolutely love to eat my food with garlic sauce and they really made me fall in love with their special garlic sauce. Yummilicious for real and I can order anything with their garlic sauce on any given day! Ok enough with the garlic sauce haha did I mention their pork fried rice is out of this world! It has what us Chinese people call it ""wok hay"", meaning the fried rice is cooked very well in the wok that it has this distinguish superb taste that can only be produced using a wok. Another like! My husband really likes the egg roll, thin crust and crispy all the way! We both like this place a lot based on their food and we canNOT lie!.Great food, and price and quantity is very reasonable. Taste is the best amongst all Chinese takeouts in Jamaica, believe it or not! I have tried many,  but theirs has the best taste. It's my go to Chinese food place, you won't regret. I love their chicken with mixed vegetables, orange chicken and general tso chicken most, with chicken fried rice. Lo mein is also good, one thing I would suggest is don't try their French fries, it's no good! Everything else is great!.This is by far the best Chinese restaurant in Jamaica. It's run by a family and the chef is the father. On multiple occasions I have noticed he delivers and cooks, same time. Try it out, you will not regret it..I honestly don't see any dishes that resembles ""Hong Kong"" ? It's just your typical Asian fast food Restaurant. But you do get an awesome calendar!.Local Chinese spot in my neighborhood and My family has been ordering from here for over 10+ years. Never had an issue. Food is tasty! Delivery guy is pleasant. Food is always delivered in 15 minutes or less and steaming hot..Greasy, greasy, greasy Americanized Chinese food. Got an order of Cashew Chicken with an egg roll delivered yesterday. Delivery was fast enough, but the food was a disappointment. The egg roll was literally dripping oil, and the cashew chicken was fried. Chunks of diced fried chicken. Ugh. I've never had it that way before, and I won't have it that way again.......I love this place!! I use to order from Jade Garden but lately they have been rude and the food isn't worth their attitude so I went in search of a new place and boy am I glad. This place is so fresh and even though the delivery guy had a hard time finding my house he didn't give up and amazingly my food was piping hot during the snow storm. This is the best Chinese in the area hands down!! Big portions and lots of flavor. Fresh vegis in the food makes me feel healthy without feeling greasy and guilty afterwards. Delicious!.Ive grown up in this Neighborhood and come to realize that this Chinese food store does not care about its customers at all. The food maybe good but there bad business practices are are even or disturbing. For example: I ordered ""barbecue""spareribs and they wanted to charge me a dollar more for ""barbecue sauce"" what? Get the F^*k out of here..This is by far the best Chinese food restaurant in town! Been ordering this take out for over 10 years still amazing!!.We order many times from this place because it is convenient and food is not bad. However, the girl that takes the orders tend to ""forget"" to include the hot oil sauce which we like to eat with the food. At least 6 out of 10 times, even though we stress on ""don't forget the hot oil"" many times. So looks like she is doing on purpose, so as to save on providing the hot oil. And when we called back to complain, she just brushes off with ""we're busy right now, cannot come back"". Rude and nasty. That's it. No more ordering from Hong Kong!"
"Very good pizza!We are in town for a few months and ordered a pizza and antipasto salad for takeout. We were very happy with both; our pizza was an eggplant pizza, which we both liked. Nice thin crust, perfectly cooked, plenty of breaded eggplant as a topping. Our salad was good, too. I would consider a 5-star rating, but there were 2 issues - first, when my wife called our order in they struggled to understand her despite her being pretty clear: and second, they only take cash. This wasn't a problem for us, but we often don't carry cash and it would have been nice to know that in advance. We know it now and we really liked the pizza, so we are likely to try it again despite the issues we had. They had nothing to do with food or service. Just little irritations..I'm fresh off of a long flight and very hungry! Went to Uber eats and this place had great reviews. My chicken Parm came with some piece of metal in it and I'm very shocked and pissed. If you decide to order from here be aware and check your food!.I have to admit, La Bona Pizza & Pasta is rather darn cool. Sooooo good and well priced. Every single thing I have ever bought here has been fresh and tastes great. All of the staff are really pleasant - you certainly feel welcome and looked after. Get there!.Update & upping  their rating; their pasta & sauces are off the chain delicious !!!Just tried their Pesto Sauce over fettuccine !!!Chow Bello !!!Thanks, La Bona !!!.Update & upping  their rating; we ordered their Chicken Marsala Pizza Pie the other day and it was off the chain delicious ......Thanks, La Bona !!!.Well we finally gave this pizza shop a shot; Super Bowl Sunday 2018; we ordered a large cheese pie half with sausage n half with meatball; delivered as promised in less then 35 minutes and I think was a great price $18.00 well worth it !!!The sauce was definitely homemade n cooked, the muzz was top quality and the pie crust was on the money a little crispy not doughy or chewy !!!This is one of the only pizza shops in our hood that's open late on a Sunday night till 10:pm !!!!We would have gave them Four Stars however we had 1 complaint; whoever cut the pie up cut three slices into party slices !!! We had company and this didn't look right to our guests !!!We were a little embarrassed!!! Whoever cut the pie up should have just cut the entire pie into party slices ounce the mistake was made and it wouldn't have been a big deal !!!Will definitely order again.....This is how my food was delivered and they refused to offer a refund. Poor customer service. I pray a legion of locusts upon their business.Quick delivery and good pizza! We ordered the grandma pizza on a lazy Sunday and the delivery was right on time. Usually our pizza from other restaurants arrive in terrible condition, but this arrived perfect and tasted great! Will order from here again.I was a bit concerned about this spot - had mixed reviews and sometimes neighborhood pizza restaurants can be iffy. But we really enjoyed our chicken, sausage, peppers and onions pie. Minus one point because it took over an hour to come, and they forgot my ranch. However, we'll definitely order again!.The owner and his wife do not give a shit about their guests, the food quality is never that great (I've tried everything from quick, already sliced pizza to sphaghetti in tomato sauce ) and it is over priced. I've ordered here more than 10 times trying to figure this place out but never again. This time I ordered delivery and they gave me a BAKED broccoli and pasta dish sitting in a puddle of water. When I drove up there and showed the owner what I received, he said it was just sauce....since when is starchy pasta water sauce sir? Then he  agreed to change it but instead gave me back the same exact cold dish but added tomato water to it. So more water....I was done. This is an honest review and I'm sure others will confirm my experience..Id like to have tried the pizza but your online order (beyondmenu.com) mobile website was programmed by chimps. Cannot add address because your cross street feature won't accept text or let me proceed. The next step is to add my city, it's grayed out because the cross street text box, won't let me proceed, won't accept my cross street. Total dub but it's whatever. By the way I only live a block from the pizza shop I'm not sure a cross street was even needed..The big ziti veryyyyyy good and the prices are not crazy. The food always gets delivered very fast and I always recieve what I order"
"Overall very relaxed place. Staff was nice and I really enjoyed the food. I got the vegetable entree which was sooo good. Perfect amount and the flavor was excellent. I would highly recommend. My husband liked the marinara pizza - he said it was light. I would come back if I was in the area. In our case we came across while waiting for an appointment. I know there are a few around the city so definitely will note that this is a great option..I came here for the first time around when outdoor dining was initiated. At the time the outdoor setup wasn't great and there was no blocked off space - it was just tables on the sidewalk. The setup now sounds better compared to then. There was quite a lot of ppl and I noticed a lot of reserved tables for dinner so it's probably best to make a reservation on OpenTable beforehand. I stopped by for a late lunch but wasn't too hungry - shared the Margherita pizza and it was so good! Enough to keep me full as well. I'm not a fan of olives but I just took them off. The menu has a lot of options and everything sounded really good especially the pasta selection. They also have a great wine list. I want to come back and eat inside because it looks really cute and cozy..This is the first time I come to this place with three other friends. The interior is so cozy and chic. The place is cozy and snug. We ordered meatballs and margherita pizza. Everything looked so good and came out fairly quickly. The meatballs were okay ,5/10, but we ate them all and they were still good. The pizza was sooo good. We wanted to order another but we had entrees coming. We ordered ravioli a la salvia , steak and fries, and the house burger. The ravioli was great, 8/10, it had a buttery sauce filled with spinach and ricotta cheese. The burger was delicious. The fries that came with the steaks and burger were amazing. Great classic fries. The cappuccino was amazing. It was so creamy and delicious..Really cute place and great service. Giving 3 stars bc it was the saltiest food I've had in a long time. Also the brussel sprout salad was more like guacamole.. would be good with some chips though!.This place is a good choice if you're looking for some comfort food. My friend and I came here with my twin goddaughters who are 5 years old. They had crayons and a worksheet to keep the kids busy during dinner so I would classify this place is kid friendly especially since the staff was patient with them the entire timeWe had a reservation but would've probably been able to walk in as it wasn't very busy for a Sunday afternoon. Could've been due to the rain though. This place also has indoor and outdoor seating. I ordered the cacio e pepe & my friend ordered the penne alla' arrabbiata. The food wasn't top 5 for me but it definitely hit the spot. I wasn't a big fan of the bruschetta that I ordered I felt like it was heavy on the tomatoes and the bread was a bit soggy. The graffiti that customers have left behind on the bathroom walls is pretty inappropriate for any child who can read so be wary of that. The wait staff was friendly enough but we did have to remind them a couple times of certain things we requested such as Parmesan cheese extra ketchup etc.I will definitely return to this restaurant I was in the area craving some Italian food and most likely for happy hour because the options that they had looked promising.Came here for Valentine's Day!!! Their menu had so much variety in the options but I decided to get the spaghetti squash vegetarian dish with a side of Brussels so it was delisted. I came here with a group of 6 and everyone ordered pasta and was obsessed and struggling to decide what to order. We are tried a little bit of everyone's food and YUM! 10/10 for the ambiance and over all service. We had a two hour time limit due to COVID which is understandable and we knew before we got there about this rule. My only complaint is that they added a 20 dollar COVID surcharge. Which at this point in the pandemic I think is a bit drastic. We are already supporting your business so they could choose to be closed vs making us spend more.... but like I kinda get it.The service was impeccable which made up for the service charge. It's a really cute small resturant in LES so definitely worth coming!.Stopped by on a Friday night with some friends for dinner. I was very impressed with their outdoor seating arrangement. They have a few different sections, all of it is very spaced out and done up very nicely. I almost forgot I was sitting outside to begin with. We ordered a bottle of wine to split between the three of us. Usually we wouldn't even think about that (wine lists in nyc are pricy!!) but individual glasses of wine are $12 each and the bottle was $42. I went with the risotto porcini for my dinner. I thought overall it was very tasty but the rice wasn't completely done. It probably needed a few more minutes to be perfect. But with the sauce and mushrooms, I would definitely order it again. My friends ordered the gnocchi di mamma and I can't remember what my other friend got but they finished everything in their plates..Serafina in LES is a cute little spot that has tons of outdoor seating. Their fresh bread stole the show. Super soft and delicious. Their spicy penna Alla vodka could be spicer but still good. Had an amazing Malbec to wash it down. There's happy hour of you arrive before 7.Super cute place. The pasta I ordered was AMAZING! A picture doesn't do justice to it. The tiramisu we ordered for dessert was also really good.Service was super fast and on point. We did have to show our vaccination card which made it so much safer.Will definitely have to visit again for sure!.Average pizza but good service. Very welcoming waitressesI ordered Napolitana pizza, the anchovies were dry and bony. (I really prefer when anchovies are added after pizza is baked). Nothing special about this place. Note that the bill comes already with 20% service."
"Great seeded semolina. Haven't had the cake's because they have a reputation for being much too sweet. Will definitely be back for the bread..When to this bakery this morning. I ask for cannolis and they had to stuff them. She reluctantly made them. I brought them to a family party and was mortified at the fact that the center was empty on every one.Unbelievable!!!!!!The cookies (put in a bag) were underwhelming.I'll give them credit on the bread! I will NOT be returning..My first time at this shoppe. I order a half pound of butter cookies and got a crumb strip. First off everything was very fresh and delicious. My main disappointment was the presentation. The girl just threw the cookies in the box. It just looks sloppy and careless.  I had also asked for mostly jelly cookies in the box as that is a fan favorite in my house. There were only 5 in the box and the rest were reg cookies. When I ask for mostly jelly I mean out of half pound box I want like 3-4 reg cookies and the rest jelly!!!  Maybe sometime in the future I will give this place a shot again..This place has been going steadily downhill for a while now.   Don't get me wrong,  the woman who owns the place has ALWAYS been rude but at least the pastry was good.   Now, that's not even true.  Three times in a row I've gotten stale, old leftover pastry.    This place is not cheap either, so you would expect top of the line stuff.   Not worth going to anymore.  Shoprite has better baked goods.P.S.  The girls behind the counter are either poorly trained or don't give a damn..It's amazing they are still open, the girls who work they have no clue what they are selling. They are more worried about gossip and their cell phones..I ordered a cake and a pie on 11/10/2021 to be picked up the day before thanksgiving 11/24/2021at 12 noon. Prior to ordering with the female Monique at the counter I asked that if I order now will I not have to wait on the long line that day to pick it up. Living near by I know that on thanksgiving eve and other major holidays the line is down the block by Walgreens. Monique told me yes and so I ordered the cakes and paid in full. I shop here very often and I enjoy their delicious treats. So today I went in to pick up my order and the line was all the way up by Walgreens so I enter the store and go to the counter and show my fully paid receipt to pick up my cakes and I was told rudely without reason that I'd have to wait on line. The lady wouldn't even listen to be. The stores manager Bella was. Wo requested who comes our just as rude and with a smirk on her face as she tells me to wait on line. Know mind you I do not object to the line I've waited on it many times it's that I was told by their employee that I did not have to if I ordered and paid then. Regardless waiting on one line is not reasonable in this store because some people are ordering then and some are picking up. Ordering takes much longer and there should be two lines. Any way I tell Bella that if I don't get my items id like a refund. She then offered to give me my money back and said good luck waiting on line at another bakery. I responded saying that I am a loyal customer and why would I lie. I explained that if I knew I had to wait in line I wouldn't have paid and ordered so far in advance id just get it fresh that day. Anyway after explaining that their employee told me that multiple times they gave me my order and I left very dissatisfied and disappointed in a local business that I spend so much money at. So shameful that young ride girls a ruining this good business. It's all over other reviews as well about how rude the young ladies are there..We ordered a cake a week and a half prior to a gender reveal party & when we showed up that morning to get the cake they didn't have it made. It was clear they had completely forgotten about it but they didn't seem to care and were not apologetic at all..I live in the neighborhood n frequent this bakery often. I asked if the girl at the counter (who I won't  mention her name , which I could) if she could add fruit on the top of the plain cheese cake. She said no. I said sometimes when I've come in before they have accommodated me. I asked to see the manager. She left for the day. It wasn't the no that upset me, it's the attitude. She represents the bakery and she is lucky to have a job. Lucky the business is opened when so many others have failed because of Covid ! Owners or managers  watch your business cause young rude counter people can destroy it..STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! I hate to put bad reviews but when you sale old and expired food  to my kids we have a serious problem.  Yesterday my wife went to this venue for the first time and purchased few small desserts, including the Napoleon, my kids favorite.When serving them I noticed a weird color in yellow cream, almost like dried up but I was stupid enough to let them eat it and took one for myself.  After my first bite I immediately noticed that the dough was soggy and stale. The cream was extremely bitter! I immediately stopped everyone from eating and put everything we purchased in the garbage.How dare this people sale old and spoiled food to the families of this community. People can get sick!I also called to let them know of the situation so they would take it out from their shelf but the owner wasn't  there according the lady I spoke and she was clearly not in the mood to hear me. We will NEVER come to this place again!.We had to stand in a long line just to get in the bakery but it was worth it there cheesecakes looked outstanding made me want more. Customer service was good they were very busy and had lots of people in line waiting to get in even after we stood in line for half an hour. That says a lot however what most impressed me where their prices. I could not get over how cheap they were and how great the products look."
"Food is always great. Never had an issues because the service is beyond professional. Food is always hot & ready when I'm walking in to pick up. So always very thankful for their speedy service. If you have a chance to sit in the booths make it very comfortable and homey. While your in BK swing by..My friends and I met here on a Saturday evening to have a simple meal and catch up. We finished our meal at around 9pm, paid the waiter who was lovely to us, and sat and chatted for another hour while finishing up our food and drinks. Our waiter had left for the evening and another waiter and the owner had arrived for the night shift. This new waiter hadn't cleared our plates or checked on us once during the hour that we spent there -- the owner had stopped at our table once to give us water. When we asked the waiter to give us water, he said ""okay"" with hesitation, looked at our table, walked away to give the only other patrons (who were White) water, then ignored us for a solid 15 mins. We asked for water again and he says ""well are you going to order something?"" to which we reply that we already had. His response was that he was too busy to give us water. We complained to the owner who apologized for his behavior and left. As we left, the waiter says ""have a great night!"".The racism that was seeping off of this waiter was palpable and incredibly traumatic for me and my 3 Black girlfriends. To be refused WATER after having spent money in an establishment is not what any of us thought we would be having to comfort each other over this evening..This evening, my friends (we are all Black women) and I decided to go to Neptune Diner II on Classon for dinner. All was well at first when we sat down, ordered our food, ate our food and also paid and tipped for our food... until we stayed a little longer because we were catching up (mind you, the place was EMPTY and closing wasn't for another hour. Plus they were still receiving delivery orders and a white couple came in 25 min before their closing time). I had asked for a glass of water and this guy (photo attached) said ok and left to get the water (I assumed)... 10 min passes by and I noticed he got water for the couple that just came in... so my friend asked him again for the water... he said ok and then started to act busy. This pissed us all off because 5 more min passed and he just would not bring me water. We asked for a third time for his response to be ""Do you guys plan on ordering anything?"" We then asked if that was the policy because nothing in their menu indicated that we can only have water if we are eating at the time. We ate a whole meal, paid and tipped... I wasn't asking for anything but a glass of tap water. If there was an issue, why not mention it when I first asked? Racism is real....So my friend got the churro French toast??? O M G!!!! Sooooo good!!! I got the Neptune omelet and it was amazing and huge!!! The home fries are really good too. Absolutely will return!.I ordered a meatball parm hero for delivery. I received a chicken parm hero. The fries were very soggy and unsalted. I hate chicken parm because it's always bland and flavorless. People act like they are scared of salt. Boiled chicken probably had more seasoning than this sandwich. I took a few bites and put it away. My stomach felt heavy. 5 hours later I was jolted out of my sleep from sharp stomach pains. I was extremely nauseous. It took me 2 hours to finally fall asleep. I had a feeling I shouldn't have ordered from here..It's a nice cozy traditional diner that offers way more than expected. We came in around 7 pm  craving breakfast and this place delivered. The 3 egg omelette was huge. It was a lot bigger than what I was expecting. It was cheesy and full of bite. A perfect diner omelette in my opinion. The homefries were well cooked. It's not too crispy and not too mushy. The pancakes were just as you'd expect it to be, nothing crazy extraordinary but just right..Love the food. Great service. Great atmosphere. Delicious food. Thanks. Stay blessed. Want to go back again.Part of our Franklin Avenue Shuttle suite!!There's another one. In like Astoria or something. The Great Neptune Diner is what they originally called it. Or, the Neptune Diner to End All Neptune Diners. Now, they call it Neptune Diner I.But we're talking about II. Right near the ol' Franklin Avenue Shuttle.It's open 24 hours! So you can have French toast at 7, 12, or 7 (a.m. or p.m. not discernible).On a typical Sunday morning, typically at 8 in the morning, you'll see that the place is typically empty. (Maybe the church crowd will cause it to fill up later? Does Brooklyn even have a church crowd? Typical.)The interior is lit with blue light shades, just like the real Neptune likes it!The menu was expansive, and diner-themed.There was a moment of decision: French toast a la Neptune, or crispy fried French toast stuffed with ice cream? I panicked. I picked the former.The French Toast a la Neptune. Just like the real Neptune likes it!A slightly different angle, accentuating the two (2) scrambled eggs. Tbh, they were good, but Neptune doesn't really like them that much.The baked green apple atop the French toast was sprinkled with cinnamon, and the baked nature of the apples made them soft, but their skins were acrisp. The golden raisins contained much flavor packed into their little bodies - even moreso than the apples. The French toast was expertly made. Not too soft. Just crispy enough. And check out that brown/yellow balance!Unfortunately, as in most diners, there was FAKE syrup!! So you gotta bring your own.If you become a devotee of the Neptune II, you should know a couple things. First, apparently they deliver.Second, their outdoor area is filled with charm.Third, they have boozy brunch options!Overall, the diner was a reliably reliable place. A fine choice with which to start our Franklin Avenue Shuttle Suite™With 10 as a must eat, this food-making establishment rates a 9.Pro Tip: BYO real maple syrup! (You should always be doing this, you pro!).Don't Miss: The crispy French toast stuffed with ice cream. Alas, we missed it!.Could not have gotten a better catering order for my covid friendly bday brunch. Eggs, omelettes, meats, and breads for 12 people.Food was hot and tasted amazing as always! Thank you Tommy and crew I always come here to dine in so it was my first choice when looking for catering..I stopped by this diner around 1AM (obviously the best time to be at any diner) and ordered my favorite meal- a Reuben sandwich. Out of the (probably) 100's of Reuben's I've eaten in my lifetime, this was was the most... mediocre. There was just something about the meat that was questionable, and had a texture that was actually making me question whether or not they've run out of pastrami and corned beef and substituted ham instead. I'm not sure what it was about it, it just reminded me too much of spam to enjoy it.The location itself was nice, and had plenty of booths for a late night hangout when everything else in the area had closed for the night. My friends I was with ordered eggs and bacon, which even at this time of the night came out pretty good, and all enjoyed their food."
"the pizza shop is my corner pizza shop. and boy does that make me one really mutherf*cking lucky guy.what else needs to be said?.Very good pizza. Especially given NYC standards. I miss this place, fond memories of the city..The Pizza Shop is like a good ""drunk"" friend to me.  A ""drunk"" friend is always there to hold your hair back as you pray to the porcelain gods after pissing it up a bit too hard during post-midterms weekend.  Or they are always there to fetch you Gatorade and a few advil for your hang over the next day.  The Pizza Shop is always there to serve me well made, crispy crusted pizza after a long night of boozing in the East Village.The interior is remarkably clean and so brightly lit and shiny that it's almost sobering.  It's a wonderful thing to drunkingly gaze over the offerings of pizza like a kid in a candy shop, turning back and forth trying to decide between the BBQ chicken or sausage and onion slices.  The service is quick, efficient, and polite (and it's sometimes really tough to be polite to a drunk person).The slices, while on the smallish side compared to other pizza places, have a wonderful crunch when you bite into them, but enough girth to give it a good chewy texture.  They're not overly generous with the amount of toppings, but I see this as a good thing, as it lets you actually taste the sauce and the crust.Like a good ""drunk"" friend, I know that the Pizza Shop will be there for me when I need it the most..My loyal standby whenever I am starving, lazy & can't figure out what  I want.A buffalo chicken slice usually does the trick.They are always watching cool videos of ACDC or listening to The Misfits & watching ESPN.Is there a secret watering hole inside?.Grabbed a slice from Niagara's new pizza parlour aptly named, the Pizza Shop. The place is brand spankin' new, spacious, and pretty white. I had a slice of their BBQ chicken... the crust was as thin and crispy as I'd expect from the piemaster who did time at Two Boots and Three of Cups, but it was a little burnt. Service was pleasant and fast. I'll be  visiting again soon when I have a pizza craving....I came here with a group of friends for dinner the other night. They had a good array of specialty slices like buffalo chicken and BBQ in addition to the more traditional pizza staples, but something compelled me to order a calzone.This calzone was unique to me in that it didn't have any sauce in it. The only filling it had was ricotta and what I think was mozzarella. They provide enough sauce on the side to satisfy the whole calzone, so I don't have any complaints about that.I had a pretty filling dinner for $5 at Pizza Shop. There aren't too many places left where you can do that....This place is fantastic!It's owned by the guys from the band The Turbo A.C'S, who are wonderfully friendly! The place is clean, toilets are clean, they have a wide variety of pizzas that you can buy by the slice or all of it, they have a big screen tv and classic sodas in bottles, they didn't have an alcohol licence when we went but were looking to get one. The Pizzas are delicious, they cater for vegans, veges and omnis.. and they aren't expensive $2-3 per slice or a whole pizza for $12-15. I had the slices of bbq chicken, olive and spinach and margharita. I could of eaten all night!.This has to be some of the best pizza I've had in NYC. Most New York pizza shops either don't put enough sauce on the pizza so its dry and not that good, or don't put enough toppings. Why should I pay extra for pepperoni when I basically got a slice of cheese???!! But the Pizza Shop hooks it up!!! The slice is delicious and there is enough sauce on the slice where you don't need to grab your coke so that you don't choke as the slice tries to go down and makes it tasty. Its slammed with enough topping which makes you feel that you really got a slice of something other than cheese.  If you don't feel that there is enough toppings on your slice, they will gladly put more on for you and give you no lip like some other place that refuse to do so (cheap bastards!).    The owner is also on site and is a really nice guy. I've met and spoken with him on a few occasions. I also love the rock music he plays off his MacBook Pro in the shop. If you're not in the mood for pizza, try the chicken penne which is one of the best I've had. The chicken isn't dry and its full of flavor. -Paul.Over here I've tried their plain, margherita and buffalo wings. I personally feel that the plain pizza has too much tomato sauce. I couldn't really enjoy the crust and the cheese because the sauce was too strong. Margherita had too much garlic in it. Buffalo wings honestly is just average. Plus, the pizzas are tiny!.I was on an epic East Village bar crawl for Valentine's Day last night, and my friend suggested we stop here for nourishment. Probably not a bad idea after seven hours of drinking. I took a picture of my slice, covered in buffalo wing sauce, bits of celery and blue cheese, and topped with chunks of delicious buffalo chicken, and sent it to a friend with the caption: ""I have tasted heaven. And it is spicy goodness.""Not that rowdy barhopping all over East Village and shouting anti-Cupid sentiments wasn't fun, but this slice really did make my night."

"Vampire bar? Definitely. There's some eerie dark vibes going on here.Based on the reviews, it seems like the only complaints this place is getting is being turned down for not fitting ""the vibe."" My friends and I got turned town to this place too... at first. After being denied entry, we naturally went to Lovers of Today, which is located right next door. Within an half hour, we were surprisingly were invited in by (I assume) the bar's manager. Strange? Yes. But my friends and I were eager to at least check out the bar we were so quickly denied entry to.The vibe is dark and intimate, yet spacious. I took notice in a lot of sacreligious paintings and gothic decor. They had an impressive drink menu, that is, if you're into $13 cocktails, and a full food menu. For being a weekend night, there surprisingly was plenty of room to sit. No one was there...We were obviously a little confused as to why we were denied, especially since the place was near empty. As confused as we were...we gradually began putting the pieces together. The place obviously wants to attract a certain ""vibe."" Maybe the same vibe this bar gives off. Dark and gothic, I'm assuming? Which leads us to question, maybe this is a place for Vampires only?.I'm so bewildered by the reviews of this place. I stumbled upon this bar when looking for additional seating at the bar next door (Lovers of Today) and was impressed by the more spacious rooms with a disco ball. Though it was a Saturday night around 11, there was plenty of room to sit. I'm not sure why the reviews are so horrible. It's a cool spot with cool music and intimate vibes. I'd definitely come back on a date. I didn't see the long blonde-haired bouncer that these reviews are talking about and the bouncer that was working there didn't even notice (or care?) that we were accidentally bringing in drinks from the bar next door when we thought it was an extension of the same place. I'm not sure if you can get here without going through Lovers of Today, but it's worth a stop..Tonight, I got to watch a good friend of mine getting randomly kicked out of this place for no reason while he was behaving completely normally. From what the staff told me latter on, one of their regular doorguys complained about not liking his vibe and decided to throw a fit because he didn't want him in there. This felt very random and me and my friends immediately closed our tabs and won't be returning. We understand velvet ropes but please get your act together if you're going to have such an agressive doorguy..What a ridiculous doorman ( long blond hair)  Came here with 5 people to meet our friends that were already inside. The doorman tells us we're going to need to spend 300 dollars minimum to go inside and that he has already told our friends that. When I asked them, it was completely empty inside and they heard no such thing and were told he might not even let us in based on his mood. Really? You're going to act like that ? What is this place ? Crazy door man, empty shitty place, other reviews seem to correlate with his attitude..I would happily give this bar 0 stars if that was an option on Yelp. Our experience this Saturday night was not only unprofessional, but insulting, rude, cruel and overall disrespectful. We arrived at the door for a private party that we were invite to by the host. Upon arrival, the doorman (long haired, blonde man) told us that he would not let us in even though we were on the invite list and the host came out to get us himself. When we asked why he wouldn't let us in, he looked at a female friend of mine and said ""I don't like her outfit. It's ugly. So I'm not letting you in. I reserve the right to reject anyone and I don't like how she looks"". He caused a beautiful young woman to question her looks, and ultimately hurt her self esteem and left her crying. Her outfit was well within the bar's dress code and it is unacceptable for a doorman to damage anyone's self esteem. Sister Midnight lost several customers last night, as we were arriving with over 10 people who will now never go to this bar again because of this bouncers disrespect. I highly recommend you think before giving this establishment any of your money..They were a mess the first time we went. Showed up to find the place closed, with unclear directions to a weird back entrance. We tried that and an employee came running over to us to say they weren't opening until late. We really wanted to try the burger, so we waited. Mistake, it turns out, as when they opened they let us know that their kitchen was closed. They've rectified this since, but come on - communicate clearly with your potential patrons.Second time, we dealt with, as others have mentioned, probably the single worst doorman I've encountered in NYC (which is saying something). He was disgusting and also shadily straight-up lied about our group meeting a minimum. My experience is keeping with a multitude of the other one-star reviews on here. You're a mediocre bar that was a thing back in 2011 when you attracted the East Village cool kids, but that time is over and, regardless, wouldn't excuse you for telling people they don't ""fit your vibe"" (because the best thing about NYC is its diversity and if you deny that you're, well...boring). I was a regular at Black Market back in the day, and if you were too - know that this is definitely not Black Market anymore. Hard pass..Cozy, dimly lit, warm vibes here...nice classic rock playing as I'm sitting by the bar sipping a beer waiting for a friend to go to dinner nearby.   I feel like I should be drinking something other than a beer as i sense they make a nice cocktail...a fine old fashioned perhaps.  Just a hunch.   I'll come back, I like it here..We had a private party there, all was fine until our friends were kicked out because (sic!) they were NOT smocking... they were even not allowed to retrieve their coatsThe fat and ugly bouncer has an inferiority issue and try to compensate by kicking people out...My advice: don't talk to stupid guys, it could educate them!.Came with my best friend tonight , the Bartender MiMi was so helpful and so funny this is the best rock n roll bar in town !! , I'll totally recommend it!.Amazing burger and cocktails!! Great Ambiance as well :)"
"Not my favourite, but I'm not sure why everyone is hating on this place so much.Yeah -- the East Village isn't what it used to be. But we're not young anymore. It's time to move on.Yes, it's overpriced. Yes, it's a smidge pretentious. Yes, the staff here is a bit obnoxious and blase.  Yes, most of the taps are stale af. Yes, you could literally walk a block over and find a better bar. BUT THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE RIGHT?I occasionally will pop in here because I'm too lazy to walk to a better bar, or all the better bars are full up. This place always has space -- but does seem to have regulars. I enjoy the food here. I've had hotdogs, shisto peppers, the chicken burger, and a beef burger All of it has been good -- but slightly overpriced.Do be sure to double check your bill because I have been charged double at least twice. Both times they were nice, but kind of annoying. Additional comment for COVID time -- They were very chill about our table of 5. The made a table for us and only made us order one meal. Which is cool. They seem like a bar that would make us all order something lol! All in all, only stop by if everything else is full. Not interesting enough to warrant an out of the way visit..""Super ripoff""Completely duplicitous and fraud on the drinks.  $4 extra shot became $16 with mezcal.  Attendant did not relay the price. Super sketchy.  I paid like $26 a drink for a frozen drink.  This is completely a joke with bad music.  I wish I could it a lower rating.  Please do not come here.My review:0Do not come here.  Zero.Tompkins square bar is my new local. The food is awesome and on the weekends they play great dance music. Louisa and Nolan are some of the nicest bartenders I've encountered in this neighborhood. 5/5 would recommend to anyone looking to have a great night out in the East village!.Best Service, Best Music. This is my favorite place for a drink! Levi and his crew make sure everyone is happy. This is the go-to spot for me and my friends and every time it's more perfect than the next..Love the weekend brunch - mango Bellini and omelette plus avocado toast is great.  Chill atmosphere, great music and a pool table in the back.  All you want in a weekend brunch and day drinking spot plus fun movies on tv.  OOOOOhh,  also the brownie ice cream Sunday is amazing !!!!!!.The antithesis of everything it once claimed to stand for... now (poorly) caters to the late night douchebaggery of the EV. It's blasphemous to have Strummer's mural on the side of this building considering how far these businesses have strayed from the punk rock ethos. Can't wait for it to change its name again next year..Really cool spot and enjoyed the vibe but be very careful with your bill here. The bartender manipulated my tip...i paid with credit card and gave a 20% tip(which was 8 dollars on my order) and checked my statement later and the bartender changed it to 25. So unbelievably unethical and disgusting I will never return to this bar.Absolute ripoff!! 9 dollars for a bacon egg and cheese on a bagel!! It was good just not 9 bucks good!!.Can I give less than 1 star? Was at the neighboring Lovers of Today Bar and a hostess from Thompkins Square Bar slammed a door into my husband. She was unapologetic and standoffish, leading to us being removed from the bar. The owner originally claimed we were being defensive, but after reviewing the video agreed we were right. Too bad that was after we were humiliating thrown out of the bar. Never returning. They also own Lovers of Today and Niagara. I hope they appreciate Tamara's work ethic more than the business of the 10 of us who were there today..Delicious burgers w fries for Twelve bucks.  Two bucks extra for bacon or avacado.   We wanted more of the fantastic fries.  Only one big table but several counters and small tables.   You can also order the food at Niagara next door."
"Vampire bar? Definitely. There's some eerie dark vibes going on here.Based on the reviews, it seems like the only complaints this place is getting is being turned down for not fitting ""the vibe."" My friends and I got turned town to this place too... at first. After being denied entry, we naturally went to Lovers of Today, which is located right next door. Within an half hour, we were surprisingly were invited in by (I assume) the bar's manager. Strange? Yes. But my friends and I were eager to at least check out the bar we were so quickly denied entry to.The vibe is dark and intimate, yet spacious. I took notice in a lot of sacreligious paintings and gothic decor. They had an impressive drink menu, that is, if you're into $13 cocktails, and a full food menu. For being a weekend night, there surprisingly was plenty of room to sit. No one was there...We were obviously a little confused as to why we were denied, especially since the place was near empty. As confused as we were...we gradually began putting the pieces together. The place obviously wants to attract a certain ""vibe."" Maybe the same vibe this bar gives off. Dark and gothic, I'm assuming? Which leads us to question, maybe this is a place for Vampires only?.I'm so bewildered by the reviews of this place. I stumbled upon this bar when looking for additional seating at the bar next door (Lovers of Today) and was impressed by the more spacious rooms with a disco ball. Though it was a Saturday night around 11, there was plenty of room to sit. I'm not sure why the reviews are so horrible. It's a cool spot with cool music and intimate vibes. I'd definitely come back on a date. I didn't see the long blonde-haired bouncer that these reviews are talking about and the bouncer that was working there didn't even notice (or care?) that we were accidentally bringing in drinks from the bar next door when we thought it was an extension of the same place. I'm not sure if you can get here without going through Lovers of Today, but it's worth a stop..Tonight, I got to watch a good friend of mine getting randomly kicked out of this place for no reason while he was behaving completely normally. From what the staff told me latter on, one of their regular doorguys complained about not liking his vibe and decided to throw a fit because he didn't want him in there. This felt very random and me and my friends immediately closed our tabs and won't be returning. We understand velvet ropes but please get your act together if you're going to have such an agressive doorguy..What a ridiculous doorman ( long blond hair)  Came here with 5 people to meet our friends that were already inside. The doorman tells us we're going to need to spend 300 dollars minimum to go inside and that he has already told our friends that. When I asked them, it was completely empty inside and they heard no such thing and were told he might not even let us in based on his mood. Really? You're going to act like that ? What is this place ? Crazy door man, empty shitty place, other reviews seem to correlate with his attitude..I would happily give this bar 0 stars if that was an option on Yelp. Our experience this Saturday night was not only unprofessional, but insulting, rude, cruel and overall disrespectful. We arrived at the door for a private party that we were invite to by the host. Upon arrival, the doorman (long haired, blonde man) told us that he would not let us in even though we were on the invite list and the host came out to get us himself. When we asked why he wouldn't let us in, he looked at a female friend of mine and said ""I don't like her outfit. It's ugly. So I'm not letting you in. I reserve the right to reject anyone and I don't like how she looks"". He caused a beautiful young woman to question her looks, and ultimately hurt her self esteem and left her crying. Her outfit was well within the bar's dress code and it is unacceptable for a doorman to damage anyone's self esteem. Sister Midnight lost several customers last night, as we were arriving with over 10 people who will now never go to this bar again because of this bouncers disrespect. I highly recommend you think before giving this establishment any of your money..They were a mess the first time we went. Showed up to find the place closed, with unclear directions to a weird back entrance. We tried that and an employee came running over to us to say they weren't opening until late. We really wanted to try the burger, so we waited. Mistake, it turns out, as when they opened they let us know that their kitchen was closed. They've rectified this since, but come on - communicate clearly with your potential patrons.Second time, we dealt with, as others have mentioned, probably the single worst doorman I've encountered in NYC (which is saying something). He was disgusting and also shadily straight-up lied about our group meeting a minimum. My experience is keeping with a multitude of the other one-star reviews on here. You're a mediocre bar that was a thing back in 2011 when you attracted the East Village cool kids, but that time is over and, regardless, wouldn't excuse you for telling people they don't ""fit your vibe"" (because the best thing about NYC is its diversity and if you deny that you're, well...boring). I was a regular at Black Market back in the day, and if you were too - know that this is definitely not Black Market anymore. Hard pass..Cozy, dimly lit, warm vibes here...nice classic rock playing as I'm sitting by the bar sipping a beer waiting for a friend to go to dinner nearby.   I feel like I should be drinking something other than a beer as i sense they make a nice cocktail...a fine old fashioned perhaps.  Just a hunch.   I'll come back, I like it here..We had a private party there, all was fine until our friends were kicked out because (sic!) they were NOT smocking... they were even not allowed to retrieve their coatsThe fat and ugly bouncer has an inferiority issue and try to compensate by kicking people out...My advice: don't talk to stupid guys, it could educate them!.Came with my best friend tonight , the Bartender MiMi was so helpful and so funny this is the best rock n roll bar in town !! , I'll totally recommend it!.Amazing burger and cocktails!! Great Ambiance as well :)"
"Chipotle, my faithful friend. There have been few times that i have been let down by a good ol' burrito bowl. This location was fast, friendly, and provided great portions and service even during the lunch rush. Was here twice in the past two days because i was so satisfied. i will probably visit another time before i leave..Cold food. Cheese does not even melt inside of a burrito. Spend your money elsewhere please. You deserve better.My mom and I have been on a Chipotle high for the past couple of weeks. Whenever she comes over she brings us take out from Chiptole. We both ordered burritos, one chicken and one carne asada. My carne asada burrito had white cilantro rice and my mom skipped out on the rice. She's not a fan of rice in her burrito.We asked for extra Chicken, extra Carne Asada, Queso, extra Corn Salsa, extra Shredded Cheese, extra Fajita Peppers, and guacamole. They screwed up our order and charged my mom for something she didn't actually receive..I've been to this location a few times. You cannot go here for an earlyish lunch between 11 and 12 because all the ingredient they put out are not fresh and looks like they've been pre-made awhile ago. You have to wait for them to change all them out around 12:30. Seriously not exaggerating, the guacamole was totally brown and hard on top. It looks like it was made the night before. When I asked, ""is that fresh, why is it brown?"" the girl laughed and didn't answer me. You can't be pre making guacamole like that. That's not appetizing or sanitary..I think everyone in the world can appreciate Chipotle, I surely can. Anyhow, I guess it's technically a ""Fast Food"" Mexican restaurant. They have Tacos, Burritos, Bowls, and Nachos. The standard for Mexican. My two conplaints are the extremely long línes during lunch time (Anytime between 1230 and 2PM) and how cheap they can be with rice and/or meat. I typically get a veggie bowl without the meat and they barely give any brown rice( Ask for the extra scoop and they will give it to you). On the few occassions I do get the Steak bowl, they give too much steak, Go FIgure! Although, I have many fríends who are Chiplote  enthusiasts who complain about the chicken portions they give.Overall, this place is great, fairly priced and I wish I could eat here daily, but Chiplote can also give you a heart attack when you have 50 people ahead of you during lunch hour and only an hour to eat!!.One of the hidden gems after a great workout out at Blink Murry Hill.  Not situated on a high volume Street like Third Avenue or 42nd so you won't be on line with a walk in customer off the street.   The chipotle customer at this location know exactly what they want and will not hold up the line because they are indecisive.   My only wish is that Chipotle closes at 11 pm oppose to 10 pm so I can have a longer workout.   This Chipotle was deep behind enemy lines and manages to stay afloat while the two Qdoba situated on a Main Avenue,  (52nd, 40th & 3rd),  with tremendous traffic like strollers to gridlock exposure still manages to fold.   I can't believe how strong the brand Chipotle has become..I walk in at 9:15 pm. As I get to the counter the girl doesn't even make eye contact. She just starts saying ""no black beans. No brown rice. No chicken for the night."" Then just continues to sigh when I decide I'm still gonna order from what they have. I'm not asking to make more. I'm just saying ok I'll still order form what you gave. Sorry that you're still open and available to serve a customer. Step it up yo!.I have witnessed many a terrible incident at a Chipotle. Once a woman screamed at the cashier for the unforgivable sin of putting guac directly onto her salad instead of on the side. Fisticuffs almost came to pass when an assembly-lineman accidentally used the tomatillo salsa instead of the fresh tomato salsa. A girl once asked for three extra helpings of fajita vegetables, thus leaving none for me. The problem with customizable Mexican fast food is that everyone thinks their combination is superior to all others when really ... you're just eating sour cream soup.This Chipotle is no different, though I imagine its location make the lunch lines pretty awful. The girl working the tortilla stand blinked at me when I made a split-second decision of skipping the rice for my burrito bowl (yes, I should have requested a salad, and yes, I messed up the precise order of How Things Are Done), but I'm giving extra points for that generous dollop of guac.Not going to say any errors that may have been committed by the people assembling my burrito bowl (er ... salad), because, well, it should be mandatory to work in a restaurant for at least a year, just so people know better than to scream at someone who makes their food..Service here is iffy but I mean who looks for customer service at Chipotle?  I don't know what the fuss is all about or why people love coming here.  Its over priced mexican street food.  I come here on occasion during lunch break at work but not my ideal lunch spot.Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad, its just bland.  Even when you add all the things on the side, its still begging for flavor.  Also its not exactly healthy either, watch when you add sour cream or guac, they will add a large soup spoon on top of it. Thats an added 1000 calories lol I will come here when there is no where else to eat but I rather go to Jackson heights and have some real mexican street vendor food than a commercialized over hyped over priced wanna be mexican spot..It's Chipotle!They've got burritos, tacos, warm chips, salsas, homemade guacamole, rice, and beans. They also sell beer and margaritas.The food for the most part is on point. Their meats (steak, chicken, pork) are always seasoned well. Once in a blue moon, their meats can be a bit overcooked. Everything on their menu is affordable.I know that there are many taco trucks and restaurants around us that offer cheaper tacos with more authenticity. But Chipotle is unique in its own way. So give it a whirl or two. This is my go to place when I can't make up my mind on what to eat. It also makes me feel at home, since my friends and I ate Chipotle at least once a week during our College years. Cheap Eats. Yes, please! Thanks Chipotle for being so close to my apt :)"
"Family run spot.  The food here is always good.The staff is very friendly. The breakfast plates and soups are especially good. When we get food to go the food is always packed well. Neighborhood gem..I had the Pizza Bagels, there were four but I forgot to take a picture before I started because I was starving. Pretty greasy, but it wasn't an issue for me. The sauce was tasty, and the cheese felt like the cheese off of a regular pizza. I will say the bagel wasn't crunchy, which is what I was expecting. Waiters were very polite and friendly, which was welcoming this morning. There are plastic barriers in between the booths where I sat, so if Covid is an issue for you, I recommend this place. Overall, very satisfied!.Sunday morning we wanted to get breakfast at a diner, so we decided to try out Townhouse Diner. Thankfully, when we went around 11 am, there were lots of tables open so we didn't have to wait. They had a wide selection of breakfast foods like wraps, sandwiches, omelettes, skillets, eggs, etc. I chose corned beef hash and eggs (I frequently order this at diners), which also came with a side of potatoes and toast.Food: I've tried lots of different variations of corned beef hash because I like to order this for breakfast at different restaurants I go to. I was very unimpressed with this one. It's probably my least favorite corned beef hash I've ever tried or close to the bottom of my list. The texture of the corned beef hash was very soft and mushy which I didn't like. I'm used to having corned beef hash that has potatoes mixed in with the corned beef and fried so there is some crunch to it. This just felt like blended up corned beef with potatoes added to the side. My friends got one of the breakfast sandwiches and really liked hers, so there are probably some menu items that are better options than the corned beef hash.Service: We were pleased with the quick and friendly service here, and we liked that we didn't have to wait for a table. By the time we had left, pretty much every table was now full, but they did have some outdoor dining tables still open.Price: This diner was a little more expensive than what I was expecting for the quality and setting of the diner. The corned beef hash was around $14, but I've had a lot better corned beef hash for cheaper. PS: I got the chocolate milk here which was sooo good!.The staff was friendly but that's where the experience ended. The food was mediocre. The chicken and waffles looked like air fryer frozen chicken nugget and a Bisquik waffle. At almost 20 dollars--this was a rip off. Abigail got the french toast which was better, but still seemed very expensive to other diners we've been to on 2nd ave. It tried to accomplish that traditional ny dinner vibe, but honestly it just looked dingey with outdated cheap decorations. In a pinch it's fine for mid dinner food, but in all honesty your times is best spent elsewhere..Local coffee shop/diner not far from the hotel.  We wanted something low key and this was the perfect place. The food was great. Breakfast all day was the deal that my son and I wanted.  The pancakes, extremely fluffy and absorbed the syrup and we gobbled it up.  My husband wanted the turkey dinner and it came with extra cranberry and he was pleased.  We were all happy with our meals and choices.  Service was great and happy to have stumbled on this place..Not sure why this place gets high reviews.  Kind of smelly and old, and not in a cool nostalgic way.  Tuna melt was just awful.  No flavor.  Very basic tuna salad.  I would never repeat.  Even with fries, $17 seemed like too much for what it was.  Waitress charged me $19, so I had to correct that.  I won't be back..Tuna on rye toast was dry and tasteless. Last time before that was a cold tasteless hamburger with soggy fry so I'm no longer ordering from them or ever going back. Also prices are ridiculous. Find an alternative any other place would be an improvement. What's so sad is that they use to be really good. What a shame..Typical NYC diner. Food ok. A bit pricey (but what isn't in Manhattan?). Waitress and manager were very nice..It. Feels. Like. Home. Ok u dopey program. It really really really feels like home.And u know what else?  I want,,,metal straws..Love the cozy, old New York diner feel to this place. Really friendly, welcoming and accommodating staff. 10/10 service and my egg white omelette was delicious. I grabbed a muffin at check out and the (what I think was ) owner gave it to me on the house, just so nice! Love diners and glad I've found one that feels so clean and staff and food so great."
"Exellent customer services.Finaly a chinese Rest. Where they speak CLEAR ENGLISH. EXellent Food.1 star because zero Is not an option. Chicken wings were soggy, rice taste like it was days old, I ordered seafood soup and got egg drop with seafood-- and it was not good. They advertise ""free delivery"" but when you call, they tell you they don't offer delivery. You would think at least the boba tea is good... but they fail miserably at this attempt. This is just not the place to get your Chinese food..AA Cajun Seafood is a nasty place to eat from. I have ordered from them before and the food was great. This time I placed a order of shrimps, dungeon crab and King leg crab. The seafood was old, smelled sour and looked rotten. I called the restaurant and the owner was not helpful at all. I called grubhub and got my money back minus the tax and tip. My order was 106.00 please beware of eating from this place..Extremely dry and doughy dumplings everything terrible you want in one. I already asked for a refund bc the whole thing is going going in the trash. Waste of money.Pay great tip every time for me to receive ugly dark triple fried wings. No one should ever receive this type of food especially something that paid for. I order here on the regular. Always did. Too tired to go in and order in person have to trust i will receive a decent meal after a long day and it was horrible. Their own workers wouldn't eat this.Pay great tip every time for me to receive ugly dark triple fried wings. No one should ever receive this type of food especially something that paid for. I order here on the regular. Always did. Too tired to go in and order in person have to trust i will receive a decent meal after a long day and it was horrible. The own workers wouldn't eat this..Horrible.  I odered chicken wings & French fries w bbq sauce & myth bf got wings and shrimps & they had the audacity o not put bbq  sauce !!!!!!!!!!! & SEND 2 DUCK SAUCESSSS !!!!!! Omgggh.Is this place even real? Had multiple fraudulent charges run through my GrubHub account at midnight on a Saturday. Buyer beware..Be aware !!! This restaurant lied about having delivery driver charged me $23 for food that never arrived placed an order said it would be delivered in 40-50 mins then all of sudden the tracker jumped to delivered in all of 15mins. Restaurant said they knew nothing and it only takes them 5mins to make lo mein, chicken wings and egg rolls. Very sketchy ! Might i add restaurant is over 20mins from my house so it's very unlikely after placing an order it's been cooked annnnnd delivered in 15mins. Do not order from here !!!.I dont want to even give this restaurant any stars, unfortunate how they do the urban communities....ordered this food and literally almost threw up...it was like 3pm and the food tasted 3days old....the chicken looked like it was refried 5x and boneless rib tips was so dry....and rice was clumpy and not cooked, now go downtown the best service you will ever get....close this place down only good thing about them is they take debit.What can I say. It's typical Bronx Chinese store setup. Indifferent customer service. No enthusiasm at all. The food is on the side of bland to overcooked. Take a pass on this place. You would enjoy a bag of chips with a juice more. If I could give no stars that would be more accurate."
"Excellent food. I ordered the chicharron mofongo. And oh boy, I really enjoyed the food Local:Is set up as a bar and it only has two tables that fit 2 people per. I believe in the bar it fits about 12 people. The food:Mofongo is a traditional Caribbean food from the puerile Rico or Dominican Republic. The mofongo came with a patato/meat stew which flavor was beyond this world. Definitely will come back when I am back in New York..I have to admit, Coma Bueno was truly superb. Flavorful menu items and outstanding service. Everything we purchased was superb and the menu itself was to die for. The customer service was fabulous and helpful. Certainly will come to Coma Bueno again..When I order they put u on hold for an hour they are very slow to take your order and I saw insect around the food they have old people working there that forget when tell them the order it's horrible!!! The food what's not good at all !!.Omg! Dominican breakfast to die for! Love this place. The mangy, longs USA and queso frito is everything..Very small location and no seating besides the counter. The food does not disappoint. It's authentic Dominican food and at a great price..Here for New Year's Eve and it felt like home. The music selection is great and it's really authentic Dominican food..This is a true hole in the wall. But the food is good, cheap and fresh and the service is friendly.They only deliver down to 100th Street (94th if it is a large enough order and they are not too busy). If they delivered to 90th they would get a lot of business from me!.The food is great, the atmosphere is interesting. This is such a great place to spend $10 on food, $20 on beer, and BS in the best broken Spanish you have. The people on both sides of the counter are friendly and accepting of gringos. I give the place 5 stars because after living in the slums of Honduras for two years, this place takes me back... KEEP THAT IN MIND..I've never been to the actual restaurant, but my father (Dominican) love love loves it here and has brought me their breakfast (mangu dish) or lunch dishes (oven roasted chicken, porkchops and of course...rice and beans) and it is all SO YUMMY. Authentic Dominican food. I can almost see my abuela in the back of the kitchen cooking up plate after plate of deliciousness. Go here. You won't be disappointed."
"My local watering hole and cocktail lounge. The decor is very gothic; almost vampiric ‍. The walls are red and there are mirrors everywhere to spot if you have a reflection .Besides that, the drinks are excellente. My favorite is a classic, Viexe Carre.Cheers.Ugh. I'm sorry to the people in the service industry who have to deal with people wanting to have full out conversations with them while they're making six to seven 9-ingredient cocktails. Add onto this the necessity of checking vaccination status and IDs at the door without burning a flatbread. Somehow, the bartenders here at Mosaic (even the tall ones) still manage to laugh at my lame banter, and because they are busy AF, I am pleased to report here that I've found other ways of entertaining myself at Mosaic. I'll list them in case anyone else needs a hand:1. Drinking my damn drink. I know--who would have guessed that this is key in enjoying myself at a bar?! It's quite fabulous.2. Getting to know other bar patrons. Sure, at times people want to be left alone (don't we all?), but one fabulous thing about the bar is that sometimes people are more than happy to chat, and if not, you can just go back to #1 and drink your drink! Win-win!3. Invite a friend who may be more inclined/morally obligated to talk to you. I know. This one shocked me as well, but it turns out that I do have friends who also like bars, and when we frequent them together, it's quite a nice time. Finally, to anyone following the saga of the other Yelp reviewer who had such a hard time talking to the bartender on  Thursday, Dec. 16th, I just want to point out that 1. The bar was closed that day. See pic for receipt. 2. The bartender didn't give this person the time of day but somehow managed to pour them a glass of wine? I'm pretty sure that's all he's obligated to do. Did I miss something? Mosaic, thank you for staying open and providing a lovely atmosphere to get drunk and have a nice time in. HIGHLY RECOMMEND..Super cool interior aesthetic with delicious drinks. Thankful for my local friend who brought me. And the Halloween accessories complemented the vibe so well. Cantaloupe moon was a sweet and fruity selection. The fig drink had a strong ginger beer taste. These will go for $13 - $14. The ambience was energetic on a weekday. Snag a couch spot if you can and enjoy..Wow - amazing cocktailBar in Astoria Great barGreat food menuTry the dates and mixed nutsAnd deviled eggs.Beautiful antique ambiance, mixologist approve , great variety of food and great customer service..I discovered this spot during quarantine when bars were doing to-go drinks. I would get mai-tais to bring to the park and oh my god I've never had such a great drink in a plastic solo cup. Since restaurants and bars have re-opened, I've been back a bunch of times and look forward to trying a new cocktail every time. It's a great place to venture out of your liquor comfort zone because every single drink is delicious. The staff is also super nice. Always have a great experience!!.One of my favorite bars in the neighborhood- the Dulce en Fuego is firee and the entire staff is super chill. Highly recommend!.The service was great, attentive and pleasant people. They have outdoor space and heaters, but i find the decor indoors to be vintage chic.  The cocktails are really good with many interesting choices. Wish more bar bites were available..We sat in their outdoor dining and had a few drinks. I had a glass of their rose to start. Their ones by the glass offering was a bit limited thought their beer and whiskey options were quite more varied. They had ten beers on Draper with a focus on craft. Lots of solid whiskeys as well. After the wine, I decided to halve a glass of the old Fitzgerald 14 year whiskey which was pricey but well worth it. Service was attentive. It's in a less busy part of Astoria so you're still close to a lot of stuff but don't have a significant amount of traffic passing by..The vibe and the mulled wine! Love this place xo"
"I am new to sake and the bartender was really great in helping my friend and I find something we like! I tried the mountain mist, and it was so good! I'm now realizing that a great sake tastes almost like a cocktail and the mountain mist did not disappoint, it was sweet and fruity and smooth. We tried some food too; I tried the miso soup, the tofu curry rice, the foil mushrooms and the veggie buns. If was to order again I would order the exact same, minus the curry rice. It was a bit too saucy for me, I would like more rice, less curry. The veggie bun was for sure my favorite, it was savory, crunchy, soft, spicy, just all things you want it to be..I love this bar. Lu is the coolest, the drinks are the best sakes, and it's the perfect date spot. I don't want anybody coming here as it is my precious neighborhood gem. Please stay away..I returned with a couple of friends for the atmosphere of this place, and it was one of the funnest nights I've had. Definitely go here on a date or with a few close friends, and then share a bottle of sake. You will not regret it for a second. I'm glad I came back..The food here was alright. The portions were sort of small, and the prices were typical of NYC. Honestly, two of these stars are coming from the absolutely immaculate vibes of this restaurant. There was a beautifully trendy and hip crowd, Pusha T and Jay Electronica were playing over the speakers, and the million sakes they had, each contributed to making this spot such a hit. Go for the sake and experience--the food can be secondary..Felt neglected since the place was busy and the table next to me had at least 3 dishes delivered before my curry was served. I guess folks have their priorities but sucks when I tried to cancel, they insisted it was almost ready (when it definitely wasn't).Unpleasant experience at this establishment. We waited 70 minutes for entrees to come and were seated on a curb. Food was good but wouldn't come here again..Um...not sure what happened this past weekend, but service was bad! It's a shame bc the food and sake were decent. Came here with several friends and had a corner table, ordered a few appetizers and a couple bottles of sake. We put our app orders in at two different times, and being a busy night, it took about 30 minutes for the first round to come out. The fried squid ""fries"" were really good, a little like jerky, really tasty and interesting. The kura-age was basically popcorn chicken, bite-sized morsels freshly fried and crispy. When it came to the pulled pork bao I ordered, after 30 minutes there was no sign of them. Understanding it was busy we asked the server and he said they were being made and kitchen was a bit behind. 10 minutes later no word. My friend goes to ask the server again and he says that the order isn't ready but then also adds that it wasn't the pork bao on order but the vegetable one. Huh?? When I placed the order, I especially repeated my order and had him repeat it back to me bc the table next to us was very loud...we ended up cancelling the order bc they couldn't provide an actual time when the food would be ready. Beyond annoyed bc I hadn't had dinner and was super hangry waiting for those bao to come..Ugh. The female working when I went was amazing, so it's hard for me to rate this place so low bc she was literally the best. So basically, this review has nothing to do with service and is all about the food.I spent $60 for food that just tasted like it was frozen and heated up. Nothing makes me more upset than spending good money on a sub-par meal, which I'm sure many people could relate to. I had different kinds of dumplings and shumai, and it honestly just tasted like store bought frozen food, which is such a let down. I don't recommend this place food wise, but it could be cool if you wanna do sake bombing and have some great servers that will most likely do one with you!.Delicious food, cool music, and a really fun and knowledgeable bartender/waitress named Lou. Very chill atmosphere with a great neighborhood vibe. Will definitely be going back soon..This would be a lovely divey neighborhood izakaya to hang out at if service wasn't so negligent during busy times. We came Saturday at 7 pm, and the bar was pretty much packed. Unfortunately, there was only one bartender/server and one chef. We ordered five different dishes which took nearly 3 hours to all come out. In fact, they forgot about our last two dishes and we needed to remind them about it. The bartender was also very inattentive and did not give us water, and we had to ask twice to be served water. And of course, it wasn't refilled quickly enough. But he was great at asking us if we wanted more sake.Foil baked mushrooms - pretty tasty with enoki and beech mushrooms. I was honestly expecting a more hearty mushroom like shiitake or maitake, but this was fine.tuna tataki - sesame crusted seared tuna, it was not bad.tuna don - this had the same sesame crusted tuna as the tuna tataki, as well as a tuna mayo mix. (For some reason, they forgot to serve us this dish even though the tuna was prepared in the exact same way. Stupid and inefficient and ridiculous.)korean style bbq - The lettuce was fresh, the meat was pretty tasty although rather hastily chopped, so some pieces were appropriately bite-sized but others were overly large.dried grilled squid - a unique dish that looked and tasted like squid french fries with a soy/chili mayo dipping sauce.The food was not bad, and the sake menu is extensive with very educational descriptions, but unfortunately they don't quite have their service shit together and I would not advise coming here during peak hours..Great bar with a huge offering of sake. We came in after hitting D&C and another sakes bar to grab a few more drinks and snacks. I went with the Demon Slayer which was dry, fruity and a bit citrusy and paired well with the shishito tempura and the dried grilled squid (which was absurdly good).Service was attentive and the prices were very good for the quality of the drinks and food..We came here just before 6pm on a Wednesday for drinks before dinner. They don't make reservations for parties of 2, but luckily there was plenty of room when we got there.// AtmosphereThis is a really cool spot. Very small, about 8-10 seats at the bar, and a few small tables along one wall. I can see how it would fill up quickly. Nice, laid-back, hipster vibe.// ServiceThe bartender was great - very friendly and accommodating. He taught us a few things about sake and gave us some good recommendations as well.// SakeWe tried 4 types of sake here. We first ordered two junmai: asabiraki suijin ""god of water"" and the kariho namahage junmai ""devil's mask"", both delicious but we both preferred the god of water and it's strong rice flavor. Next we had daiginjo: dewazakura oka ""cherry bouquet"" and koshi no kanbai sai ""blue river"". Again, both were delicious and worth getting, but we preferred the oka/cherry. // FoodWe were saving room for dinner so we only tried one dish, the tako wasa, which is octopus with wasabi. It was delicious and just what we were looking for - very flavorful but not too filling. I'd definitely get it again next time we come."
"Best CORTADO I have ever had!  It was so good, I had another!Nicest barista, working solo.    If I am in the neighborhood again I will stop in..Cute place, no indoor seating but a couple tables outdoors. Nice staff. Medium hot caramel latte with almond and medium hot chai with oat milk were good but came out to be 14-15$ which just seemed like a lot. Was an easy stop on our walk which is why we stopped. They're a bit busy around 10:30 but when we came back around 12 it wasn't at all! Would come back but not first stop. Appreciated the little latte art :).Dropped in for a quick caffeine pickup and in addition to good coffee we're baguettes. I had a mozzarella and tomato and basil on a baguette that they warmed to crispy tenderness. A capers salad on warm bread! Delicious!.Delicious, have bakery items and they even sell bracelets from a company called JJ Bouquet!.Kava Cafe is so outstanding, I wish I could hang here every day. The price is right. Each and every single thing that we purchased was incredibly fresh and yummy. Workers are incredibly helpful and service is really quick. It's a really nice place..Great breakfast wrap. I'm wondering if I can add bacon next time? Anyway pretty Affordable prices for the size. Definitely my new Sunday go spot..My family has been a patron for sometime but will not go again. Yesterday the owner refused to let me come in with my dogs (and literally chased us away) to get a coffee and snack to go! We have always done this on the way to dog park and yesterday he would not let us in but even worse was incredibly rude and did not offer to even bring the coffee and snack out until I complained that that is what he should have offered instead of chasing away business! I have always tried to support local businesses in NYC and was disgraced by his lack of appreciation for neighborhood customers. Such a shame!.Greta place! I've been having breakfast sandwich which is very delicious and they make it so good! The staff is very nice!!.Small place which is at the end of The High Line so convenient to stop for  a quick break before heading to other parts of the city. The coffee was fresh and the staff was friendly..We were here for a quick drink and a pit stop before getting on the high line for the high line opera event. The staff behind the bar was great, very friendly and helpful! And the juice delicious and the espresso/cortado great!"
Great Turkish/Mediterranean spot with a comfort food twist. Highly recommend the Mac and Fried Chicken Shish!.This is a hidden gem that should be on the travel channel and recommended highly. The food is so tasty and rich with flavor. Authentic New York experience. The burgers are fantastic and the Mac and cheese is so tasty(make sure you get an extra on to eat at home. Hold well to reheat in oven). Can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu. Everything looks so good.
"The pizza is delicious, and I definitely recommend it. This would be a 5-star review, but for some reason they don't open till 1pm. I can count 3 times in the past 2 weeks that my wife and I would've had a couple slices here for lunch but they weren't open yet. Most places that want reliable lunch business are open by 12, so this is pretty confusing.I'll gladly amend this review to 5 stars once they start opening at a reasonable time..That's some primo A1 crust for sure. Crispy with a little chew - it's got those little heat bumpies so you know the oven is well hot. This is a very solid New York City style slice. The sauce has a slight acidity to it and the cheese adds a very mild sweetness, draped thin and texturally very subtle...So we got Rosa's (best Margarita slice), Joe & John's (they got a new game changing oven), the hipster (and decent) neopolitan sourdough one nobody knows the name of, and now Mano's. Ridgewood is on the Map..New kid on the block, honestly great pizza - but doesn't realize where he just opened a shop.  From island opened during covid.  Inside is awkward, conversations are painful / uncomfortable.  Always empty, no music or even noise for that matter.  Feels like an alien exchange.  Enjoy the diversity of the block guys!  Has the potential to be a neighborhood institution - but missing the neighborhood feel as of now.   Writing this out of a place of hoping this is heard because your pizza is good, and it is clear you think it is too!!!  Just would be nice to not feel the frustration in the air vs the love you put into the pies.  Just don't think this will be around long unless some changes are made that doesn't  makes it feel like a lemonade stand.Also delivery is good for everyone!!.Very promising new pizzeria in an area that very much needs some good pizza.We went in near the end of the night, so there were some slices that had maybe been sitting out for awhile, but were still excellent, especially the classic round style. Definitely need to come back for a fresh pie, which could easily become a contender for a top slice in Queens. Bonus points too for playing Simpsons episodes on repeat..By far the best pizza in Ridgewood. Excellent quality dough and toppings. Much better than the other options in the neighborhood. Will definitely order again!.AMAZING!!! Pizza by the slice, great quality! Definitely stop by if your in the neighborhood, you won't be disappointed..So I stopped by here a few nights ago for a slice and I could hear the dude in the back complaining about how gentrification is ruining everything and how no one in the neighborhood knows good pizza. Well I came here and got a pepperoni slice and it came with one single soggy Oscar Meyer pepperoni on it.  So I moved the single pepperoni to the front corner of my slice so at least the first bite would slap. As soon as I bit in it tasted like I had just ate a pepperoni crayon made of shrimp. Sauced tasted like a red crayola crayons in an old shoebox with some clapped out Air Force ones with crusty hardened socks inside the af1's. Not coming back..I'm writing this review at 8am as I sit at my computer to begin my workday while inhaling a leftover pepperoni slice. Mano's pizza is without a doubt the best pizza i've had in my almost 10 years of living in New York. My fiancé is a native New Yorker and probably the biggest pizza critic you'll ever meet. I always roll my eyes everytime he tells me the pizza we are eating ""isn't as good as pizza in New York used to be.""The first time we had Mano's he said ""this is the way pizza in New York used to be,"" and as soon as I had a bite I got it. The toppings and flavor combos of their specialty pizzas are dynamite. But unlike other places, you don't even need a specialty slice to feel like you're eating a special slice of pizza. The plain slice and pepperoni slice are literally so on point. The dough is super light, the sauce is flavorful- I can't say enough good things. Super happy to have these guys in the neighborhood, and as my fiance said multiple times last night ""I'm never ordering another pie from anywhere other than Mano's again."".Amazing pizza. Amazing owner. If your looking for good pizza place look no further. New favorite pizza spot has the best upside down Sicilian slice I ever had..Decided to try this new place on a whim and hot dang was it great. Phenomenal plain slice. Good selection of specialities as well. Can't wait to try some of the other stuff they have to offer. Will report back."
"Y'aaaaaaaaalllllllll... As a crazy fan of rainbow cookies, this place LOW-KEY offers the best rainbow-cookie-cake I've encountered in all boroughs so far! Shoutout to @rainbowcookiequeen on Instagram for putting them on the map!The cake has that nostalgic almond flavor with raspberry jam layers. The cake colors and the ganache are beauuutifully dressed. The layers are perfectly proportional (thin, not too thick!) which lend to optimal enjoyment. For real: this shit is my jam.Martiniello's, you guys gotta showcase your desserts somehow. Your pizza is all that--those square slices have a great crispy+puffy crust! But don't hide those amazing desserts!Dude working there running the shop is super cool+nice too. Definitely looking forward to my next visit. Highly recommend coming through!.The food is nothing great and it's overpriced. It's really disappointing when a pizzeria doesn't know how to cook eggplant and this is one of them. The eggplant parm sub consisted of thin rubbery slices of eggplant that had a metallic flavor mixed with too much onion. I also got an expensive side of extremely basic mozzarella sticks. Besides the mediocre food, I plan to never order from them again because of the way they handle deliveries. The mozzarella sticks were in a paper container covered with tin foil that obviously didn't stay on. Everything was thrown in a plastic bag as well and they showed up 30 minutes early. While early is better than late, they didn't even call before ringing my bell..In this crazy time we live in, places that can deliver good food at a decent price and on time are rare.  Martinello's delivered, pun intended.  I ordered a pie through Grubhub and was quoted a delivery time just under an hour from the time I ordered.  The driver called me 15 minutes early and said he was leaving the pizza at my door.  It was hot and tasty.  The uneaten slices are in the freezer.  Full disclosure, the slices are thinner than I usually like, but these slices were quite good.  I will order from here again..Was ok when they first opened when Sara was there. Now she's gone I guess working at her other places. No selection when you walk in for a slice. Ordered a garlic pie and was charged $5 extra for a pie with garlic powder on it instead of fresh garlic. To bad because I really wanted this place to be good. Must be another place to launder money like the pizza joint that was there before. Shame on you Sara..The food is pretty good but last week the older delivery man blew his nose with his hand before grabbing my pizza box. I confronted him and he laughed said it was natural. I told him it's natural to use tissue to clean your nose and he laughed. I will not be ordering from them anymore..Delicious and fresh!best hot wings!Very clean place and very courteous staff. I recommend best place for authentic fresh Italian pizza...BRICK OVEN  You can't go wrong with a brick oven pizza! Hands down !!! #nomNomNom #yum.New people are running the place now and things are better but they still continue the old tradition of ""Out of Service"" bathroom. Come on, you are running a food business, give people a chance to poop if you get things wrong with the food..This place was fantastic when it first opened a few years back. Now it's a complete dump. There are no longer any employees there, just a very short and rude guy who owns the place. The place is pretty much empty the whole day. The owner sits on his behind and watches a small TV perched on top of the soda cabinet. There is nothing to buy there except for some extra thin and dry slices that have been sitting behind the display for a very long time. I see the owner often getting food from the Chinese place across the street, I guess he knows best how bad his stuff is and won't eat it himself. The bathroom has been ""out of service"" now for a few years. I don't know if it's really not operational or they are simply too lazy to clean it. I kept ordering pizza from them because I felt bad that the business was doing so poorly. I had to stop because the guy would put less and less cheese every time I ordered a pie, until one time he put almost no cheese at all. That was the final straw. I will never order from this place again. He thinks that the key to success in business is to rip off loyal customers. He runs the oven at a low temperature because there is little business which means underdone pizza for those who are unfortunate to order from them. I have no idea how this place is still open..Please be advised that these pictures are not of the current ownership in place. They are from the former owner and former pizzeria named Il gusto. Also in regards to the review written by Joseph Y The Martiniello family has been successfully in business for over 35 years. We've opened over 25 pizzerias all over New York mostly in the Queens and Brooklyn area since 1989 when Albert Martiniello , our father started it all. For Joseph to suggest that we are running a money laundering scam out of this pizzeria is totally assanine, disrespectful and a total defemation of character. For someone who does not know my family at all to say something so ignorant and so offensive is something that me and my family will personally not stand for! My father was an immigrant that came to this country with nothing and built a life for his family with blood,sweat and tears and I will not let this imbecile tarnish our reputation that we've worked so hard to establish! Since Yelp refuses to take the review down I felt obligated to tell our side of the story, because our reputation and our customers are more important to us then ANYTHING! And without our customers and their patronage we would be nothing!  Regards The Martiniello Family!.terribleguy stood there for a few minutes on the phone before we could order. then we ordered and he did nothing and went back on his phone. we were ready to pay and then we found out each slice was $3.50 !!! uhh no thanks i'll walk a few streets away to Rosa's - where they have some of the best pizza. do not recommend."
"Nice and cozy diner...  They have best homemade fries... Delicious smoothies... And blackbean burger was so fresh and flavourful. The hostess was very friendly and charming. Loved this place... If i could give more than 5stars....This place is under new management and they understand how important it is to make personal connections with their customers. I feel like I've been waited on hand and foot since coming through the door. Now after months in business--better than ever.Ordered some French toast a week or so ago as our first order from this place. Was perfectly decent and arrived in a good amount of time - just wasn't anything super special, but delivery French toast in this area is always going to be hit or miss. When walking by the place, it looks nice inside and clean but not super crowded. Wish them the best though!.Today I went for brunch at the newly opened The Stoop.My SO and I have been looking forward to the opening; when we were younger, we often went to The Stoop's predecessor, Lindo's, and we were excited to see that something with a bit more of a sophisticated menu was moving in.First of all, the fries are AMAZING. They were homemade, crispy, and fresh out of the fryer. This was by far the best part of the meal. I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for good fries.My SO had a spicy chicken panini with fries, and I had a brunch special. I got something called ""The Stoop"" which appeared to be a take on Eggs Benedict. Normally, I wouldn't order Hollandaise sauce from a restaurant, but it was the early morning and the waitress assured me that everything is made fresh in the morning. The brunch special came with BOTH a Mimosa and Coffee, which was nice. The coffee was good, better than I expect to get at a diner, and the mimosa was pretty nice, although it didn't seem very bubbly. My SO's panini looked and tasted quite good. It came with a sweet chili sauce on the side that was really nice. The chicken could have been a little nicer quality though. The Eggs Benedict dish (it was a toasted brioche bun with spinach, poached egg, and hollandaise with a side of hash browns) was disappointing. The hollandaise was flavorless (no tangy lemony and buttery flavor) and didn't seem to have the emulsified texture that hollandaise normally has. I would have liked the hashbrowns with more of a crisp on them.My advice to this new restaurant is this: focus on what you do well and sell just that. Those fries are AMAZING. ""The stoop"" brunch special I had was not. If you name a dish after your restaurant, you should make sure that dish shows the best of what your restaurant has to offer. I would rework ""The Stoop"" dish or take it off the brunch menu. A smaller menu where you know everything you're making is excellent is always the way to go. Last off, I liked the decor! It's understated and a little rustic, and I think it fits the neighborhood well. The mason jar glasses and water on the table was a nice touch; it has its own charm and I think its a cheap way for a new restaurant to look chic. I would definitely go to The Stoop again. Next time I want good fries, The Stoop will be on the short list..I came here to grab late lunch/dinner with my mom and her boyfriend since we live in the area, of course looking at reviews I see why it's favored! They recently just opened and let me say I think it's my new spot! I had the roadhouse burger ( American cheese, avocado, red onions and bacon!!!!!! ) which was honestly way too good. The nachos are my favorite, buffalo wings are okay and the blackjack burger is also another good one (cheddar cheese, caramelized onions). Definitely will be coming back here probably on a daily basis. Great service and staff as well!.Delicious! Delicious! Delicious!!!! All the food was great and the staff was so kind and warm! Try the zucchini the pesto sauce that came with it is to die for!.This is a take-out review. I ordered thru grub hub and the menu looked interesting. The nostalgia of Lindo's being there forever still lingers a bit but I digress. I ordered the burger which came with spiced fries and fried zucchini sticks. It arrived promptly and warm. The sticks were soggy , but I expected that due to the packaging. The grass fed hamburger was OK, nothing special as far as taste or anything that would make it stand out for me. I'll go in person and give it another try soon..I live two blocks from here and ordered from here for the first time.  My burger and fries were incredible!!  I had a Blackjack Burger on a Brioche Bun with Fresh-Cut Potato Fries.   Burger was cooked to perfection.  And the homemade fries were perfectly crispy.  I loved the spicy mayo that came with it.  I can't wait to have my husband try this place.  Welcome to the neighborhood.My wife and I ordered burgers from here and they were really good.   Delivery was fast and everything was cooked perfect.  I had the burger with carmelized onions and blue cheese and I would order it again..So sad...they caved to the masses. No more grilled calamari...no more special touches. Just another tiny diner trying to include everything on their menu that the big, Greek guys have. Exceptionality replaced by mediocrity..I can't believe I'm about to type this for what is tantamount to a glorified luncheonette...Best grilled calamari 'snack' plate. $9 for 6-7 huge perfectly grilled whole calamari with a choice of dipping sauces.  Boyfriend's burger and extra crispy fries were just fine. Super friendly service. Star deducted for frozen turkey burger."
"We called an order for pickup, which was easy and our food was delicious and a good value!We recently moved into the neighborhood and we were looking for some filling, not too expensive takeout. We were pleased that someone picked up the phone so that we could easily order directly from the restaurant.We ordered a mix of things and everything was very good. We both got sifrina vegetarian arepas. They were tasty and two for each of us  probably would have been plenty for dinner. It's not the fluffiest or crispest arepa I've ever had, but it was very good and the fillings were generous and tasty. My boyfriend got a wheat cheese empanada which I thought was tastier than my corn cheese empanada, which tasted kind of unexpectedly eggy. He also got a spinach pie empanada which had filling like a spanikopita, if you're into that, and I got a veggie taco which was tasty. It's very handy that this place is 24 hours and they have an extensive breakfast menu- I'll definitely be ordering again!.This is a review for the service only. Came here around midnight. Friends and I wanted to sit down and eat. There were 3 other people who had already ordered for takeout. Took about 5 minutes for us to be seated which is fine. Waiter promptly asked what we'd like to drink first which we told him. After he brought our drinks out, we told him we were ready to order. Twice. He ignored that and walked to the back counter instead - to do what, I'm not entirely sure but there was certainly a lot of swiping on his phone. We kept trying to wave to him several times. He looked up once and looked at us for a couple of seconds before putting his head back down. A couple came in and he walked back up to the front and we tried to flag him down again, only for him to give us the ""just a minute"" finger and he attended to the couple who walked in. At this point, we had had our drinks for a little over 20 minutes, so we decided that enough is enough. We left money on the table for the drinks and decided to leave. He finally came over to us as we were walking out the door to ask, ""Oh, you guys don't want to order first?"" All I could say was, ""we left money on the table for the drinks but you took too long playing with your phone rather than come over and take our orders so no thanks.""Honestly, it's kind of sad because we were looking forward to trying this place out based on the reviews about their food but the service was well below lackluster. How do you leave your customers sitting there just waiting for so long? To make matters worse, you attend to other customers who had literally just walked in rather than the group who had been sitting there waiting for almost 30 minutes in total. Absolutely disgraceful..So gonna go against the grain and review an empanada eatery over its churros.Came into this festivitus restaurantus looking for a dessert and settled on the churros with dipping chocolate. Our server could not be sweeter and our churros came out pretty quickly.These things were bomb. Crispy yet soft in the middle. Plenty of cinnamon sugar to keep it sweet. And the chocolate ganache was wonderfully creamy and rich. A perfect compliment. Really short review, I know. But if you need a sweet treat to compliment your empanadas, would definitely recommend the churros!.A friend told me about this place and I just had to try it with her. I don't get empanada often but I do love eating them when I find them. They have so many options for empanadas that it will make you go loco!! (Or loca!) we got like half the menu when we ordered, 2 of almost everything. The cheese one is really good and I think my favorite. (A bit inconsistent though because one time we got a little cheese and another time we got a lot.) The beer, pork and chicken are all good - but even better with the sauces that come with the empanadas. The mamacita crabmeat one is really just imitation crabmeat (fish cake basically) so just be forewarned before you order that one. I thought it would be real crabmeat and was a sad reality when I bit into it. Tip - don't get too many like we did because you will become too full too fast!.Ordered from here today via Caviar and it was a smart decision. I'm a fake vegan so I low key ordered a beef empanada and ate it in private. It was phenomenal. The flavor took me back to childhood. I see myself trying everything on the menu in the future..These empanadas are good but small.I bought 6 for $24.83.They give you 1 small sauce (1/2 filled)for every 2 empanadas. I asked to please have one small sauce  for each empanada. They said no -I have to spend $25.I then asked how much for more sauce they said .80 cents each.These people are overpriced and cheap. Never going back. Poor Management.Great find close by the Whole Foods where we do our weekly shopping.  Tried a variety of empanadas.  Preferred the chewy, corny crust to the wheat crust, but both were excellent.  Chicken in the corn crust was a little bland and dry.  Beef and pork with cheese were succulent.  Pink sauce is fiery hot - I prefer a green sauce, like Empanada Mama's.  Still, this could be a new craving for me.  The dining room is adorable and staff is friendly.  Sit down breakfast, like breakfast nachos, is another option....small place has cute little outdoor shack.I like how they have a lot of different options.I tried their seafood empanada and ifrst I was like man do I want to get food poisoning because reality is seafood is always hit or miss  BUT IT WAS BOOOMB.I also love their fries with sausage and all the sauces couldn't even finish because the portion was huge.They also make a very tasty ice cream sundae..10/10 service , food was delicious and environment is very friendly. Kind of sad they have no alcohol because they're open so late figured it would be the right thing lol. Chicken & beef empanadas a bit dry but overall the food is great. Prices aren't bad neither, def recommend..Yes! Open and it's delicious food with great service- you can't go wrong here!. We got theAndes empanadas- crispy crunchy stuffed wheat  pastry yumminess filled with chorizo and cheese... mmmmm yum!!! So good.My friend and I split the steak and eggs perfectly cooked medium - topped with chimichurri with an  English muffin on the side. This completed my night! If you are in the neighborhood and need food to fuel up before bedtime (yes it's open 24 hours- a total gem these days!) or are strolling by during the day, stop by you won't be disappointed!"
"this place is great for anytime of the week, the service was good, the waitresses their are very polite and funny. brought the family there and were seated quickly, the food arrived at a fashionably quick time and it was delicious, their prices are very reasonable for that area. i recommend this place whether your out with friends,gf/bf, or family excellent enviorment.excellent food, have been going to this diner for about a year now and has become my favorite local spot. food is excellent , the staff are very friendly and polite which is a plus they make you feel at home...their greek specialities are amazing, homemade spinach and cheese pies, mousaka which i had for the first time was terrific...they have a vary of combinations of breakfast, and healthy food also!!...im not sure what these other reviews are about discrediting this place maybe they had 1 bad expierence and never gave a try but i suggest this place for friends, couples, and family. =].Great Breakfast and waitress M-F mornings makes me feel like I'm family. She's the best! Update: this place has changed....no good....Lindo's is a weekend breakfast standard for me when I don't feel like having brunch with friends.  It's just a little hole in the wall diner and kind of reminds me of something you'd find in the suburbs.  I hide quietly in the corner with a crossword puzzle book, eating breakfast, sipping my coffee.  Sometimes they forget about me.  I guess I hide too quietly.  If I become louder starting next week, I may add a star..Avoid at all costs.I like greasy spoons but this one is a grade below..Upon my move to the nabe more than three years ago, I immediately became enamored with Lindo's. Total throwback diner vibe, fun and sassy staff, great standard diner fare (and more -- divine blueberry pancakes and French toast) coffee that couldn't be beat. Then, early this year, I passed it and saw that it randomly looked shuttered. Horrors. Stephanie wept.One day -- what's this? -- I see workers inside the gutted area. Interesting. But no clue if it was opening as something else.Then, one random March day, I see that Lindo's has risen from the ashes -- with totally snazzy, completely renovated insides. I assumed that it had a fancy-schmancy try-to-impress-'em menu too, so I went in to try. Nope. Same solid diner fare, no frills, ready to be there for you when you need the comfort food. I say amen..Well, what can I say,they renovated this place and it looks nice.The place was empty. The waitress,was nice, with brief blurts of friendliness.  But here come the con: 1.The food was expensive, and I've been coming to Lindos since I was a tot,and recession specials here don't exist.  It got two stars because of their super expensive pricing. Their food was not all that, it was just plain old mediocre ($4 dollars for blt sandwich) it was basic 2 white toast slices, with a tomato slice, mayo, and a miserable piece of crispy bacon,I've experience better quality food at Daisy's Diner Park Slope. Sorry Lindo's I wanted to like you guys, but times have changed, unfortunately for the worst..Eh.  The waiter was nice, the place was recently renovated.  But we should have known when, 8pm Saturday night, we were the only ones there. But we sat down anyhow.  Inexpensive and clean give this place two stars.  Food was exactly what you would expect: nothing fresh or interesting.  So many other choices that I don't understand why anyone would return..I've been here twice, and though it may have a snazzy appearance, it's still got a dirty diner mentality.  On my most recent, and last visit, I ordered a standard breakfast, eggs, toast, homefries.  The food itself was cooked fine, but there were pieces of steel scubbie for cleaning in my food.  When I pointed it out to the ladies behind the counter, they replaced my meal, said ""Sorry, the guy was cleaning""  and didn't comp my meal at all.  I have to wonder, if the bits of steel made it into my food, did the chemicals make it in also.  I don't know, because I'd lost my appetite..LOVE LOVE LOVE LINDO'S.....im never disappointed when i go there food is yummy and  big. Best pancakes i ever  had in park slope and the best part of all the waitresses are not stuck up park slope hipsters that act like there real New Yorkers and better then everyone else .THANK YOU GIRLS FOR ALWAYS BEING ONE OF THE BEST PARTS OF MY BREAKFAST BESIDES THE YUMMY COFFEE..I've been going to Lindo's for about 5 years. Before and after their big renovation.  The food is good and they're family friendly."
"The pizza is average, but the service is amazing. The owner made our pie fresh as he was closing up shop. He also offered to help a lady with two kids who grabbed the wrong purse. Not in this area often but would not hesitate stop in again if over on this side..As a lifelong Staten Island resident i've tasted every pizza on the face of the planet (well I never leave the island so this place is like a planet)  and All Star was by far the most horrible! Do my tastebuds deceive me? Nope! First off the guy working there was disrespectful to my wife and screamed at her over a BURNT GARLIC KNOT! Wowza. Second off the prices are OUTRAGEOUS...$102 for chicken parm pie and garlic knots?! is this a pizzeria or a fancy French restaurant?? i just wanted pizza not duck l'orange!.Horrible soggy wings when we asked for well done . Mozz sticks frozen tasting/clumped cheesePizza sourTiramisu served in a cup frozen Never again.Friend and I grabbed a slice of pizza before heading over to the theatre next door. FYI- $10.00 minimum for credit card charge :-) They also serve deep dish pizza, but I have to come back to check it out. They have Cartoon Network playing randomly in the background. I appreciate this place a lot.  the gentlemen at the oven are really nice and accommodating too..I'm putting All Star cafe and pizzeria located at 694 Arthur kill rd. Staten island ,N.Y on blast!  I've been a steady customer for years but last night I bought 2 cheese pies, one pepperoni pie and 3 two liter bottles of soda for 74 dollars.  I asked why what he charged me doesn't make sense with the menu prices available, he said they ran out of new menus and these were the new Covid prices.  Sure he lost a lot of business with the movie theater closing but he never had to close and was open for take out.I had no time to argue and was in a hurry but this is a clear case of price gauging .  Spread the word to all you know NOT to order from this guy.  I'm calling 311 on this guy and will post this in greattkills page on here as well.     Help me prevent you and other potential customers from getting ripped off!  Please share.   Thank you..came here after a movie at 7:30, wanted 3 vodka slices, 2 plain, and a buffalo. they only had 2 and instead of telling us, the dumped vodka sauce over a margarita slice. absolutely disgusting. pizza was cooked unevenly amd soggy..Recently I've been on a Sicilian kick. What that means is I've been craving doughy squares loaded with cheese.While doing some shopping nearby I decided to give this place a try as it was opening and got the first square of the day. Everything tasted fresh and the sauce was just the right amount of sweet. Normally I find this most regular pizzerias use plain sauce and call it a day but this place seemed like they put a little love into their sauce.The interior was clean and behind the counter looked spotless. Not much else going on here.I'd suggest try it out!.Went tonight to get a slice or 2 they were still opened and yet all they had was buffalo slices left and refused to make me anything. Why have hours of operations if you don't follow them?  Very disappointed.Ok just ordered two slices to go.They have the nerve to charge $7.62 for two slices.That is insane. Not to mention it was terrible. Not not bad, it was terrible. I will never go there again.People there are to many better pizzerias within minutes of this place do yourself a favor and go elsewhere..I try to be considerate yet diligent when writing my reviews, taking into note whether someone might have had an off day. However, this pizzeria needs a high bump in quality. With its dated decorations on the door, you would hope the pizza would be better - especially since it's three dollars a slice, which is more than the average in my experience. It isn't the biggest slice either, and honestly isn't very high in quality. The sauce is too sweet and the cheese too dense, not melting in your mouth like you would hope it would. This isn't even mentioning their little A/C, not keeping the place cool. They have such a great location, but I'm willing to bet that that's the only thing keeping them afloat. Would not recommend."
"I went to Andrea to have make me food for my daughter college going away party.  The food was incredible and everyone loved it.  She made two big trays of roasted chicken, two trays of rice and beans and a tray of potato salad.  Everyone gave me compliments on the food.  I will definitely recommend Andreas to all of my friends and family.  A++++++++.I go here Saturdays when I feel lazy to cook to buy my little lunch tray they have a good food, my family and I love it but customer services the worst..I was in the Bronx with my friend..We stop at the Spanish restaurant I order the Grilled chicken with Rice and peas... It was really good.. I will come back again..."
"Starbucks service is exceptional, unbeatable compared to anywhere else. Be kind, make it known your in a rush and the partners will happily assist you. I love this Starbucks. And with so many in the area, you can always shop around for the seasonal merchandise..I gotta say that whoever is the person in charge of music at the time of this writing at about 4PM: taste in music is 10/10 haha..It's a standard Starbucks but the staff are not friendly in the slightest. You're better off visiting one of the other nearby locations unless you want to feel like you're an inconvenience (even if not doing any special requests). Once you are given your drink, if you are not immediately headed out of the store you will also be told off for loitering. I understand the social distancing but there are better ways to do it than how Nadia was doing to people- including us. Get your drink and go away, don't delay otherwise you'll get to experience the added ""hospitality"" they provide..Starbucks service is exceptional, unbeatable compared to anywhere else. Be kind, make it known your in a rush and the partners will happily assist you. I love this Starbucks. And with so many in the area, you can always shop around for the seasonal merchandise. I got myself a cup that was sold out at this location, after getting a referral from one of the team members..I always get my coffee here when I'm at work. Always delicious, never have to wait long and the music is the best while I'm waiting. Staff is friendly and efficient. Love it here..Standard Starbucks in a city filled with Starbucks. never had any issues with drinks ordered form this location. Usually in and out.Sugar stand area was clean and the store itself looked clean too. Employees weren't nasty here.Next!!.Absolutely disgusting. Found hair at the bottom of my drink, will never return here again..The most amazing Chevron, Angelo, Darien and the morning team! I always order from this location because they have not failed me. Never even once! Always ready when I walk into the store for pickup. They have the most amazing service and it's clean. Unlike the other places I've ordered from. Even if there was an Starbucks closer to where I am I still walk the extra blocks to this one!.This is my to go Starbucks for 6 years! Absolutely love the crew they have, especially the morning group! Always friendly and welcoming. They do get extremely busy sometimes. Love love love.I don't go to this Starbucks anymore, but did for most of 2017-2018 (I worked on the block so was a frequent morning customer). I never really had a bad experience, and quite a few of the baristas knew my name and made my customer experience very memorable honestly (I now frequent a less busy Starbucks in a quiet part of Seattle and only 1 manager has learned my name after a year).See a lot of complaints about lack of a restroom, but I think that's pretty typical in smaller shops that cater to office workers who are just stopping by for a pick-me-up in the morning or afternoon so don't really see why people are attacking a franchise store for a smaller layout -- my current Starbucks only has 4 little stool-seats (and no restroom)!.Came to this Starbucks a couple of years ago for a Caramel Frappuccino. After having paid and waited a good 10 minutes, I was told that they did not have the ingredients to make the caramel frapp. Fast forward to present day...lol *smh*  I have a Starbucks Groupon $5 for $10 deal. I returned to this location to get a Caramel Ribbon Crunch Cream Frappuccino. Not one crunch. I was really looking forward to those lil crunchy things...which is why I ordered it. I get to work, take some sips... They gave me a Caramel Ribbon Crunchless Cream Frapp. Maybe, once again, they didn't have the ingredients? I dunno. It's just funny that I've only gone here maybe twice over the 15 years that I've worked in the area. Neither time did I get what I ordered. Beautiful bunch of people behind the counter but, naaaahhhhh. This location is a bust."
"This place is horrible and so is the Service.  The order is never made the way you want it.  They charge you extra just to make your coffee lighter.   The cashier often get involve in argument with the clients.  I stopped going to this location for a while, then I decided to go back hopping that they changed, however is the same old thing.  If I could give them a lower rating I would.  Their services sucks!!!!"
"So glad i stopped by today. This is my local Dunkin and i hadn't been here in months. I was pleased to see they introduced a Matcha Latte-FINALLY!!! It's already sweetened. Talk about a bonus!This team is always pleasant, the service is swift and they're so reliable. Count on this team to great you with a smile, despite whatever is going on. They're right by the J/M at Flushing Avenue, the B46, B57, B43 and B15.Came here for my morning coffee and some breakfast because it was the closest to me. How come Dunkin' Donuts doesn't let you pour your own cream and sugar into your coffee? I am from the West Coast and don't frequent Dunkin' Donuts very often. I ordered an everything bagel with strawberry. They gave me a Multi grain bagel with cream cheese.I had to ask for my small coffee twice. Is it that hard to pour a cup of coffee?.They have a giant sign outside and inside about these new photo donuts- you can order online to have pictures put on donuts and pick them up here. I made an order for my kids birthday and the order said to pick them up at 9 am today. Showed up, they had no idea what I was talking about. I pointed to the sign outside and inside and inside advertising the service and the people who worked there acted like they'd never seen it before. The manager just shrugged and said ""I dunno"" ... um what?.I give this a one star because the service was absolutely terrible! I asked at least 20 times for a bag and the people there just bluntly ignored me and when one of them finally answered I still didn't get my bag! I would give this a 0 star if I could..Worst Dunkin' Donuts in the world. When the workers are making your order it feels like they don't want to be doing it. They ignore you and seem to not understand what you're trying to say tothem. I've been here three times and I'm not going to be returning because they make the things I've gotten wrong, and their attitude makes me feel uncomfortable..I'm come to get a latte and warm up because it's so cold outside,and they got the damn air conditioner on and I ask them why and the workers said they don't know and I ask if they could cut it off and they said they don't have any control,then on top of that the tables always dirty.smh the worst Dunkin' donut I been to in Brooklyn..This DD has become the worst ever. First you post your order online thinking it would save you time. Then when you get to the actual place to pick it up the workers just ignore you while taking other orders. Meanwhile you can see the order you placed online with other orders waiting for pick up on the counter. Than when they finally do acknowledge your presence they are rude as hell, on top of that your order is wrong. So when you ask them to fix it they are super rude. Not keeping in mind that its because you are a paying customer that they are in business and getting paid. This has happened more times than I care to share. The only thing i am saying is that they suck and I advise you to save your money and go somewhere else where your business is appreciated..Woah just because there's a holiday tomorrow, your going to close around 9 PM? Your store is suppose to close around 12AM and without any notice I came down around 9:30 hoping to order a ice tea but apparently you guys had your gates closed down. How can America run on Dunkin when your not even open at the time your suppose to be??? This is my second complain for a Dunkin doughnut store..They definitely need a training on making coffee. I ordered a extra large french vanilla coffee which tasted like regular coffee. It was disgusting. When you come to the register the customer service was poor. They need to clean up the place a little. Everybody look lost like they don't know what they are suppose to be doing.  I had to throw my coffee away. What a waste. Don't think ill be returning..I come here often before I get on the train. Pretty typical but the people are always nice. The line could be long at times but I think for minimum wage over worked workers they do a pretty good job. The one problem I had was that sometimes my coffee is not hot. When I complained yesterday they gave me a free banana and made me a fresh cup. People are a little harsh, these guys are great. Like I said for over worked underpaid immigrants I think they really do a great job.Just keep the coffee hot!"
"I don't usually write reviews for chains like McDonalds, but the  staff and managers at this Mcdonalds is exceptional. There is a closer Mcdonalds to me then this one, but the McDonalds @148 W 125th Street & 7 Av is our default ""home"" for the rare occasions we let ourselves indulge in fast food.Order through the mcdonald's app or go pick it up, I would avoid ubereats, even doordash or grubhub is better.Taniya called me after I filled out the 2 min survey following the link on the back of the receipt. Our food itself was good- hot fries, all 40 nuggets in the piece nuggets, they followed our instructions on the sandwiches (my partner doesn't like pickles on his burgers,  I don't like cheese, we are *those* people). So everything was great! The only issue was the sprite we ordered came as water in a cup. Requested a refund from Ubereats just for that drink and they said ""No"" and were just rude in response to the query. So I filled out they survey on the receipt wondering if anyone would actually respond. The manager called me and apologized! She said there was an issue with the sprite syrup and the drink shouldn't have been sent out! She told me whenever I am in the area to stop in and she will have the whole order remade for me! Beyond generous and kind. Also, just for the completing the survey and providing feedback,  the Mcdonald's area supervisor Orlando Perez mailed me physical coupons for a free burger and a free drink. (There was an option to include your mailing address and I chose to do so) Overall, I am pleased with their response and encourage you to 1. order directly from Mcdonalds 2. provide feedback on your experiences- both positive and negative, the receipt survey took 2 minutes to complete!3. avoid uber eats! Unless you enjoy poor customer service..This is a constant issue with this McDonald's you never get what you paid for they pretty much give you whatever they feel like and hope you don't notice or complain normally they forget my extra hash brown let's be honest I really don't need it so I go about my day. But how I ordered a sausage McGriddle and they send me a chicken McGriddle then stamp the bag that it was 100 verified by a manager. Well that just shows they must not be able to read..Poor communication on order especially with delivery - missing items and food cold because of delay..Manager was great my mobile order didn't add the fries but she took care of me.  Everyone was just great and working like a team.The service here is very rude the employees threw the food on the counter and I waited 17 minutes just fo cookies I would rather go to Chick-fil-A.Horrible service the girl giving the food was so nasty attitude terrible! Another Customer and myself asked for a bag to put our items in did she not throw the bags at us and turned her back to us and walked away. Seriously terrible customer service the girl Shyanne at the cash register was very nice but the other one was really horrible.Don't go here had my credit card  info stolen here by the workers.Went in to get a happy meal for my granddaughter and there were too many teenagers hanging out.  They were rude and noisy and disrespectful towards the security guard..This is my 2nd time eating Mcdonalds this year... This restaurant (I say that loosely) leaves a lot to be desired.. The Manager has a really nasty attitude as though there are no other restaurants in the area. The restaurant is dirty, and full of people who are using the restaurant as a warming center. The restaurant is not taking debits cards today because the system is down, again! So, they refer you to the ATM machine that charges outrageous fees. I definitely will not return...Sending my pictures and letter to the franchise owner.....I went in the McDonald's and it was super crowded and I couldn't even use the touch screen things to order. I had a coupon I wanted to use (free medium fries) and it didn't work for that location cause a technical problem either way they gave me a nasty attitude about it and at the end of it all they didn't honor the coupon. Like whaaaaattt????"
"This is one of my favorite places to order for dinner or lunch. Normally there almost on time and most of the time earlier than the time estimate.Most of the time these are my go-to go plate: Al Pastor Taco: Grilled diced pork marinated in our special blend sauce cooked with onions and chopped pineapples. One of my favorite tacos brings a lot of pork and is very tender very bueno a good option to have. Enchilada taco: spicy pork. Grilled, diced pork marinated with a special blend of sauces. Pretty decent, good taste, and a good amount of meat. La Torta Norteña : steak, bacon with Mexican chesses. Served with tomato, onions, avocado mayonnaise, jalapenos, and re-fried beans. For me no habichuelas por favor. The portion of the torta or sandwich is very generous and comes with a lot of steak and cheese and the jalapenos make it a perfect Torta with a great and delicious taste highly recommend..Forgot to take pictures (screenshot provided from ubereats) but we ordered the Spicy Pork Burrito, Al Pastor Burrito, and the Steak & Chicken Burrito. Food was as pictured (extra for avocado). Price is decent, the burrito isn't as big as others that I've eaten. It tasted okay. The Al Pastor was a bit of a let down, maybe because I was thinking there would be more pineapples in it? The Spicy Pork wasn't spicy; The Steak & Chicken was okay as well. Their salsa was really good though! However it was very very little in amount..A good place to experience South American food. Suitable for family and groups as well. Price is reasonable. Street parking is available. Food quality is mouth watering. They serve you freshly made foods. Wide selection of foods including vegans. Staffs are cordial and well trained. You'll love the music. It's a big plus. Highly recommended for everyone!!.Homemade Taqueria is a small chain with six locations of restaurants in Corona, Astoria, Maspeth, College Point, and more. The tacos, quesadillas, nachos, and other Mexican dishes are made in the first floor kitchen and also available to-go at the outdoor street food style stand. There is indoor dining available on the second floor. The fish, steak, and chorizo tacos were outstanding. It came with three salsas topped with fresh  cilantro, lime, and radish. The restaurant is located on a busy corner under the 7 train at Junction Blvd. It is a great place to check out for its vibrant Hispanic community with endless authentic dining options..Staff is super sweet & nice. The whole place is very welcoming, cozy. Everything here is amazing! 100000% recommend..This is my favorite taco place so far. The price is amazing, and the food is amazing. With 2 tacos im already full. I usually order beef taco, comes with onion and cilantro. Ask for 3 sauces.This is my favorite taco place so far. The price is amazing, and the food is amazing. With 2 tacos im already full. I usually order beef taco, comes with onion and cilantro. Ask for 3 sauces.not sure why they changed the salsa but it had very little flavor and no heat. i was really bummed as i usually love their salsa. hopefully this was just 1 flavorless batch, bc salsa is an important component to Mexican food. the rest of the food was really good!.i've ordered the equivalent of approximately 5 meals from here (for delivery) and everything so far has been fantastic. Steak burrito, chicken quesadilla, grilled chicken, beans & rice, chips & salsa... it's all delicious! i especially love the homemade chips and salsa -- so fresh and flavorful. i'm from SoCal, so i've been exposed to good Mexican food. i can honestly say this place is on the same level. the delivery was also early each time. would definitely recommend!.Tacos and nachos are really good here. We order 3 tacos al pastor, 3 steak tacos, and nachos with steak for $27. Everything was fresh and served hot!I think the al pastor could have used more pineapple and spices for the ""spicy pork"" but other than that, I would come here again if I was in the neighborhood. Nachos had a lot of cheese on them as well!.I am so disappointed this place used to be my favorite spot for tacos in queens. When I ordered my tacos and saw the guy making them he made them as if that was a hamburger from MacDonald's. in addition to that those tortillas they were saggy and dry, the meat was supposed to be ""Al pastor,"" instead they tested... I don't even know how to explain it i am disappointed and worst of all I brought friends with me for the first time. I am beyond embarrassed!!.like this restaurant ，The cuisine is exeptionaly good. the service is dynamic and the personel is courteous. The price is satisfactory. greatly recommend."
"The best coffee and breakfast sandwiches in Brooklyn if not all of New York CityThe corner of 19th St. and sixth Avenue in the South Park slope area of Brooklyn I have been to many coffee shops and without a doubt this place is 5 star.Good sandwiches, but the staff are preposterously slow and rude. If there's even a couple of people in line it's a hard pass, because I'm not waiting 10m to order AND another 20m for them to make an egg sandwich..Always very slow, and with two full loaves of banana bread, they just gave me two slices which were both end slices. Wtf?.Fresh morning baked goods is what I come here for! They do seasonal pastries which are some of the best I've had around the Park Slope area. I was never a fan of scones until now! Their scones are not dry at all which is usually what I experience so I tend to avoid scones. I also love whenever they have cakes and cookies.The staff is super friendly and there's no minimum for a credit card charge. I don't usually get their coffee but my friends do and they love it. This is a popular local place because there is always a line (not ridiculously long) and their bake stuff sell out quick..I ordered the Biscuit Special of the day -- a fat buttermilk biscuit (very flaky) stuffed with bacon, eggs, Cheddar, and pickled jalapeño peppers.It was terrific, yes, but the service could have been better all around. (The workers seemed awfully glum.)Four easy stars with a little wiggle room for five!.First visit to Southside Coffee was a delicious treat. No, I did not actually order any coffee, just a couple sandwiches to share with my girlfriend. We parked down the block and made our way into the restaurant. First, the tuna melt. OMG. Served on a couple slices of toasted rye bread, this tuna melt is the best of its kind that I've had in recent memory. The tuna salad is so good. I'm picky af when it comes to tuna melts, and this one absolutely did the trick. Next, the new school breakfast sandwich: scrambled eggs, bacon, kale, hot sauce, on a sesame seed roll. Tasted absolutely delicious. Pretty big portion, too. So excited to add this to my regular rotation. I highly recommend making a visit, either for a bite to eat or some coffee to sip. Mmm. So damn good..Open for take out and pick up during COVID! Coffee and food available to go, kitchen open Saturday and Sunday 8am-2pm. Yay! We recommend the cheddar chive biscuits, peanut butter cookies, and the soy espresso drinks..We've been coming here for years and I have to say, today is my last visit. My car wouldn't start and we called AAA. They were on their way, so I picked up a coffee to wait. Being 8+ months pregnant, I found myself needing the restroom shortly after. I went back to Southside to ask if I could borrow theirs and the barista flat out told me to use the public washroom down the street. When I explained that I had just purchased a coffee, am heavily pregnant, and reminded her that businesses are unable to deny their restroom to pregnant women, she shrugged and pointed in the direction of the public restroom. This was not her concern. As I made my way down the icy streets, I slipped and fell while trying to make it to the washroom in time. Once I got there, the door of the one and only stall in the public washroom wouldn't close. While this is no fault of Southside, I also have to ask myself what kind of neighborhood shop would deny a heavily pregnant woman the use of their washroom and force her use the one down the street in the middle of winter?I had to ask myself if this is the type of business I wanted to continue to support and the answer is sadly, no. After coming here for years, the treatment I received today is utterly disappointing..This was my go to place to work out of pre pandemic and it was always great! Good sandwiches , coffee and amazing selection of treats that are baked fresh and different every day . Reading someone else's review reminded me of a weird period of time where I really didn't like this place and it took me months to come back . The staff had a strange and unfriendly attitude , frequently berated people for bringing any outside snacks , which made me feel uncomfortable. I get that it's a place that serves food , but there are zero options that aren't carbs / pastries and there is a nicer way to express that . That said , since Covid , they've hired some new people that are always so friendly and welcoming . Wait times can be long but it's worth it !.On a normal weekend you won't find me up before 11 a.m. But occasionally, the plus side of having a screwed up sleeping schedule is getting to hit up Southside for their soy lattes, chai lattes, and heavenly cinnamon buns.It's nice and relatively quiet at around 8:30 a.m. More importantly, the cinnamon buns are still there (I've learned from experience that they usually run out by late morning to early afternoon). They're delicious and one of my favorite cinnamon buns around. Each towering piece is fluffy and airy, sticky from the cinnamon sugar glaze at the bottom, and topped with a creamy, decadent cream cheese frosting. The chocolate chip banana bread is also great. Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong with any of their baked goods.Although I've frequented this coffee shop for a while, only recently did I get a chance to try their breakfast sandwiches. The New School comes with bacon, scrambled eggs, and Sriracha miso-tahini kale on a seeded hero roll. This sandwich is massive, and the roll has a good outer crunch while still being more pliant and airy. No scratched roof of the mouth here. Look out for their rotating paper bag specials, which are true to the name and tacked on the wall. I got the biscuit special with scrambled eggs, bacon, white cheddar, and pickled jalapeños, and it was marvelously greasy and tasty as expected. I still need to try their namesake breakfast sandwich... and every other one on the menu.The service is fine. I'm a grab-and-go kind of customer, so I've never stuck around long enough for it to matter to me..Amazing spot. Try the biscuit,egg,bacon & cheese! The latte is amazing and good! Friendly and good food!"
"A friend brought me here as I was visiting from San Diego and wasn't sure where to go. OMG! Day drink at this bar. Anthony and Ruby are lovely and we all had a great time. I'll try to get back before we leave NYC. Pieces is a great neighborhood bar and you need to day drink there. Thanks for the fun times A and R..Been here for many years. Unfortunately my last two visits were filled up with flat out discrimination. The bouncer kicked me out pushing me even though I told him I said I was leaving. He broke my phone I called back the owner but never took responsibility of it. It just happened again today. Pushed out by a nasty man. No explanation. Just cause I'm Latino.   I even asked the bartender if I didn't tip him right.  He a knew it. I work in the business , I always at least 20%.this place is SUPER small and there was barely any seating inside so we only came in to go out. the bathroom is all the way in the back but there's really only one hallway through the entire place so you have to pass through BODIES before being able to reach the back. there was drag performances going on but honestly, it looked very ""last minute-ish"" where they didn't have an actual performance thought out and they were just walking and lip-syncing. overall, cute but disappointing. maybe i'll come back and try it out again when it isn't so crowded..Horrible staff, the bouncer of this place didn't let my friend in with a valid ny id and wanted to see ""more proof of immigration status"" so only citizens are allowed in? I'll never come back and you shouldn't either..Overcharged my card and forced me to pay bill. Beware of bartender named Caesar who did that..This place is the worst. Don't go. Bouncer w locks is an asshole. The dancers were great tho. It's not their fault the owner is a piece of shit..Clearly all you have to do to bartend here is be a cis white twink or beefcake.  Noone knows how to make a coctail.  They overpour im sure it cost the owners money,  i mean noone can make a manhattan or gimlit?  Definatly need training or hire me!!!  But wait, im black and skilled.  That woukd never happen.If you want to go to a place with shirtless bartenders that are all jaded and not really fond this is the place for you. After paying $20 cash told me to get inside I waited 47 minutes to get to drugs. One drink was $26 for Bacardi and Coke. The bartenders save less than Tuesday about their jobs despite the fact that they had many willing patrons desperate to get drugs. I'm not sure if it's the management or the staff but either way it was a shit show. I guess the cash Only door policy was a way for them to skate pay taxes but whatever I'll leave that for New York City to investigate overall it was the shittiest experience I've had in a bar in New York City and I've lived here for 47 years.Terrible customers who come up to you and harass you for photos while trying to pay for a drink. You should really check for people who are, ""See You Next Tuesday's."" Also the drink prices are outrageous. Never again.It must have been Agatha All Along,.I didn't come to a bar to get called up to the stage for a 'show' and have racist shit and jokes said about me while the Asian drag queen tells the white guys on the stage how hot they are. It's total bullshit and just sad cause this shit happens all the time. The other drag queen was cool and nice though."
"The food was though they were stingy with the portions, especially the tacos. The margarita pitchers were also some of the best I've ever had..Finally got a chance to try the brunch here and I'm so glad I did! Overall the place has a cool vibe and everyone working there was super nice and helpful. To start we got shishito peppers, which were delicious.  I got the smoky jalapeño margarita, which was actually fairly spicy and really good. I tried my sister's passion fruit margarita and it was obviously great (it's pretty much always the best flavor to get).  My other friend got the cucumber margarita, which was good (honestly tasted slightly like a face mask, but that didn't bother me lol).  For food I split the fish tacos and the enchiladas with my sister. The fish tacos were fantastic and I would definitely get them again. The enchiladas were great, but I kind of wish they had some vegetables or something in them besides just cheese. My friend got the chilaquiles, which were actually better than they had looked in the pictures. I would get that instead of the enchiladas next time. Overall, we had a great time and the food was delicious. Would totally recommend for brunch and will come back for happy hour! Btw they have a good pulsd deal for brunch!!.I've had this place on my list for so long - eating bugs?! yes please! Got a reservation fairly easily and there were lots of open tables when I went for dinner Saturday night. My friend and I ordered a few things to share and honestly... was a bit disappointed. The blank ant guacamole was the best thing we had. It was very delicious and barring the black specs (ants) tastes like a normal guacamole - don't think i tasted any bugs in any of the foods. 10/10 would come back for this. Everything else was okay - nothing special but not horrible. Won't be coming back for anything unless other friends want to try some bugs. Side note: during dinner there was one INCREDIBLY loud man at this bar that every single person could hear when he spoke. Comically annoying..I AM BEYOND ANNOYED WITH THIS PLACE. The food was eh. The service was so annoying to deal with we even stopped ordering because he was taking so long.  Super pricey. I planned a surprise brunch for my sisters boyfriend birthday and all his friends showed up and made sure to keep reminding the person up front that it was a surprise and not to mention anything about other being there or any other names that were at our table and SHE BLATANTLY repeated the name in front of the  birthday guy and even went as far as saying oh yes its. A surprise so everyones in the back waiting for you. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. Luckily it was just a birthday but i cant imagine if it was something else. And on top of that she gave attitude when I corrected her and gave dirty looks. Hostess needs an attitude check.Dont waste your time. There are other brunch spots you will enjoy..I was invited to The Black Ant for my cousin's birthday brunch. I liked that there was a private room just for our party so we can be as loud and tipsy as we wanted lol. So to start off we had guacamole and chips. The guacamole was pretty good but I was kinda annoyed that there wasn't enough for the whole table. It was just a taste really I was able to have. For my brunch entree I had the Chilaquiles which was absolutely delicious but once again skimpy on the amount they served and when you're drinking basically tequila and a splash of orange juice you need more than a spoonful of food lol. Now since I started with the drinks-we had a choice of margaritas and mimosas. I chose the margaritas which was strongggg. It didn't taste like a margarita at all lol but I guess it didn't matter once you're two margaritas in lol. All in all I had a fantastic time here..Good food and amazing brunch experience. The hostess was witty and definitely set us up for a memorable afternoon. Had the 27 bottomless brunch option and it was well worth it (the options are mimosa, margarita or spicy margarita.) The staff did not let my glass drop my get below halfway. I had the equivalent of roughly 5-6 drinks. Definitely the type of boozy brunch that leaves you loose.Great experience all and all. The food was alright..They don't call this place the Black Ant for nothing! They're are actual insects in some of the dishes. Like the guacamole for example, it has black ants on top with pepitas and pomegranate seeds for that added crunch. Funny because my friend who frequents this place had no idea! Lol so that goes to show the taste is altered in no way at all, and the ants do add a nice crunchy topping to the otherwise smooth mushy gauc. Great friendly staff, make a reservation if you can because it is not that large inside and can fill up rather quickly. I got the chicken mole taco diner bc the chicken mole plate was not available. Still great mole! My friend enjoyed the octopus plate especially the puréed cauliflower, however he did mention the octopus could have been more crisp to subdue its chewy texture. Great smokey margaritas!.A very interesting experience.If you are up for trying something new. Here is your shot.Came here for brunch Saturday morning and this place was amazing. The hostess and staff were very nice and those mimosas truly made me forget all my responsibilities as an adult lol. Food was amazing and for someone that does not like sunny side up eggs and wanted to try something different, they lived up to my expectations. I will for sure be back for another brunch outing..Came here for bottomless brunch with a party of ~20 and made the reservation the day before, so I'm really thankful they still had spots for us!The lesson I learned was to try and ask for not the back room (all the way back and to the left there's enclosed room with no windows) - it was too echo-y for a big group. My friend came here before with a big group but in the main area and said it was fine, so it might've just been that room!Food and drinks wise it was all great! Bottomless brunch came fast enough that you could definitely fit in 2-6 drinks (depending on your pace and enthusiasm). The only downside is they only have 3 options: mimosas, margs, and spicy margs.The food came correctly for everyone in our group and it was a smooth experience planning :)Overall was great experience!"
"5 stars just for Richie Cannata. If you don't know who that is, look him up! He performs here every Monday night with a band and allows for locals to join and perform!He had personally invited the people I went with to the gig! It was honestly one of the best concerts I've been to in such a small, simple venue.The place itself had a $10 cover charge which was very nice. If you sit down, they do have a 2-drink minimum. If you want, just grab some of the non-alcoholic drinks and you'll spend about $10 more..The bitter end is a historic location in New York City where folk music had it start in the 60s, and famous acts like comedian George carlin and Lady Gaga performed. Now it's a little bit more low-key with local music created for a more mature audience including jazz fusion and I've been there for some other comedy shows that my friends hosted. It's an interesting space with a large space stage with a beautiful blue carpet. The two servers who are friendly and attentive. They have a two drink minimum and the cover charge is around $10 for a Saturday night. This is where you come if you're more of a musician, as opposed to red lion down the block where you will get some cheesy cover bands.It's a historic location so it's absolutely worth checking out for the history of music and that's why I see a lot of tourists out front.I will always continue to come here to support the local music scene in New York City. A bunch of my friends have played here and some of them have even recorded records. Now they have much more updated technology and I think any bands can record their show..I bought a ticket at the bar to support my student. Came down, sat at the bar, was asked to move down the bar so that someone else could sit in their seat, and then the host put two people in front of me who blocked the whole show. And they didn't have a ticketed deal. Disgusted!  So glad this host wasn't here when I played at the club almost 20 years ago.! Absolutely vile treatment of paying customers ..It's home away from home!I have been coming to The Bitter End since the 60's using fake ID (sorry CAZ) Its a slice of history for serious music lovers...still smells the same..I love everyone affiliated with this great venue, its like coming home!GREAT original music , Intimate venue.....Man I stay the hell away from NYU country if I can but I'll go pretty much anywhere for live music. I got in half price the night I came because they only had one band left. Atlas Gray, with an amazing song called Bagel Believe, about how carbs and a bit of schmear can save the world and bring us all together - check em out! Along with the cover is a 2 drink minimum. The bar is small and narrow, filled up mostly by tables with waitress service. It's old and cramped and dirty and lovely. The women's bathroom is narrow and has the most hilariously hazardous first step..The Bitter End is one of the places fans of live music should be sure to visit if they happen to be in the East Village and are looking for something interesting to do.  The club has been here for decades and is generally going to have four or five live acts across the night.  The bands get paid by the amount of people who come to see them that night so let's assume my friends in Command Z are performing, then anyone who comes in and says ""we are here to see Command Z"" will add to the amount that they get paid on that night for that set.  The sets are generally an hour unless the band has worked out something special with the house but its unlikely.  For those who perform there is a backline provided which means amps and standard drums.  The guitar players need to bring heads while the drummers are encouraged to bring a snare drums, cymbals and their bass drum pedals.  Some also require the high hat clutch but I am not certain that The Bitter End asks their artists to do that.  The Bitter End is mostly a seated venue and there is table service for anyone who chooses to sit.  The server will not take kindly to you just chilling out since this is how she is making her own money and be careful of where you stand if you choose to do so.  I cannot count how many times I am in the way of their fast moving waitstaff.  I don't think I've found the perfect spot to be out of the way in the years I have been coming there.I don't recall the place having an open WiFi so pardon me on that.  I will suggest that if you plan on being in the region, that you open their event page and then do some Facebook or YouTube searching to see if you like who might be playing that night so you can mention their name and help their own set while rocking out.  The full bar should greatly assist you in that part as much as the music..I visited this place yesterday and it was great. Good vibe, and most importantly perfect drinks. I went to see one specific singer Nicolette Capua. She has so much passion and such a beautiful voice. I'm not sure when is her next show but It's a must go if she shows up. The place was packed but they have enough space and chairs. The ticket was pretty affordable $10 , the service and servers were super friendly totally worthy! Nicolette Capua s fan..It's a legendary music venue in the Village.  Appropriately divey-esque. Great musicians.  The normal drill: $10.00 fee at the door.  Two drinks minimum.  Close friendly seating. Enjoy the show! The staff is friendly and efficient. No qualms. Tonight:  Funk Shui brass band were fabulous!!.Iconic Bar where you can hear live music. Owner, Paul , is great. Never seems to forget a face. They often have live music performances by up and coming performers. It is much smaller than I imagined but nice so you can see the show. If you are going to be there for an extended period of time, eat first. They do not serve food!.Good venue for striving artists. Lights and sound are pretty official. Quite a different experience for the audience. Super nasty about the 4+ ppl at a table, 2 drink minimum, per show specifics. Like chill out, we got money AND a party of 5. Mixed drinks are horrendously watered down and small. Rude bartender service when we mentioned how weak they were. Can't expect much more from Bleeker st area establishments, unfortunately."
"I haven't eaten subway sandwiches since 2015 and was surprisingly disappointed. My chicken breast did not seam to be chicken at all, tasted like soy meat. Husband's steaks was more or less OK but better than chicken for sure. And his garlic & cheese bread was not that bad too. The quality of the products is poor, veggies and greens were not fresh at all. Our goal was to full the stomach quickly and for a long - and we achieved it. So I give 3 stars. And overall it is better than any deep fried fast food or super-greasy marinara pasta which I feel much worse after..This subway is pretty good. They were professional and exercised safety when it came to making my sandwich. I ordered the tuna on wheat bread and they took the time to make sure it was made well. They took off the gloves when it was time to take my money. Very nice and very professional workers. Quality product..It's by far the worst Subway I've been to. I've ordered a pizza and when he get it out of the oven he struggled for nearly 5 minutes to get off the paper sheet and when I had it the dough was still frozen at some parts! The tomato wasn't fresh at all. I just had a few bites as I was really starving and threw away the rest of the frozen dough.If you ended up here just don't order a pizza!.Hair in the sandwich. I chewed and found hair in the chicken sub. Went there to get refund since I paid with credit card. The manager did not apologized to me and said I am the first person who complains about this kind of stuff. They did not give me the receipt 20 min ago when ai bought so I could not get refund. The manager did not say a sing word ""sorry"" and was very rude. Dont come here or inspect you sub before every bite. Gross..Just got a pastrami 6 in from here! Haven't been to a Subway in 8 mos, and I had my doubts, but I was craving that flavorful pastrami they have, and it was so yummy! The staff were friendly and the line moved in an organized way so I didn't have to wait even tho there were customers. The ingredients were fresh and they cleverly warmed my sammich when it had just cheese and meat on it--nice! Veggies therefore remained crisp. Would go again. PS cookies looked good, they had one called raspberry lemonade and I was like whaaa.No I don't want the sandwich, drink and dessert combo set... I just want one 6"" meatball sandwich puleeeze. I felt like I was at a car dealership being hustled to add options to a car yet I only wanted to spend $3 for the Sunday meatball deal.  I just had to keep smiling and keep refusing and finally gave in and bought a pack of 3 cookies.  The young Indian man cut his finger while he was making my sandwich and oh dude... no blood topping please.  Me no vampire.It was a rare visit to New York and I won't go back to this location anytime in this life.  Better off to head to the $1 pizza spot nearby..I door dash from this place! Ordered @12 pm it said estimate arrival 1:15pm it's 2:25 pm now and it seems as if they saw the order and never tried to even make it, I got hit with contact support for order . After trying to cancel it several times since its taking forever door dash says I can't cancel cause subway is already making my order this is insane !! I also called the restaurant 3 times and no answer I now have to make sure I get my money back from this order I will never receive! Don't waste your time here!.The guy that works there at night is rude. Never greets me or says thank you. Place doesn't look that clean..Do not eat here. The server that just made my sandwich must be the most miserable person on earth; I'll never get another sandwich at this location again. Why give money to someone that can't speak, grunts to ask questions, prepares a sandwich as thought it's a task that is so very far beneath him... etc. The food prep area is a nightmare, cross contamination everywhere, sloppy, messy, etc. Honestly - I can't remember food ever looking so disgusting. I won't be going back unless Subway or the health department does something to clean this place up..Overpriced sandwich that I had to throw away. Undercooked rubbery chicken. The employees are friendly and nice, just not very accommodating. The restaurant seems clean enough, but a bad product ruins everything, especially at that price point. This is the perfect example of why trickle down economics is the worst. The corporate owners are too stupid to figure out how to fix their overall brand. This causes the product and customer experience to degenerate which eventually causes all franchise owners to lose money."
"The girl at the front does her best to give the best service she can , the whole staff do. I walked in , in the middle of a rush and she still managed to multitask in all the stress . This place has great food and overall a great experience :).I have always eaten from this restaurant, but finding residue from y'all pans in my food is UNACCEPTABLE. I ordered 3 trays of food and 2/3 had the same problem ALL over the food. I didn't realize until the middle. CHANGE YALL POTS AND PANS.Chinese joints are on every corner in NYC, and this one is the next closest to where I am. Why I choose to go here rather than the one directly up my block is for a couple of reasons. 1) the food genuinely tastes better and less greasy. 2) they have a nice selection of Thai style dishes in addition to the usual Chinese offerings. 3) most importantly, the people who work here, particularly the lady at the counter, are very nice and friendly. That to me makes all the difference. Whether on the phone or in person, they are always pleasant and it feels nice to at least be seen to be appreciated as a customer..Clean, consistent, above average and reliable. What more  could you ask for from your local bodega style Chinese fast food store in the hood.  It's not fine dining but it will get you by when you don't feel like traveling out or paying $20 for a quick meal on Uber eats..1st time ordering. I order the Thai basil shrimp fry rice n chicken wings. Well, i received a pleasant surprised.  The Thai rice was to die for, along with great presentation n plentiful. Upscale Thai restaurant worthy without the $15 tag. Trust me I'm a Thai food whore. With the exception of the shrimp serving. Which its was scarce but for 6 bucks, I will be ordering n happily paying for extra shrimp next time. If u not to fond of hot chili peppers make sure to say. Cause they will kick u from time to time. The wings were great, didn't have that old overused frying oil taste. In a nutshell I'm extremely impressed n I'm ordering again tnite..To start with they are very nice and very hardworking family . What makes them different that they do have some Thai food on their menu, and if you like Thai food you should definetley give it a chance. My only complain is like other Chinese foods I wish they kept their place cleaner. But food is good..New Sunny is my favorite Chinese fast food restaurant and I've tried several places in my life. I never feel gross or heavy after eating their food. Great price, great delivery time and their Thai menu is delicious. I recommend the Thai basil noodles! That's my favorite..This shit is Nast I ordered General tso's chicken the chicken taste like mush I ask for extra sauce for the general tso chicken that was not delivered and The rice fucking hard I would not recommend this place and no I would not order from here ever again..Really good thai food and excellent customer service, every time I come to order the lady is so nice with same energy every time. Don't judge a book by its cover..First  time ordering from here, ordered from the Thai menu had the chicken pad Thai and red curry and it was surprisingly good! Delivery came fast. Given that there are literally no Thai food restaurants in the neighborhood, I will definitely be ordering from here again!"
"Great experience at this DD. I ordered the medium iced coffee and in moments it was in my hand. The cashiers were awesome and the manager Wendy even said hi as she was tending to other things.Great customer service, and fast service. Will be back again..Worst Dunkin' experience I've had yet. Besides the fact that NONE of the workers were wearing masks...Absolutely rude and disrespectful management. Don't waste your time with these people. Teach your 40 year old employees customer service before putting them at a register.. pastry's are almost always stale as you will find out in MANY other peoples reviews. The price of my latte usually comes out to 4.50 or so..sometimes 5.50 (for some reason). Well this latte came out to 6.25! No big deal. Wasn't starting a prob about it, I know NY rips people off but when I kindly mentioned "" oh 6.25 huh""? I wasn't going to complain or make a fuss I just casually said that In case maybe they typed it in wrong. Well immediately without a second to answer her this cashier said oh you don't want it, canceled my order and walked away from me! I couldn't believe how unprofessional these people were. She said oh I don't make price, don't blame me. Repeated herself says , ""oh don't blame me"" I don't make price"" I was not pissed off about it until she gave me a crappy unprofessional attitude. I never once gave the hint I was ""blaming"" her nor was I not getting my coffee. Horribly customer service! I don't need to deal with rude unprofessional people at 6:30am on my way work. Not going to be coming back..I walked in to get a cup of joe and my free donut for Veterans Day since I am a veteran. The owner was the one that helped me. I asked if I could have a coffee roll instead of a regular donut and he obliged. Upon checking they ran out of the coffee rolls so he gave me an apple fritter along with a whole bag of donuts on the house. This is one place that I will continue to return to because they take care of our military families..Ok dunkin - less variety of donuts and blueberry is my favorite. They were pretty fast though..This is the worst DD , I've ever been to hella rude manager who don't even listen to ur order properly and rushes u and also I ordered a croissant over egg n cheese and instead he gave me a damn bacon with no eggs nor cheese and I paid full price can't even return it or get a refund cause I'm far and I didn't check so anoyying, Also my iced tea is so bland tastes like water with no lemons . DONT GO THERE AND WASTE UR TIME OR UR MONEY NOT WORTH IT.This place isn't actually bad, but the cashiers can use some improvement. The drinks are great, just a little pricey but it's worth it. I only come 3 times a year so I don't get to see much. I hope to make more spare time to hang out here more often!.So this place clearly says 24 hours. I came at 10:00pm exactly... i don't know what their menu is and what kind of donuts they have because all dunkin donuts have certain donuts. This place clearly has seats and enough staff but they locked the doors and not letting anyone in and serving customers by the window. They don't even understand english well. Idk what kind of 24 hour crap this place is -.-.They tried to charge me $1 for a cup of ice even after i already purchased coffee and they wonder why starbucks is running them out of business.Fast and efficient, just how a dunkin or Starbucks should be. When I got in the cashiers quickly got through the line. I got my iced coffee in my hand 2 minutes after going in. Quick with no hassle, I will definitely be back.Pro tip: They provide free wifi, awesome place to get some work done in between meetings!.The worst! No bathroom. No wifi. And I paid $2.71 for a SMALL hot chocolate. TF?!Save your money and find another DD that knows how to treat its customers"
"I've been coming here for years, usually for their baked chicken, but all the food looks good. You can put together a nice plate by picking whatever is available behind the counter - rice, beans, beef, spaghetti. The pizza looks good, as does whatever they cook on the grill..Terrible customer service from the older lady serving. The rice was dry and so was the baked chicken..Mann, I don't know about some of the bad reviews I see here and there but I was very satisfied with the service and food I received...they even gave me extra syrup like I asked! Lol, definitely going to be my got to spot for quick delivery...love it!.Ok so at one point I really liked tbis place. But now there is a Panamian lady who claims to be the owner who is just so rude and disrespectful. She obviously thought I didn't speak Spanish as she referred to me as a stupid white guy then after i questioned her about my food order she claims that she don't need any attitude and then insisted on telling me if I don't like it I don't have to come back. Let me remind you I've been coming here for about 2 yrs no problems at all. Then She comes from wherever or whatever rock she crawled out from under and totally made me feel like I have no right going here. Don't support people that view you as money and not as people..Food is well seasoned,  the steak and onions with mac & cheese and candied yams is DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!.I would give negative stars if allowed. We ordered 3 bacon cheeseburgers via uber eats and none of them had bacon on it. The bread was extremely soggy and falling apart. The burger was over cooked and charred which made it difficult to eat with a knife and fork since the bread was so soggy..I eat here all the time staff is funny the restaurant is small with just 3 stools and 4 tables but there's a variety of food and chose between Spanish food soul food pizza sandwiches and grill food. The prices aren't bad and they also have daily specials. Opens at 6 am and closes at 6 pm except Sunday's when they close at 2 pm. Breakfast ends around 4 pm"
"Overview: this place WAS daisys III, but this place has legit Mexican and legit pizza. Not sure how. I've gotten the chorizo, al pastor, and steak tacos. They are not only delicious, but a healthy size as well. The green salsa is on point. A bit spicy but nothing crazy. I've gotten a supreme pie here and a pepperoni extra cheese. This is not super thin pizza but not thick either. In between but the toppings are generous and overall tastes amazing. They are fast to deliver and have always been friendly. Highly recommend..Pizza was good I also order Buffalo wings was I got was fried chicken wings with Buffalo sauce on the side  that sucks wh you order Buffalo wings you should get Buffalo wings.Wow. What a wonderful surprise. From the outside, one couldn't really tell what is so special about this pizzeria but the pies are amazing! My son and I often seek for the best green peppers and onions slices (his favorite). Unfortunately they didn't have green peppers but offered to substitute red peppers which i was sure my 3 year wouldn't approve but guess what...he did and I did as well. The sauce on the pie was incredibly favorful and tasted homemade and the pie crust was perfect.  Overall the service was super friendly and accommodating. They even have one of those old fashion gum ball machine in the restaurant. Upon glancing at the menu, i realized this is a ""mexican"" style pizzeria.  This is the first time ever in one. I honestly say that they serve some of the best pizza in the city. Thank you!.Ever since they re-opened they've been amazing! The pizza has been upgraded. It seems like they have a new owner, and it has turned around ever since. Service is fast and reliable, and the shop looks clean even in busy days.Regz NY Pizza is definitely really wonderful. The price was very reasonable - I couldn't believe it! Every single thing we got was great and the menu itself was to die for. Workers are incredibly welcoming. They're attentive, respectful and always on their game. Overall I would go to this place again and again..This place deserves 10 stars! The service i recieved from Raul the owner was excellent. The food is AMAZING. I have been here 2 times now and tried their pizza and burgers and they are beyond tasty. The burgers were juicy and had this nice sauce that made it even more tasty. The pizza is just fantastic..Regz has great tacos. Amazing menu. Even the disco fries (fries with cheese) are true to form.... The grandma slices are garlic-y, the guys are really nice and they make some great food. I'm totally into the place and urge you go to check it out. They even have gyros. Just good, normal NYC pizza plus..This place is wonderful people who are spreading love and good food. Making and sharing the trump American dream! Well worth it! Quality pizza and Mexican food want to to try much more though soon..Credit card minimum $10 including tax. But if you pay with cash, no tax. Wait, is that legal? I've come here for tacos mainly. I've gotten the steak, spicy pork, chicken and al pastor. Obviously not all in one visit. But different visits. Haha. What I can say is that I'm pretty impressed with their tacos. It's $2.75 each but if you get three, it's $7.50. That's def a deal! They also have other menu selections like pizzas, gyros, and burgers. I'll most likely try other menu items in the future. As of now, tacos are life!.Went there for Tacos this afternoon. Had three tacos of Carnitas, both me and my wife, Wow!!!! Very filling and love every bite. Would definitely stop by again next time I'm in town.Went there for Tacos this afternoon. Had three tacos of Carnitas, both me and my wife, Wow!!!! Very filling and love every bite.

"We ordered tortellini with marinara, penne with meat sauce, 3 cheesecake slices, Caesar salad, cheese calzone, and garlic knots with mozzarella on 'em. Everything was EXCELLENT. When I'm in the area this will definitely be my go-to place for pasta.  The sauce was tangy, the garlic knots were garlicky, and for me, the tortellini tasted fresh rather than frozen.It also has some Mexican food which sort of worried me a bit, mixing menus like that, but if the Mexican fare is as good as the Italian then no doubt it's excellent. The delivery was on time, and the food was so hot that I couldn't touch the bottom for a while. My only complaint is that there direct website is apparently quite old and incredibly inaccurate. Someone needs to fix that ASAP..Before I even say anything you have to know that the prices as super cheap. I am so excited that we found this place. They have all types of food here. You have to try their spinach and cheese empanada. They aren't empanadas like mamas empanadas. They are the ones that are made with flour. The Pizza isn't so bad either we like that they have pizza deals. I beleieve it was $20 for wings, pizza, garlic knots and 2lt soda. In my opinion that is not to shabby. Unfortunately, I didn't get to use the bathroom here so I can't do my bathroom expert duty...no pun intended. Some of their sandwiches are pretty good to0 we had the chicken and parm. Overall we only been here once but it has not stopped us from getting delivery at least twice a month. As for the workers well they are really nice. We met the owner once and he gave us a free soda since the order that we got was messed up. PLEASE PLEASE TRY THE MIXED BURRITO..Omg this place serves pizza, french fries, tacos, and a variety of other Italian and Mexican food. It's a nice grab and go place to get food. It's also a nice place to sit and eat for 20 to 30 minutes. There are 5 tables and this place sits about 17 people in total. Service is fast and the workers are very polite. I recommend this place totally. Just wish it had a nice outside sitting area because it can get a bit hot in here, but not too hot..Place is very welcoming the owner is nice and pleasant  if its about 5 people at a time  it is halal style pizza with a the twist of Neapolitan the crust is just right and if you use the marinara sauce from the garlic knots to dip it it is to die for delivery is under 10 minutes as long as it's under a mile I haven't tried the pasta yet the desert are not done on premise and I am biased when it comes to burgers GeneralEat there again I will have delivery I pass it on to my coworkers and I do recommend it to others.I love this place! I get the garden salad and spinach empanadas, every Friday! It's delicious and inexpensive!.One Stop Pizza & Restaurant is amazing. The pizza is always on point, delicious. I've never had to wait long for my food to be ready to pick up and the man who runs the place is a delight. Always working hard. You can trust One Stop Pizza!.I was looking for halal meat pizza so found this place and decided to try it. Honestly i am still regretting that I why I even think of going there. We ordered 1 meat combo pizza and cheese burger.  Pizza was the worst I mean really crap. He made everything fresh infront of me but pizza was all watery meat toppings smells like ****. And the cheese burger I would never even think of going to this place in my life again.I would not recommend meat pizza or burger dont know anything else ....who knows might be the same..I really like this place and stop in several times a week .I've had the chance to get to know the owner over time. He is one of the nicest guys in the world. Incredibly honest and super hardworking. He slaves away at the oven for 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.It doesn't hurt that the plain slice is exactly how New York style pizza should be. The other slices are good too, particularly for halal food. Prices are super cheap..When this place first opened I considered myself a fan because they were selling pizza for 99cents. I was so hyped to have a 99cent pizza spot 2 blocks from my house. However that soon changed. They did it to get people in the door and for the two weeks they had 99cent pizza it worked. Now a regular slice is $1.50 and a topping slice is $2.25. Been here a couple of times and I have to say their pizza isn't very good at all. I'm still trying to find out if it's because they make the pizzas in the early morning and it just sits there all day. This seems especially true for the topping slices, or if they just use shit ingredients. I honestly think it's a combination of the two. The sauce on the plain slice was awful. The two topping slices I had were so dry because sauce was almost non existent. I felt I was eating cheese, dough and toppings.  Had they stayed a 99cent pizza place I would cut them some slack but there are other pizza joints that sell slices for 25cents more and the quality is way better than One Stop. Tastys or Astoria Park Pizza to name a couple. I can't even justify going back here. I ate my slices on two separate occasions and both times I felt somewhat sickish afterwards. As though my stomach just didn't agree with what I just ate. Glad I didn't decide to try anything else on the menu and if their pizza made me feel like I wanted to throw up I won't even make an attempt at anything else.  After coming a couple times odd are I won't be back again. I'll pay an extra quarter for an enjoyable slice that doesn't unsettle my stomach thank you very much. The fries here were actually pretty good but the portion size was so small. Good:cheap pricesfriesBad:plain slice ($1.50)topping slice ($2.25)Hawaiian sliceBuffalo chicken slice.Yikes - not a fan. Ordered a garden salad, pepperoni slice, buffalo chicken slice, and zeppoles. Salad was really cold like the vegetables had been frozen and thawed and I also found a mysterious slimy ingredient in there (I literally have no idea what it could've been), pepperoni slice reminded me of pizza from my high school cafeteria (cardboard crust with bland marinara sauce), buffalo chicken slice was also bad (the buffalo sauce it came slathered in was really gross). Only good thing were zeppoles - they weren't anything special but they were good however I'd be surprised if someone could mess up deep fried dough covered in powdered sugar. Yes, prices are on the cheaper side but I still wouldn't consider ordering from them in the future. Just pay $1 more for great pizza instead of settling for this place."
"I went last night after to visit the MoMA and I was fascinated with the most amazing dessert that I have tried is mango coco souffle!! Favela cubana is the best Latin spot in West village. Highly recommend!!.Favela Cubana, located just south of Washington Square Park on LaGuardia Place, is a small restaurant offering Cuban and Brazilian foods. For the purposes of this review, I'm going to break it down by the food itself, and the presentation / restaurant itself. THE FOOD: I ordered the Squid Ink Seafood Rice, with a side of Maduros and a Havana Mojito to top it all off. For desert, I had the Raspberry sorbet. The Maduros ($8) are a perfect side for any entree at Havana Cubana - sweet, light, and delicious. They were a great addition to my meal. The Squid Ink Seafood Rice ($32) was the true standout of my meal. The flavors are perfectly balanced, especially after adding some lime. For how much seafood is in this dish, it somehow escapes the overly ""seafood-y"" taste some dishes like this can have. All the seafood is well seasoned and cooked, to have a great taste without too much saltiness, and all the flavors blend together nicely without any one ingredient standing out too much. I've had this dish once before and it was just as good then - I would definitely recommend it to anyone curious. The portion is also very generous, as I barely finished it both time. (And no, the squid ink part should not scare you away - the flavor is subtle and yummy!)The Havana mojito ($17) was definitely yummy, but nothing too special. I'm not sure it was quite worth the $17 price tag, but I don't regret getting it. And finally, the raspberry sorbet ($8), by this point, I was very full, but I couldn't stop eating this sorbet! It was nice, smooth, and possibly homemade - something about it tasted fresh, or made from premium ingredients. It's hard to put a finger on it, but it was a great end to the meal. THE RESTAURANT: It was a Friday night, but the restaurant was about half full; on earlier visits, I've seen the place packed, but on this night the smaller number of guests allowed for great service. Our waitress was patient, and checked on us often. Our food and drinks came very quickly, which was nice since we ordered around 8:45pm, and we were already very hungry. The ambience was great throughout the whole restaurant, with the music at a good volume and the lights at a nice level. Side note: We were sitting in the half-outdoor, half-indoor patio area constructed during COVID, and when suddenly, about halfway through our meal, it started dumping outside and the tables in the dining area started getting wet from the open windows, an employee of the restaurant quickly ran outside and closed all the windows. He got completely soaked - I really respected his dedication to giving the customers a great experience! OVERALL: I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to have a great meal, with dishes you probably don't get chances have very often. While it may be a little expensive, if you don't plan on drinking, this could still be a relatively affordable dinner option. Its warm and inviting atmosphere could make Havana Cubana a great spot to take a date or your family, or even just to take yourself out to!.The lunch special here is a great deal; half a soup, half a sandwich and a salad for $15. The veggie sandwich is delicious as the bread is crispy, the vegetables well cooked and the sauce plentiful.  The butternut squash soup is light an flavorful, I appreciate that it is not too creamy.  The atmosphere is nice with Latin music even at lunch. The service was a little slow but very friendly.  Great lunch experience overall..I've walked past this spot a million times when going to WSP and decided to pop in for brunch this past weekend.  Cuban & Brazilian food both in 1 establishment sounded like something I cannot keep walking past without checking out.  Of course, my friend and I opted for bottomless and were definitely surprised (and excited) to see that we could chose from not only bloody Mary's and mimosas but also margaritas, Bellinis, and caipirinhas!!  Let me tell you, the cocktails here are delicious, not overly sweetened, and STRONG!  Our server was very attentive with our drinks.  He was constantly checking in to see if we wanted another or wanted to try something else.  Personally, I recommend the margs and caipirinhas.  (Obviously some favoritism towards lime here).The food came out shortly after ordering and when it did, my friend and I had mixed emotions.  Although it looked fabulous and tasted heavenly, the portion sizes were a bit smaller than expected.  Us girls can EAT.  Its ok though as there are a million delicious appetizers available order. The atmosphere inside is quite lively and I love how colorful the interior is.  I'll definitely be returning with a group of friends and will just make sure to have a snack before..Came here for happy hour and apps with my sister. We ordered the margarita and the mojito to drink, and the yucca fries, salmon croquettes, and ceviche.By far the winner was the yucca fries. Those were very well done and the sauce was great. Everything else food-wise though was average. The mojito and margarita were slightly below average, they really tasted like cheap drinks you get at a dive bar.The croquetas were decent, but the portion was a bit small. The ceviche was fine, but again, expectations fell a bit short.Service was very friendly, no complaints there, but probably won't return unless I'm craving yucca fries..10/10 my favorite boozy brunch in NYC. I've been here rain, shine, 11am, 3pm, sat deep inside, under the covered patio, and outside, with my dog, with a big group. What these guys do in spades is: - provide delicious, good quality Cuban food (I'm born and raised in Florida and it's all satisfactory)- provide excellent, laid back service - provide options to mix things up without feeling like your server is going to hate you. They don't mind substitutions (Madura instead of a side salad). They don't mind if you want to switch up your brunch drinks. They're happy to bring a few empanadas at the end of your meal to keep munching. I love coming here because every time I do (10+ times now), I leave full, happy and really quite drunk. I never feel like my server is pushing me out the door, I know I've definitely ran over my time before and they aren't rude. Frankly the value is so ridiculously good, and I appreciate how kind and accommodating they are, I always tip 30% plus. I love taking visiting friends here, I love starting a Sunday funday off here. Basically, if you're looking for a great brunch spot that's a little different than your standard pancakes and mimosas come here!!!.After two long years, I have returned to the place where I had the best Steak and Eggs of my life. My girlfriend and I tried the Beef Empanadas and they were amazing. They come with two house sauces that are very good. Management should really consider selling the spicy house sauce because it was next level.I decided to try the Cuban Sandwich this time and it was very satisfying. It was a good size, the flavor was there, and it's overall a very enjoyable dish. My girlfriend had the Steak and Eggs and she liked the dish pretty well. I had some - I must say it didn't quite live up to the plate I had before but it was still pretty good. Now that I live in New York, we will most definitely be back sooner than later..I had brunch here back in July 2019, but that meal is often on my mind. This was the best breakfast I've ever had in my life. I had the Steak and Eggs (scrambled with cheese) and it was just heavenly. It was a lot of food for the price as well. I haven't been back because I was only visiting but I definitely will be returning..This place looks so cool. Prime location, great space, fire tunes, and nice vibes. The photos of the food look unreal. And come on, worst case, you can just get a cuban sammy. Those are always delicious. But if was kind of disappointing. My cuban came out and gosh darnit did it look scrumptious. And then, to my horror, it was kinda bland yall. The atmosphere was so nice it pains me to write these words. The pickle and the cheese didn't compliment each other. I tasted the mustard, but again, just kinda bland.My girlfriend got the steak sammy, and that was actually pretty good IMO. Steak was great, sauce was great. And all the menu items look so tasty but I hope they have a little more flavor than that sandwich. Would go back for brunch. Bottomless brunch looks like a hoot there..Came here on a Sunday morning for brunch with a group of friends. I ordered the Cuban Eggs Benedict ($17), which consisted of Poached Eggs, BBQ Pulled Pork, Ham, Hollandaise Served with Mixed Greens. Overall a pretty tasty and filling meal. I also got a glass Mango Bellini ($13). Pretty standard NYC pricing for a mixed drinks. They do have a 90 minute bottomless brunch which is super worth it if you're planning on having 3 or more drinks for $28.Service here is super lax. If you don't like someone bugging you every 15 minutes how things are, this is your place. With that said, you'll most likely have to wave down a staff member to get their attention, which can get annoying for someone who ordered bottomless and in need of a refill.FYI: There is a COVID surcharge of 8%..AMAZING SPOT FOR BIG GROUP BRUNCH!I had made a reservation at 6 pm on Friday for the following Saturday, and they were super accommodating for our group of 20+ (even willing to change the time when we realized not everyone was free at the original time; and also shifting our ""start time"" for bottomless brunch back because we had come later than expected).They fit 20+ people by lining up ~10 small tables in their outdoor seating. I think any more people and they would have had to curve the seating (create an L-shape), but I think it would still work well if you have a slightly bigger group size.Food: I got the Cuban eggs benedict - very yummy!! We also got apps to share: guac, mixed seafood calamari, and french fries. The calamari came with a spicy-ish orange sauce on the side that was delicious.Drinks: we did the bottomless brunch which is ~$28/pp + you must order an entree (~$15-$20 pre-tax). I think service was a bit slower because we had a large group size, but we still managed to order 3 drinks without being chased out at all when our 90 minutes were up. The servers were all so accommodating for the big group and we all got the food/drinks we ordered :D"
"I really wanted to love this place but it wasn't for me. The Decor at this place is amazing and great for taking pictures but I'm afraid the dishes I tried did not taste good.The steak tacos had a stench that I could not make out. I need up forcing myself way through one just to get a feel of it. In my opinion, it tasted like nothing, pretty bland in my opinion so I had to down it in sauce but I still couldn't get past the smell so I ended up throwing it away.Esquites have become one of my favorite Mexican sides but this one did not do it for me. The corn had no taste and felt like it was sitting in microwaved water all day.The best part of my meal was the drink.Stopped in for a quick bite during shopping at IC.This is the first time I've actually dined at a restaurant in IC. They do have a nice selection of "" street food"" tacos.They also have Tortas  which sounds delicious and weekly specials.I just chose a simple taco where  protein like chicken, pork, etc can be added.The grilled chicken taco was tasty with onions, cilantro, cucumber, radish and served with a  side spicy green sauce.The taco was tasty but the cucumber should be diced.It does come with 2 pieces of taco wrap.The grapefruit jarrito  was refreshing.Courteous service and cool Latin music.I was surprised my small order was packed in a big brown paper bag.. seems a bit wasteful.There are long communal tables to dine at and you can eat safely( social distancing)..Mouthwatering tacos in the frolicsome setting of industry city. A little different now since before the pandemic but still very good. I do miss the strawberry aioli and access to the salsa / radish / cucumber bar. For a normal sized stomach, definitely order 3 tacos. They come with two tortillas each as well. I recommend the chicken tinga taco and the mushroom taco which comes with a hearty amount of cheese. The 3 tacos also come with a side of green and red salsas and cucumber and radish. Can eat indoors at the many seating arrangements or outdoors in the quirky, heated courtyard. Specials on the menu every day!.Tried the birria pizza and it is not really pizza. It is more like a large birria quesadilla (""pizza crust"" is tortilla). It was large in size and had tons of birria meat & toppings. It got soggy quickly, but it was quite tasty esp with the cheese in it. I don't know if I would reorder this, but I will stick to reordering the birria cheese tacos! YUM!.Wow! I was eating a doner kebab at Kotti's and then saw there was a taco shop next door. I saw birria and knew I had to try it! I ordered the birria taco with queso, shrimp tostado and a pina colada slushy. Man oh man! I was surprised how good everything was! The birria with cheese taco was divine! The birria meat was so tender and juicy and tasted as good as birria landia's & the tortilla was crispy and soft! And the good thing is that I can just come here to eat the birria taco without traveling to queens! The taco doesn't come with consomme but it was that damn good! The shrimp tostado was so fresh, crunchy and man that shrimp was so well seasoned! The pina colada slushy was so delicious and fresh!Highly recommended! I will be coming back soon!P.S - they have daily specials & a birria pizza too!.Taco shop in the food hall of industry city. They have a special everyday of the week and it happen to be tostada day. We got the shrimp tostada which was good, but I would def recommend the birria con quest tacos and the Pina colada slushy. The birria tacos were so good and this was the first time I saw it with cheese. The meat was moist and tender, the tortilla crunchy and soft at the same time..I was between a 3.5 or 4.  This is a small place with seating across the hall indoors or outside.   They are open later than a lot of places in Industry City, which is great.  I enjoyed the cute, modern decor, and taco dirty to me wall.  I've been here twice.  The first time was busier.   I definitely have had better tacos.  But their flavors were on point and food tasted fresh.  Don't be fooled by their drink as it didn't have any alcohol.  The quesadilla was stuffed with meat and delish..The tacos are soooooo gooddd!! Especially the shrimp tacos. Only reason why I'm putting 3 stars is because of the service. I order from here on DoorDash and after confirming my DoorDash order and then preparing my order and making my dasher go all the way there and making him wait, they canceled my order 9 minutes before they closed. To add on I was at work, I work 12 hours a day and this was supposed to be my lunch. It's really upsetting when you are so busy that you had no time to order food earlier in the day, then you finally order and you wait an entire hour for this food to come and they cancel once the dasher is there and waiting. This is the second time this happened. And I don't know what the issue is each time but they need to do better. Especially when they are canceling an order an entire hour later without warning or giving a reason. That's exactly how you lose customers. At this point I'm not sure I want to order from here again because they are not dependable. (This is for sunset park Brookly location by the way, for some reason it keeps taking me to industry city location every time I click sunset park).They've definitely taken a hit with COVID since there's not a lot of foot traffic. However the food is good and a reasonable price. I would recommend not doing the $20 deal for 3 tacos and a drink unless you're getting more expensive tacos because if comes out cheaper to buy the tacos separately then maybe get a drink somewhere else. I loved their ""Red Taco"" and would highly recommend it if you go..Best food and price in the wasteland of overpriced places in Industry City. We got the combo for 20 bucks which included 3 tacos of our choice, a side (we got a healthy serving of rice and beans) AND a drink. We got a sizable sangria which was good. We shared the combo and were totally pleased. Will definitely try again..I got the taco combo. $21 for 3 soft tacos, a side and a drink. Everything tasted fine, but it was super small portions. You can walk 3 blocks abs pay the same price at any taqueria in the neighborhood and get 3x's the food. Too many great taco joints in Sunset Park to waste your time on this place."
"Came here on a Sunday and was lucky to be treated by Michelle the bartender - she was so lovely and warm, welcoming, etc. Truly a fantastic person and should be recognized for that. I'll be trying to contact them separately to let them know bc she genuinely deserves praise. Michelle's drinks (I got martinis) were fantastic. She was an excellent bartender. Exactly as I wanted them prepared - and I'm picky when it comes to my martinis!!The food was unfortunately just okay - the fries were good but the boneless chicken wings were bland and I found both of the sauces to be too spicy without much flavor to back them up. With that said, I ordered everything off the happy hour menu so it was like half price. Would I come back? Def not during regular hours but happy hour sure..Picked up some takeout the other day and was pleasantly surprised.  The reviews are all of the place for this location, but it's so convenient being located right on 84th and Broadway, it's right in between my sons apt and my hotel. Tuna Poke nachos came packed with lots of fresh Tuna, tomatoes, avocado, Hints of fresh lime, ginger and soy sauce it comes in a separate container so the fresh chips don't get soggy.  This dish was surprisingly good.Roasted Brussel Sprouts take the prize! These were to die for!  Sautéed in a Thai vinaigrette, with peanuts and sprinkled with red chili flakes.  These are totally worth a try.Everything was packed nicely including silverware and napkins.   The menus pretty extensive for s burger place. A nice choice of good salads, and creative burgers.  I heard the impossible burger is amazing.  I'll be back and the have nice outdoor seating with heaters..Delicious is all I can say! We ate indoors Saturday night. They checked our temperature and got our details for covid tracing notifications. The dividers were tall and surrounded the booth we were in. My toddler was provided with crayons and paper to keep him entertained. It was a few days after Thanksgiving but they were still offering the 'Thanksgiving on a bun' burger. A mouth watering sausage stuff turkey burger with tillamook cheese, caramelized onions, sweet potato and cranberry mayo. Very quintessential! Definitely go have it next year if they offer it!We all shared the Sweet Potato Disco Fries and Tuna Poke which we all inhaled. I mean we're not picky eaters either but it was toddler approved without hesitation. My husband had the 5 Napkin Burger, we all had shared bites of each other's burgers. Go eat here! We loved it for a casual, good night out!.Delicious is all I can say! We ate indoors Saturday night. They checked our temperature and got our details for covid tracing notifications.

We loved it for a casual, good fare outing!.Cute place but the food is overly priced and not even tasteful to be the prices they are.  I went to this spot only to waste time until the movie started (since the movie theater is across the street from here) & what a mistake.  I could of just went to get a slice and enjoy that more then here.  I bought onion rings, a patty melt, fries and a cheddar bacon burger..... the total being in the 70's!  That's crazy!.This is my second time at a 5 Napkin Burger location...I do not know what it is, but I feel like the burgers are missing a little something! The burgers are just bland. The service was not there. Guest who arrived after us were greeted and attended to immediately... not us! After I brought it to someone's attention, I was getting better service.... Awkward!!! The only thing good about this visit was the rum punch... It came in a nice cup. Good job bartender!.Who says Monday is the worst day of the week? Not me! Especially when this Monday kicked off the start of restaurant week in NYC. It's a great time to check out some places that you've had bookmarked for a while at a lesser price. Though some menus are a bit limited I'm sure these something for everyone. My first stop was 5 Napkin Burger on the upper west side. The restaurant menu option includes your choice out of 10 burger options , a drink and a side of crinkle, sweet potato or corn battered waffle fries for $21 dollars before tax.I chose the Bacon Cheddar Burger with the Corn batter waffle fries and a lemonade as my drink. Here's a tip mention the restaurant week menu or you will pay full price as it not listed on there website or QR code ordering option. I also ordered the watermelon margarita because it was a hot day. The drinks came first. The watermelon marg started off good but towards the middle all I could taste was salt so I didn't finish it. The food game out fresh and hot! The burger was cooked just how I liked it medium well and was juicy. Nobody likes a dry burger. I think my favorite part of the meal was the corn battered waffle dries. I've never had it prepared like that and it was crispy and warm. Dare I say better than Chic Fil A fries. I would come back just for those because I couldn't get enough.Definitely try this place out. I left with a full stomach..Wonderful experience! Kudos to the manager, Greg- for first being a great person in general and expecting the same from his team! We ate at the bar, and Michelle made sure we were taken care of 100 percent- I suggested you get the toasted pineapple margarita, those hatch chili fries and the impossible burger! Delicious!!!! I can't wait to go back! Greg.. Texas, loves you! Bless your heart!.Ordered the Super Bowl wings and chips package and was very impressed with the presentation, the instructions and the adherence to delivery time I had requested! Another win for 5 Napkin - a solid choice for eat in and take out on the UWS.We were pleased by how quickly they were able to seat us even when it was quite busy in a Friday night. The contactless menu was nice and the server was kind! We both got salads. I got the Original with the veggie patty ontop and my friend got the kale salad with a turkey burger. I am not going to lie I wish I got hers instead of mine but it was still a good dinner. I would recommend the KALE salad over all the salads!! Great clean place with a fun family vibe while serving older ages with the bar..Photo doesn't say it all, Double 8oz Cheese Burger with a little bacon hit the spot! don't let the photo fool you ! this place always had the best burgers in the UWS! my mouth dropped when i saw the melted cheese and the smell of the beef ! it's a little pricey but well worth it!"
"One of my longtime favorites! My sister gets me a cannoli or red velvet cake almost every year for my birthday from here. I haven't stepped inside in  a couple of years. So we stepped in and I couldn't help myself. Everything is so beautiful and tasty! And extremely affordable! A mini cheesecake, two raspberry macarons, two mini cannolis, and a slice of chocolate mousse cake all for $14!!.I'm not a cannoli person but this place converted me. A friend brought a box of the chocolate and vanilla cannolis and they were delicious. The filling is a rich ricotta with chocolate chips. The shells have a nice amount of cinnamon to balance out the creme. Really beautiful presentation too, I loved receiving these.Cake for lunch! Once you enter, everything smells amazing and all the sweet scents collide. I walk in knowing what I want but then I see all the mouth watering options and reconsider! I enjoy coming here when I have a sweet tooth especially after the gym. Other than their cheesecake cupcakes, my favorite is their tiramisu! It is very light, soft and fluffy. The 'tiramisu' tag is so cute and made from white chocolate I think. The red velvet on the other hand can get a little dense but is still satisfying. I like their packaging. Your favorite Italian/American desserts are here. Cannoli trays, cookie trays and more. By the way, they don't accept card, cash only!I can't wait to try their cookie trays..This place is pretty hit and miss. The sandwich cookies tend to be on the stale side.. The cannolis are perfection, there's a tiramisu cup that is sinfully tasty and the chocolate mousse cake is melt in your mouth delicious BUT.... when they're bad? Omg it is epic.A few weeks ago I ordered raisin cinnamon rugelach and they were amazing! I ordered the same thing a few days later, except I also added an order of the raspberry rugelach. This time the raisin cinnamon rugelach were some horrible bready things with barely a raisin to be seen and no taste. Disgusting. However, the raspberry ones were awesome. Yesterday I ordered 3/4 lb of the raspberry rugelach. I paid $14.95 and received 4. FOUR!!! That's $3.74 for each one!!! What?!?! The crazy thing is that when I ordered less raspberry rugelach, I got more than I did yesterday. I just can't stand the inconsistency. My advice, definitely give this bakery your business, just stay away from the cookies and anything they sell by weight..I ordered the strawberry cheesecake twice.....first time was on a whim...so what had happen was...I forgot the person's birthday and found this bakery on Ubereats. It's her fav kinda cake.  We had a quick celebration. She had no idea....about the cake or me forgetting The second order was a week after for my sister's birthday.... another cheesecake fanatic ‍.Both times the cake was perfect..... strawberries were FRESH, LARGE and SWEET....The cake itself was not too sweet. Personally, I'm fine with one slice a year and I approve. In fact,  the cheesecake lovers previously mentioned, approved!....Wow! So happy to have stumbled upon this place after taking my grandparents to get their second vaccine in the neighborhood. So many scrumptious looking treats to choose from!! I ended up deciding on the carrot cake and the assortment of macaroons. The carrot cake was moist on the inside and PERFECT -- not too sweet or butter creamy. Haven't had a bOmb carrot cake since Lloyd's Carrot Cake up in the Bronx. I'm impressed and can't wait to try their other sweet offerings!.Ordered 4 slices at work for a friend for her bday. Delicious cake, fast delivery, great options. Would recommend! Tried the chocolate mousse cake slice, Tiramisu slice, Italian cheesecake and strawberry graham cracker ganache--Can't pick a favorite slice, all were great! Friend was happy.Disrespectful and disgraceful isn't even the word! FYI to anyone who supports or follows their Instagram page don't even bother supporting this business at all because  they will randomly block your page for no reason! Even if you like their pictures or support their business they will block your page  for no reason Who even does that? That's so unprofessional and RUDE. And by the way not impressed with their foods at all I was considering going here when I travel to New York again but never mind I will never respect business owners who act like assholes and don't respect people. Or treat people with respect and I know many people in different businesses specifically in nyc and that business owner is beyond rude. To hell with you and your bullshit.  I will never support your foods or business when I come to New York where a lot of my businesses are FYI. And lastly Up yours!.They are a hit or miss. Some days cakes are fresh some days they taste old and are disgusting. I wish they would just not sell old baked goods. I've tried the tres leches, Oreo slice, strawberry cheesecake, and a few other slices. And to make it worse my family ordered me a vanilla birthday cake from here that was delivered to my home in the morning. It looked so beautiful but it was the oldest driest cake I've ever had. Just go to the supermarket and get an Entenmann's boxed cake or a Bjs cake for a birthday gift. Not worth the gamble anymore, I've moved to Carvel down the block when I want something sweet..Glad I found this local Italian bakery because my son is obsessed with rainbow cookies And I used to literally drive all the way to Bay ridge just to get him some. But luckily my spot is walking distance from my place and I'm able to get them for him. I had a slice of their tiramisu and it was OK not the best , I wouldn't purchase it again. Only reason why I didn't give them a full 5 star is because it's cash only and a little inconvenient in 2021 when Almost everyone walks around with little change in their pockets and their card. Other than that the rainbow cookies are really Delicious and the staff is very friendly."
"I have had this catered in, and the bagels/cream cheese are standard (not bad), and also I liked the banana bread enough (because it was not very banana-forward) but surprisingly the standout was the sandwiches. The turkey/bacon sandwich was good and refreshing, but the true STAR was the roast beef. Full of tender, decadent, fatty roast beef that did have me alternate bites with the other sandwich because it was so rich.I have yet to try the donuts still...one day..Excellent little bakery on the UES. I love carbs and dream about carbs and definitely went a bit crazy in the store. Here's what we tried: 1) morning spelt. Bread loaded with raisins, sunflower seeds and quinoa. So dense and hearty. Excellent with some butter or just on its own. 2) green olive zaatar sticks. Lots of olives inside but didn't think it was all that amazing. 3) raisin pumpernickel. Rye bread with raisins. Really good but I prefer the morning spelt. 4) banana walnut bread. Fresh and yum. Loaded with banana flavor. 5) sprouted grain bread. Very crunchy on the outside and chewy inside. Loaded with good for you seeds Tasted so healthy 6) Roasted Onion Focaccia Pull a Part. Didn't think this was all that impressive. 7) Whole Sticky Bun Babka. my favorite item from the store so far! Super buttery and soft with sweet pecan goodness on top! It did came with a hefty price of $17 bucks for a small loft however. 8) everything bagel. Good bagel but no scallion cream cheese? :( Overall, this is a decent spot. Definitely pricey but overall worth it IMO. The ladies who served me were friendly besides the woman who made the bagel..Fantastic chocolate chip cookies - maybe the best... need to do more research. I will come here more often to discover more but... there is some pain involved - all of which has been mentioned. Price: high. Attitude from customers: omg. Employees: maybe they are too busy, but they could use more patience. I want to try the sandwiches, bagels, breads, and probably everything else. I'm in..Sunday afternoon. Looked great inside!  Food was displayed well. We ordered 3 donuts; Lemon curd, red raspberry and black raspberry - donuts were bland & dry. Lemon curd was watery. Red raspberry had seeds & sour, black raspberry was lack luster. Also had 1 mini B&w cookie. StaleIced chai and small latte w/oat milk were good. Overpriced and not good. Looks are deceiving..My friends love cookies from Orwashers so much. They brought us a couple of times and we finally had a chance to visit there. The options were in a great variety and the staff was friendly. We got a slice of Sticky Roll Babka, one Almond Croissant and 2 packs of Granola. The price was decent and the portion was reasonable as an artisan bakery. We love the Almond Croissant, the filling was creamy with crispy layers, it was amazingly delicious. The Babka wasn't our type, the walnut was off-balanced in proportion with the Babka itself in our opinion. The granola was also good, which was baked properly with plenty of different ingredients..Terrific breads and pastries here!Been in business for over 100 years and still cranking out the delicious baked goods they are known for.Had a giant flaky croissant today, along with an amazing morning bun. Both delicious. Also picked up a loaf of bread which they sliced for me.Friendly service. Reasonable prices. Tasty hot coffee too. Worth an early morning visit to start the day.Not the place to go if you're dieting or watching that carb intake!.I tried their Green Eggs and was quite disappointed, since I'd heard good things about this bakery.It was very bland. The avocado and eggs had no flavor and you could barely taste the cheese. (And this is coming from someone who is not into strong flavors)They have a great variety of breads, so I'd like to try something else, but not ordering this again and wouldn't recommend it..This is a cute little shop that has an amazing window display of sandwiches and sweet goodies, along with breads and coffee. I thought the bagels were just ok. They didn't seem very fresh and they were not properly toasted. They were also pretty doughy and not enough cream cheese. But not terrible. I will say, I wish the staff was nicer. They were quite rude to us actually, I wouldn't come back here just because of that. There are some tables outside to sit which is nice, someone should clean them more often..Orwashers Upper West Side Orwashers Bakery is well over 100 years in business. I've lived on the Upper West Side and now on the Upper East Side and purchased their baked products at both locations for years. They supply their delicious breads to local eateries too. I've never had a meal at this location. I'm buying my breads and pastries and leaving. I do prefer the location on the Upper East Side. They have given me a free sample to try before I purchase. So far my favorite is their Black and White Cookie. The loaves of bread are excellent too. It's all good! I'm recommending if you visit NYC you stop in for a muffin, cookie, or croissant. You won't be disappointed..These bagels are incredible. They are the perfect size, the right amount of chewiness, and have an excellent flavor. I can't believe reviews are not all 5 stars for this place!"
"Their food is consistently great and portions are generous enough to bring home leftovers..LOVE the backyard patio because the dining sets make you feel like you're eating in someone's backyard - such homey, summery vibes. We came by for brunch on a beautiful Saturday a few weeks ago and there was only one other family that ate at the picnic tables. I loved the privacy & intimacy. The only downside is that there is a playground on the other side of the fence so it got pretty loud with screaming kids at one point... but what can ya doApps were great - Lab Rolls ($8.50 for 5) complimented the fresh Papaya Salad ($10.50) which packed some heat! We also ordered a side called Kai Pra Atit ($6) -- it's essentially fried eggs with rice cooked inside of it. Never had anything like it before, but worth the try! For mains we got Drunken Noodles w/ chicken ($13) and Massaman Curry w/ Boneless Beef Short Ribs ($19). Both very delicious as well.I thought my thai iced tea ($4.50) was a bit too artifically sweet but my boyfriend's thai iced coffee ($4.50) was perfect. Our bill totaled $72 before tip, which I initally thought was a bit pricey... but we did order quite a lot. Our server was great, checking up on us pretty often throughout the meal. Hopefully we'll return before it starts getting cooler outside..This place is great for take out. The food is always really good. Decided to stop by for a sit in meal and granted the food was still good the service was all over the place. It must've been a bad day because apparently there were no mangers on the premise and a bunch of new hirers were left to fend for themselves. There was a full blown argument between the staff at one point. They forgot an entire entree that we ordered, refused to cancel/change a drink order and the inside of our curry puffs were still cold among other things. Hope it was just a fluke or the result of a holiday weekend because the food is good and they have a great patio space out back. One star off for a possible bad day....Delicious Pad See Ew! It was bursting with flavor, and they gave me a good amount of chicken. I had to hold myself back from finishing the entire plate--it was one of those conundrums where you're super full but want to keep eating. My friend also told me their drink menu is really yummy, so I definitely want to come back to try some of their drinks!They also have a super cute backyard for outdoor seating! The tables are cute and the decor is really colorful and lively. They also have umbrellas to shade you from the sun, the rain, or anything in between.I took off one star because the staff was a bit sharp with us. They seemed to be in a huge hurry and talked at us very pointedly even though we were the only customers in the restaurant. We felt awkward every time we interacted with them. Perhaps they were just having an off day. The food was excellent, though!.Such a cute place! Ample outdoor seating for a summer day with delicious and hearty plates of fresh noodles, rice, and vegetables. I ordered the vegetable pad Thai and kao pad. Both were so filling and the servings were huge! Lots of vegetables too but a bit oily. Oddly enough, our food came out at pretty different times for a party of 4. I enjoyed a Thai tea milk tea and honeydew milk tea with boba. You can order a size regular or a large. My friend recommends the beer by the bottle. They also have beer on tap. Bathrooms available and very casual atmosphere..So good!! I'm not a huge fan of americanized thai food and it has been a struggle to find authentic Thai food in the city but this place met all my expectations. We had the laab, green curry and their thai tea. Everything was very good and the decor was nice too!.Came to Corthaiyou for an event. It was originally supposed to be held in their outdoor seating area, but was moved indoors due to inclement weather. I'd say they were very generous about closing the restaurant for a couple hours just for us, but it did feel very rushed.The party started off with everyone receiving a sample platter of Curry Puff, Chive Pancake, and Spring Roll. There was a list of entrées to choose from and I ordered the Tofu Pad Kee Mao. For dessert, everyone was served Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice.Overall, the food tasted pretty good but it was a bit overpriced. If I find myself in this area again I would probably come back, but not worth the drive all the way from NJ..I wanted to love this place, as I start all the companies I review with a 5, and it's in a beautiful location.The food is OK. Overpriced and very small portions. For example while the vegetable dumplings were good, $8.50 for tiny dumplings is highway robbery.The customer service was OK.Abrupt. Not helpful.In a neighborhood with other options, those other options may be your best option..Spring has Sprung!It was a gorgeous day out and what a better way to celebrate than Thai!Happened to be in the area and Yelp led me here! It wasn't packed and there was space in the back patio.  I'd say the back needed a pick me up as far as decor. I didn't understand the aesthetics. Service was ok. We had to ask a few times for things. We were still eating appetizers and they brought the food out , which didn't make sense as it had to sit out while we finished. The drinks were pretty  but not strong.  They don't sell hard liquor so don't expect to get tipsy here. The food was good. The sriracha wings were tasty and crispy. I got shrimp pad see ew and it was good . Not a bad spot for dinner. Not too pricey. Hope they can fix up the back better..Personally this place is so good. We came here because the name of the restaurant. The available dessert of the day was coconut pudding. Came in three little circle dish, it was warm and topped with crispy (fried?) coconut flakes. Gotta try it!I ordered Pad See Ew i asked for spicy, and with shrimp.The flavor was intense and everything blends well together. Each bite of noodle with vegetable or shrimp just made me so happy.He ordered Pad Kee Mao, aka drunken noodle with chicken. For some reason mine was way spicer than his and drunken noodle are suppose to be spicy. Not complaining though, he thought it was delicious.We had spring rolls as appetizer, 3/5 because portion and filling was lacking seasoning.Thai ice tea is good, he got honeydew milk tea. Milk tea bubble is a 2/5 because the texture of bubble could've been better."
"Second visit to Dos Caminos. Nini was our server today. She did not disappoint. Great suggestions. Great service. Very attentive. Have to say this is turning into one of my favorite spots..Went into Dos Caminos with some friends for something new. I had my reservations with it being in times square. Our server, Jason, explained menu items perfectly. Surf and turf tacos, empanadas and guacamole were excellent. All suggested by Jason. The ambience was great. Lighting was great. Not too loud. Had good conversation with having to get closer. Cadillac margaritas were so good I asked the name of the bartender. So thank you Jason and Kevin. Definitely coming back soon..Dos Caminos never disappoints! Maria was very attentive. She made our drinks extra strong and the chicken quesadilla and tacos truly hit the spot after walking 20k steps today. 10/10 would recommend..Long time fan of Dos Caminos, but it's been awhile. Came to the Broadway location with friends and had an awesome experience. Ask for Jason G. - took great care of us and our kids!.In the heart of Times Square, this was a welcoming respite from all the tourist friendly restaurants in the area like TGI Fridays or Red Lobster. I came here with a friend around 4:30pm and there were no tables available without reservations (kind of odd...) so we opted for a table downstairs in the lounge. The lounge area was somewhat crowded with some semi loud music, but we were still able to have a conversation.We got margs and some chips and salsa to share. The chips is a very generous portion, enough for 3 or 4 people to share. I liked the trio of sauces that came with the chips. The salsa isn't the typical chunky tomato kind, but more of a thin runny sauce. They ranged from mild to hot. Warning: the ""hot"" one is pretty hot. Margs were slightly pricer than I expected (and could have been stronger for that price) but for the location I guess it was to be expected. Our waiter was very friendly and service was prompt and I was pleased with how fast our drinks came. If you happen to be the area for whatever reason, this is a good go-to for after Broadway drinks or dinner..Dos Caminos was attached to the hotel we were staying at in Time Square. I had scheduled lunch time reservations but arrived from the airport earlier than expected. They were still able to accommodate my reservation. What was originally a reservation for 7 people turned out to be a reservation for 12 people. The restaurant was still willing to work with us and accommodated our large party while only have one server. I believe his name was Oscar. He had the pretty acrylic nails. He was so nice. His service was so fast. I know he was overworked because he admitted to me that they were short staff and that he was the only waiter at that time. Let me tell you, his service was still outstanding. I couldn't even tell they were short staff with the amount of people piling in.The food was also really good. I will definitely be back here when I come back to NYC..We came to Dos Camino before our Broadway show. We had a nice lunch that filled us up till the evening. They had a passion fruit margarita, so you know I had to give it a try. My husband went with the Dos Mojito. To start, we went with the empanadas de platano. They were scrumptious! My husband ordered the Baja tacos and I ordered a chicken Cobb salad. Everything was delicious and will definitely return in the future..The new Al Pastor tacos are super good, so is the tuna ceviche. We had Ela who made our experience top-notch and fun. Nice vibe downstairs..Don't need a reservation on a busy day. Good food I would recommend the asada quesadilla. Thanks to Jesus we had a great experience. Would come back again if visiting NYC.Enjoyed this restaurant twice this week as its located close to our hotel. Tried the small guacamole and dos enchiladas the first time and the chicken quesadillas with chipotle bbq sauce and crema this evening wit the mojito. Both evenings were delightful and service was good.  Very flavorful..Great place great food great service. Amazing blood orange margaritas a must visit. A must do in Manhattan. Bartender was wonderful and very attentive."
"I really love this bar! So cozy and the karaoke aspect makes it so much fun and laidback. Bartenders are really sweet folk. Please note the hours on google or yelp might not be updated. As of Jan 2022 they are open every single day from 2pm - 2am! 10/10 recommend to come here to chill and have a good drink :) Thanks Montero for being my favorite neighborhood bar after moving to Brooklyn!.$15 for a simple beefeater soda and the old guy with suspenders who maybe owns the place is berating a female bartender while hitting on a patron.  Super gross. Don't recommend.This one star is simply for the bartender with the black bob. Had a fantastic night with my friends sitting at the bar until she accused us of not tipping. We were being served all night by another bartender, and tipping on every order. I have zero reason to lie about that as i've grown up in the service industry and know that bartenders and servers rely on tips. She was talking about us behind the bar and refusing to serve us. Incredibly unfortunate as we were having a great time up until this point..Went to this bar for the first time on Wednesday and had the best time! Iconic decor , old school dive and all around great energy. Bartender was fantastic and attentive ! Both crowd and music was lively! Will definitely be going back and telling anyone that wants to have a good time to join hehe.Montero's! Karaoke with AMETHYST (lovely host with killer vocals). Need I say more.A friend of ours was having a birthday and we had to trek it do some hidden bar in Brooklyn Heights. My friend described this place as ""aquatic themed"" and a ""dive"". Two of my favorite words when combined together. I salivate at the thought of an old man bar and then you put karaoke in the mix  like the cherry on top. We arrived around 9pm. Turns out this was the smartest move. Later I saw groups of people and even birthday people get turned away by the charming door guy ""Pepe"" while ""Matthew"" tried to woo me. The karaoke is done in the tiniest part of the bar. I suggest you'd stand in an angle to let people go to the bathroom but also leave room for ""Sonya"" to bus tables and get to the bar and still see the karaoke list. Back to Amethyst. You gotta write down the song you want to sing. If it's not in the computer then Amethyst will call you back to put in a new song. You get a song with every drink you order. If you are doing a duet then you hand the mic to the person who's being invited to sing. This is the rule. The name on the slip is the person that hands the mic.  Don't forget. The main mic has the red tape. DON'T PUT DRINKS DOWN ON AMETHYST'S TABLE. At the bar, Kaddy is slinging drinks but will take a quick break to sing some Alanis Morisette. Everyone here is down for the wild ride!The beers are $4 for pbr and with a tequila shot it's $11. So pick your liquid courage wisely.This place is over 80 years old. The staff was really the best part, followed by the decor. The crowd is a young, finance, fresh out of grad school types and some older regulars sprinkled in. Maybe they come on the non-karaoke nights. It's CASH ONLY. Almost $3 for the ATM..I'd have to say the bartender with the black bob was excellent. Family owned for many decades. Good people root for this bar's success. As humans working in the same direction for our collective betterment let us all remember the importance of supporting our fellow people. I have never had a negative experience here.Montero's is the coolest place you'll ever have the privilege of drinking and celebrating in. There is no ""it"" scene here or fancy flair cocktails. It's an ancient dive bar that should be a museum to honor the New York of old that disappears faster than you can snap your fingers each day.My most recent visit was an early Friday evening after work (teacher hours mind you), and it felt like all regulars in the spot. Pool table was busy, early evening news was on, jukebox was loaded up with some jams, and the owner (?) as usual posted up at the end of the bar surveying his keep.Though it wasn't crowded, for our eventually large party of about 6+, it was difficult to be seated and not feel in the way of all traffic cause the place is so narrow. That may have been a blemish for my coworkers, but I've been here on karaoke nights when it was standing room only, so my standard of measurement is skewed.Perhaps this may not be our regular after work spot cause our group rolls too large, but I will be back with my crew for Karaoke one of these evenings!And for the early couple of first round drinks with 2-3 coworkers tops? Montero's works juuuust fine, and we should be so lucky to get to experience it..Montero's is a dive that comes fully equipped with a pool table, surly bartenders and surprisingly fun karaoke nights, so please allow me to sing this review to you in the style of Bohemian Rhapsody: Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?Caught in a dive bar, to escape from reality.Open your beer, look at that weird guy, smell peeeee...I'm just a poor boy, I need some buybacks please.*Because I'm kinda drunk, OK sloshed. Little high? Maybe so.Anything the 'tender pours, doesn't really matter to me, to me...Oh man, just sang a song.Put my mouth up on the mic, yelled my chorus, now they left.To think, the night had just begun.But now I've gone and chased them all away...My bad, ooh, didn't mean to make you leave,If I'm here back again this time tomorrow,Get me help, the AA kind, 'cause I definitely have a problem.Too late, my drink has come.Sent shots all down my throat, think I should've got my coat.Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go.Gotta leave you all behind and eat some food,**Really, ooh, (anything that tastes good)I don't want to leave,But sometimes I wish I'd never come in at all.[Guitar solo fades out because I think this has run its course.]_____________*The prices are definitely a little higher than they should be, considering the smell and the man sleeping in the corner that you might think is homeless, but is actually just waiting for karaoke to start (he has a lovely voice). **They don't serve any, but Table 87 is quite close and delicious..Montero's is a neighborhood staple. It's as old school as it gets - like something out of Last Exit to Brooklyn.Come here for the karaoke machine, stay for the cheap beers.Cash only!Oh, and if you and your bros decide to sing Wagon Wheel, I'm going to throw something at you..First karaoke bar I've been to, and it was so much fun! You buy a drink, and you receive a ticket to write your name and the song you want to sing. The crowd was super encouraging, cheering everyone on as they belted their hearts out. A little bit of an older crowd. Wish I had stayed for a few more rounds."
"Zero stars This is the first and last time I order Papa Johns .They got my order wrong after waiting over an hour -I ordered hot peppers on half of the pizza -it came with the peppers on the whole pie -also they forgot my chocolate chip cookie .When I called to complain they said there was nothing they could do since I ate the pizza -We were hungry after waiting over an hour so yeah I we ate it .What were they going to do take back the pizza and sell it .Oh and the girl doesn't even know the difference between Far Rockaway and Rockaway Park...moron .My kids were so looking forward to that cookie : (.NO STARS!WE WERE JUST THREATENED BY ONE THE EMPLOYEES AT THIS LOCATION!  We ordered a pizza online, we live 2 blocks away.  An hour after placing the order my husband called to find out what was going on - no answer for 5 minutes, so he got dressed and WALKED to the location only to be told they only got the order 15 minutes earlier (bullish*t) and that it would be at our house in 10 minutes...  So we waited some more...  1.5 hours after ordering STILL NO PIZZA, so my husband called again multiple times, no answer.  Then I called from a different number and go figure they answered, no apology was offered, no refund, no discount - basically no customer service.  While on the phone being forced into a very angry state the pizza showed up at the door, my husband opened it, grabbed the pizza and shut the door (driver was pre-tipped online, BIG MISTAKE on our part).  5 minutes later our phone rings and turns up a blocked number - it's a Papa Johns employee who DOESN'T present himself as such until my husband calls him out.  This kid proceeded to yell at my husband and threaten him - warning him that he ""doesn't know who he's dealing with""...  (and this is the short version, he also lied about being a manager and refused to give his name) SERIOUSLY?  I will never order from another Papa Johns EVER.  We don't feel safe at all that some punk employee of yours had the nerve to call us and threaten us, and he has our home address!!   What kind of business is this!?  The owner of this franchise should have it revoked..Unfortunately for Papa Johns name- this place has been given a franchise and can NOT live up to the reputation. For one- I love ordering food online- maybe it is the specials or the ease - but with this store it is impossible. They do NOT honor online pricing at all - Or simply make the store unavailable for online ordering. If you by chance walk in to order - it is like walking into a scene of High School Musical without the songs - Everything is fun and games and there is absolutely no order in the store at all. In my opinion, they should take their business elsewhere- we enjoy our ""Mom and Pop"" places that have been here forever and trust they will not last- no matter how cheap they make their slices- it is not worth it at all!"
"The girl that answered the phone today June 18th 2020 was nasty and messed up my order completely..if you're having a bad day don't bring it to work clown and I'm going to express my feelings to cooperate...she should not be answering phones,I'm sure whoever is in charge knows better than too let that girl talk like that and rushing customers of the phone...the order was made at 4:30 so y'all know who was on the clock this day...I tried ordering from them. The driver called me and then blocked me. Thank God I was paying with cash!! Do not order from this establishment they are awful..Despite this establishment being dead smack in the hood amongst the rude hooligans, they have good pizza, wings and very good customer service. The owner/manager is usually there. Even when they are short staffed, they maintain very good customer service despite the rude customers. I am a very traditional pizza eater. I ordered my normal cheese pizza with chipotle wings. My phone made the wings look dark and burnt but they were perfect and delicious.  If you order here, they're wings are better than any local establishment. Juicy, flavor and never dry..This was the worst pizza I've ever had. For the first time in my life I had to actually throw a pizza out it was so bad. First of all, the app tracker is a lie, said it was delivered but arrived 30 min later. Then the delivery guy drops it off with his mask on his chin. Even then, I'm excited about pizza so I happily return to my apt and open up the boxes. It was visually dried up pizza with huge tasteless toppings. I said extra sauce but it barely had any. The jalapeño poppers were a complete joke. They had no cheese in them and one crusty dried up jalapeño in each. I wanted dominos but they didn't deliver to me so I tried papa johns but never again. Complete waste of money..The pizza I ordered was not up to my standards, even for Papa John's.  I ordered a pie with everything and the jalapeño popper rolls.  The popper rolls had some dried out jalapeño slices and no cheese at all in them, not even the ranch could help them.  The pizza was kinda dried up, and the ingredients seemed stale.  I usually live the garlic dipping sauce but that also tasted off to me.  Also the tracker is off and the delivery was late..Worst place ever !!! I'm actually contacting their corporate office they called a few minutes before my order was due to.arrive to cancel the order. This location is extremely lax regarding their closing hours. They are more likely to cancel your order than to actually do their job and deliver your paid for food. Avoid this place at all costs !!!.We ordered for delivery from this location and waited over an hour for our pizza. I understand delivery can take longer but the only reason I'm giving a bad review is because my app said the pizza had been delivered and yet no one had actually delivered the pizza. We waited for about 10 mins before we called thinking maybe the app had an issue. They stated on the phone it would be about five mins more, we again patiently waited for another ten mins and called again to get a similar response. Finally we got the delivery five minutes later. Love the pizza just was hoping for faster service or more accurate app..I placed an online order from my 14 year old son and when the food was delivered the delivery man say he can't get the food if he does t have the credit card to show him. This is a very stupid policy because what happens if the parent is not home when placing an order?! Never again!!! Terrible policy, sorry!.Average Papa Johns and delivery is good and reliable. They are only fast food chain pizza in our area so that's nice for Arverne area.I just had the worst experience trying to place an order with papa johns. I order from  this place all the time the same way. However for some reason today they did not want to send me my order. I used visa checkout to place my order (because I do not keep my physical card with me at all times). Shortly after placing the order I received a call stating I would need to show my card and I.d before I could get my order. I explained that I do not keep a physical card but I have my I.d which matches the name on my account plus I gave the guy the last 4 numbers of the account number associated with the order. I was told that it did not matter. At this time I told them to just forget it and cancel the order. The guy in the phone told me that he would ask his manager if he could complete the order anyway because I was clearly able to prove that this was in fact my account. He said he would call me back.Shortly after I received a call from Tomar the manager he simply said I cancelled your order then hung up on me!! I called back asking when I could expect my money to be returned back to my card, he replied ""I don't know bro, like 2 days I guess"" then hung up on me again.Moral of the story: I'm short 40 bucks no food for me or my Kids and I won't be ordering from you guys anymore."
"Came by super early at 3 with not much option but no other options are needed. Kareem set the vibes and helped me out check out some other spots in Brooklyn. The drinks are super reasonable and the whiskey selection is superb. If you are trying to chill and vibe come to check this place out..I dig this spot!!!Great spot that can host a large group of softball players with outdoor seating available on the sidewalk, an outdoor patio with a grill and a good amount of space and seating indoors. Respect to this place for being able to hold it down with my softball leagues season ending party. I've also been here with smaller groups and also just a friend. This bar has been an enjoyable experience each time. The bartenders are attentive and friendly. Decent selection of craft/draft beer along with wine and cocktail options. My softball league really enjoys this spot, and it sponsors a few teams so best believe I'll be showing my face more often during the season..Go here during warm weather and enjoy the good vibes. Got seated in their outdoor patio which was awesome and a cool, relaxed atmosphere. Wide array of drink selection. Got an espresso martini and some beers and enjoyed them all. Tons of people were going in and out and seemed like a Williamsburg fan favorite, and I see why. Dope spot!.Great spot to stop by for a few drinks outdoors on the street side.  Since you are required to order food with drinks, they offer some cheap $2-5 options!  Drinks are good, I had two Sazeracs ($12). Bathrooms you have to go through the garden towards the left side..Came here a couple months ago on a week night around 9pm. 3 male employees behind the bar. Only about 6 other customers in the entire bar. Place was almost empty. Bartenders kept looking at me and talking to each other but no one would come over. After 5 full minutes of us staring at each other, I waved at them (my last effort before I was just gonna leave). The guy came over and was so rude and sarcastic, wouldn't even make eye contact. Later, they went down the bar asking people if they needed another drink and skipped me with my empty glass. Left after that. Hard to ignore they were dudes being rude to one of the only women there. Got really bad vibes here, I live a couple blocks away and def not coming back..I will not be coming back to the Gibson and would never recommend it. The male bartender was extremely rude. He rolled his eyes when we ordered a certain type of drink and then mocked my friend and me. He obviously didn't think we could see him mocking us, but we could and did see it. It was completely inappropriate and uncalled for. We were perfectly nice and pleasant. Don't support this type of immature, rude male behavior..Great dive-ish bar vibe with great service! We wondered in after shopping Williamsburg for a couple happy hour beverages.The bartender was friendly and quick to help me find a local beer selection and suggest a crisp white wine for my wife! She smiled and was very pleasant which is always a huge plus in the ""big city!"" We hung out in the front window getting a plan together for other places in the community to check out on our last day in town. Restroom, bar, and seating area we selected were clean which helped us stick around for a couple drinks before heading on to the next spot.Give this spot some love next time you need a cold one after exploring Williamsburg's great shops! Cheers Y'all!.Can't say enough wonderful this about this place and the bar tenders. Alex is a gem and always so happy and accommodating! Alex and Kareem really make you feel home here..Kareem is incredible!! We had a loud bunch after softball and he was so attentive and lovely..Had a great time here. The bar itself is on Bedford, so very easy to find. If you're looking for good beer, and excellent collection of whiskey, nice people, dogs (you can bring you dog here), and an outdoor space if it's not too cold, I'd say this is the place for you. They also allow outside food. If you're very into whiskey and need some help choosing something, Walt behind the bar is really knowledgeable, friendly, and will hook you up.5/5. If you live in Williamsburg or visit, you should go..I went here for cocktails and it is a pretty standard bar. The bartenders were polite and the vibes were decent. It's definitely a neighborhood bar and a good place to grab a cocktail and hang out with friends."
"I have been craving Indian food since moving into the neighborhood from the city. I tried a few around here and they were either very expensive or the food wasn't good. This place is pretty great for my first time visit.  I ordered the chicken tika masala which was very tasty and Dahl makhani which was also very good. The rice it comes with is good too. The gentlemen behind the counter was friendly. I'll definitely come back..Ordered through Uber eats. The portions were good but the flavors were just ok. Very little to no spice. Maybe they were having an off night.The place have good food but sometimes it takes them forever to bring you your food, even when im the only one in the place, don't hear phone ringing for order smhSometimes they in the kitchen and u have to wait like 10 mins for someone to come out and take your order... u guys need to fix it.Stopped by on a Friday night for Indian pickup. A mistake.Here we go:- appy was supposed to be simple blocks of bite size cheese. I got hunks of cheese in red dye and oil withLittle taste outside of the heat- shrimp tandoori was the culprit. Shrimp dish was bordering a return trip as the shrimp were not the snap fresh texture that they should  have been. Ate'em and paid for it the entire Friday night into Saturday morning.- veggie Biryani was OK- two of the three condiments that come with most dishes were rancid. How does this happen with spiced condiments? They are salted and seasoned ... you'd have to really skirt the line on temp storage for this to go bad. Next time I'm in Woodlawn, I'll get Irish curry from the pub to satisfy my Indian craving. Will never return..Spot is decent for take out. Wouldn't say I'd travel to get here. It's in Woodlawn so when I stop by and want Indian, they get the nod..I come here a lot since moving to the neighborhood. They are very friendly, but service is slow. They accommodate for dietary needs. The naan is always perfectly crispy. The rice is just ehhh. I've asked to replace the rice with naan to which they said no, even if I were willing to pay a little extra. The saag paneer is good. The chicken tikka masala is good. The rice pudding is not like the Indian sweet rice I'm used to so I wouldn't get it again, but it might just be me..I absolutely love this place my husband and I eat out from here atleast once a week and it's consistently good. Food is always piping hot and made to order. The older gentleman who sometimes works in the back is super friendly and nice..These guys need to up their game.  I needed to give them a try as they are close and I was jonsin for quick Indian food.  I didn't know Indian food could lack flavor, but it did.  Please do better!.Ordered takeout tonight from Curry Spot. Let's start with the saying ""You get what you pay for!"" Very disappointing to say the least. We ordered Goat Vindaloo, Lamb Tikka Masala, Chicken Makhani (Butter Chicken), Shrimp Masala (appetizer), and Garlic Naan. The menu says the vindaloo is Hot I'm still waiting for some heat from the dish and only 5 chunks of goat meat. The containers for all the dishes were just sauce. The lamb and chicken had great flavoring and thankfully more meat than the vindaloo. The shrimp appetizer was also disappointing. Never have I had a restaurant serve mini shrimp, probably about 12 in the dish. Would be nice to mention they aren't full sized shrimp. The garlic naan was great. Too bad it wasn't cut before being packed in the tin foil. Won't order from here again. I'll stay with Spice Village in Tuckahoe more bang for the money..As a vegetarian I'm a big fan of Indian food.  I had a daal makni tarka asked for spicy many times when I as Caucasian order hot I get medium.  They got just right.  Courteous takeout service recommended..Omg I have never had a bad Indian food....it's really bad. I want my money back smh"
"Best Soba noodles of my life.Cash Only.Get the Mera Mera, Large, and the extra noodles.Not into sesame? Order literally any of the dipping noodles and you won't regret it.Cannot wait to come back!.Omg AMAZING! This was my first time trying soba and I can confirm that I will be coming back. Lots of seating and there was no wait for 7 pm on a Thursday evening. I got the Mera Mera Dip Soba with Chicken Thigh. The flavor was delicious, hot but not too spicy. Loved the fire that kept the soup hot for the noodle dipping. I thought it was the perfect cold day meal. I'll come back again in the spring to try the cold soba. Service was great, loved that they served soup and tea at the end of the meal! Wonderful experience, prices were very reasonable ~$20 including tax and tip!Would definitely recommend and will return soon :).This is definitely a hidden gem, a small intimate restaurant perfect for the hot and cold weather. Ever craving soba noodles but it's winter and you want the broth hot? This is the place for you. Limited seating space, so try to come with a group no bigger than 4-5, perfect for a 2 guest party. Also, very important for my credit card users like myself: *Cash Only* and another plus, they have vegan options!      For our entrees we ordered the Warm Mera Mera Soba and the Warm Japanese Styled Curry (Chicken). Let me start with the soba noodles themselves because they were made beautifully. I tasted the noodles alone and I was blown away by how perfectly they were cooked.      The Mera Mera broth was delicious and you immediately taste the kick of spice and sesame. The Japanese Curry broth was also very yummy, packed full of flavor. The broths alone are a bit salty, but dipping them with the noodles, the combo was harmonious. The broth becomes a paste like texture near the end, so they offer you boiling water to add to thin out the broth.         For dessert we got the green tea affogato. It was a cute treat consisting of green tea ice cream, red bean paste, mochi, condensed milk, corn flakes, and matcha espresso. How can you ever go wrong with green tea ice cream, red bean paste, and condensed milk?      The meal ended with the server giving us a hot cup of green tea, and it was just what I needed to digest everything down.      I absolutely loved everything I had, and you will most certainly see me back for the summer to taste their cold soba noodle and appetizers..Arrived at 1pm on a weekday and put my name down, 3 parities ahead of me. Saw the sign about cash only and quickly rushed to a nearly ATM to get cash, came back and waited till 1:20pm before getting seated. There are about 28 seats including the bar table, the restaurant size is quite small itself so the tables are quite close to each other. The menu was surprisingly broad, many different kinds of soba in cold/warm/dipping options, and they've got some interesting appetizer options too.Hijiki: A-Nicely prepared, with some sesame oil, carrots and roots, definitely tasted better than those pre-made ones getting from grocery markets.Miso Coleslaw: A-The red/purple cabbage was fresh and sweet, this was my first time having cabbage with miso sauce and actually tasted quite interesting, sourness and sweetness packed in one small dish.Mera Mera Dip: A-According to the menu it's ""rich and spicy sesame based broth"" that also contains chicken bone broth, it had a nice ground chicken aroma. They served the dipping soup in a pot with a tiny fire stove at the bottom and kept the soup boiling the whole time. It tasted kind of like miso but quite spicy, and it didn't seem like they can adjust the spiciness level. But for those that can't handle too much spicy food I highly recommend getting the yuzu topping which I did, adding yuzu into the soup really helped balancing out the overall saltiness and spiciness and adding freshness to it as well. The soba noodle was good, not the best hand made ones I've had elsewhere though. Overall, it's a decent 3.5-star soba place in general but bumping it up to 4-star because of the wide selection available, and especially in winter weather the hot boiling dipping soup is really warming!.**CASH ONLY**Okay now that that's out of the way. My friend and I visited Cocoron on a Monday at 8pm for a late dinner, which was perfect because we were able to walk in and get seated at one of their few tables (it's a pretty small space!) We both got the signature Mera Mera soba. My friend got the hot soup version, and I got the dipping version which comes with cold soba noodles and a thicker sauce-like version of the broth in a mini hot pot which is lit underneath, keeping the broth piping throughout the duration of the meal. Both our dishes were great! The Mera Mera is a sesame and chicken based broth with the slightest amount of spice and ground chicken -- super flavorful and perfect for chilly NYC winter nights. When you get the dipping soba, they provide hot broth at the end of the meal to thin out your broth, so you can have it as a soup at the end. I really appreciated this detail. Overall this was a solid soba spot with innovative flavors that I look forward to trying next time. It's small, quaint, simple, and serves a yummy bowl of noodz. What more could you ask for?P.S. You can pick between small and large for the sobas, which is a 50g difference in noodles and $1 difference in price!.Vegetable and Curry lovers rejoice!Not to be confused with Barbara Corcoran's real estate venture, Cocoron is a cozy curry restaurant on the outskirts of Manhattan's Chinatown.The Soup Curry is a Japanese concoction that is worth trying if you are feeling adventurous.  It is a lesser known cousin of the more popular Japanese boxed curry roux that many foodies already know and love.  And a must try if you are looking to add more esoteric cuisine to your palate.We both had the same item, as it was clear the menu was too vast to try everything in one visit.  This time we experienced the soup curry.  Next time maybe the other curry, the soba, or the ochazuke.Vege Vege Curry - $18All the vegetables.  Served with a choice of starch, brown rice for me.Some notes from our experience:* The spoons are awkwardly shaped and hard to use.  Diners will have soup dripping on to the table or their laps if not careful.  We noticed that even the tables next to us had difficulty using the restaurant's unique utensils.* Some tables are better than others.  There's countertop seating by the window and infront of the kitchen, but if you can secure a table, do it.  Your experience will be much more relaxed in a regular seat instead of a high chair.* Make reservations if possible.  We went the day they re-opened, so it was walk-in only.  But we were lucky to be there at 5pm and got seated immediately.  Larger groups, and those that trickled in after 6pm had noticeably longer wait times.* The area outside is on the darker side of sketchy, so I would not want to wait in line out there for longer than a few minutes.  If you ride the subway, I prefer getting off at Grand St. station and walking a few blocks north to Cocoron.  An unmasked homeless individual came into the restaurant and caused an incident, coming up to all the tables individually and asking for money, on the day we were there.  It wasn't an in and out ordeal.  The person lingered about and encroached on the personal space of several tables near one side of the room.  It took about 10 minutes for staff to help usher him out.* The location of Cocoron is not 29 Kenmare, it's 16 Delancey at the time of me writing this review.  They seem to bounce between the two shop locations every couple of months.  So feel free to call them ahead and confirm.In conclusion, you will be most comfortable visiting Cocoron as a party of 2, and no more than 4.  The particular seating arrangement and limited spots are designed this way.  The menu is very robust, and everything seems good.  So pace yourself.  Make a couple of repeat visits and experience more than one flavor of Japan..You won't get better soba in NYC. They make the soba fresh on the premises. Get the vegan warm mera mera soba if you want something super rich, otherwise the sansai soba..CASH ONLY!! Just a heads-up before you realize you have no payment method.God, I can't wait to eat here again. It was exactly what we needed on a cold night. We ordered the kimchi soba, mera mera soba, and japanese curry soba. We also had a side order of cucumbers and a round of nigori sake. Everything was absolutely delicious. The curry soup was so rich and flavorful. The noodles were also very fresh. My boyfriend said it was comparable to some of the meals he's had in Japan. Next time, I'll definitely get the dipping soba instead of having the noodles already in the broth. By the end, the noodles were a little bit soggy, but that can be remedied by getting them on the side next time. I absolutely cannot wait to come back. It'll be the perfect winter time food, for sure!.Cocoron is a cool, chill spot with good music. Whenever I come I always get the warm Mera Mera soup which is $19 for the small and $20 for a large. I got the large because why not. It is packed with flavor and has a strong yet pleasant (for me) sesame oil flavor with minced chicken, bok choy, and scallion. The soup came out extremely hot so it was a nice temperature throughout. We also got a bottle ofsake which was only $25 - every bottle here is $25. I wanted to get more appetizers in the beginning but I controlled myself. Im glad I didnt order more because I was stuffed at the end..Sometimes a rich, hot bowl of noodle soup is all you need, and I've had the good fortune of enjoying cocoron's delicious soba noodles for the better part of the last decade. There used to be two locations just blocks from each other, each very compact, with compact seating to match. I have many memories of bumping into people while in my puffy winter coat, while they're in their own puffy winter coats, all of us gingerly moving around each other as to not elbow any food off anyone's table. Now this lone location primarily serves an outdoor seated crowd, everyone hovered around one space heater, doing a similar dance.On most visits, the signature mera mera broth is what I reach for. It's a rich and spicy sesame based broth, fortified with minced tofu, bok choy, bean sprouts, scallion, and sesame. The noodles have a nice bite and the broth is deeply flavorful. On other visits, I might spring for a dipping soba dish, which feels more simple and traditional, and on hotter nights I'll opt for their cold spicy summer noodles. They have vegan options galore, and they take care with the dishes to ensure they are all packed with flavor, even without leaning on animal products to produce umami. This is a refreshing contrast to a lot of noodle soup (ramen, pho, etc) eateries who rely on meat to create flavorful broths and throw on a bland, lackluster vegan menu item as an afterthought.When vegetarian broths were more rare in the city, Cocoron was a nice haven for a reliably flavorful soup I could turn to. Now that I'm more spoiled for choice, returning to Cocoron has felt less like an event and more like a footnote, with the broth during my last visit hitting a less powerful note for me, as compared to how I good I held it up to be in my memory. Still, I'm thankful for the many cold nights I've spent warming my soul with a nice bowl of soba."
"I can't say enough good things about this place! Every single time I order the food gets to me super quick and is always hot. I get Cuban sandwiches all the time from different places and the one here is definitely the best I've ever had. The service is unmatched as well. You can tell good people work there.The items I've gotten have been delicious. The pastrami and egg sandwich is my fave. I usually get delivery through grub hub, but why is their grub hub menu so  aggressive just a bunch of ""We DO NOT do this, we DO NOT make accommodations, if you as for something we don't do WE WILL CANCEL YOUR ORDER"" why wouldn't you want to accommodate your customers, I just don't get it.This is my second time coming here and they're a great spot for a quick cup of coffee. They currently  have outdoor seating and a table by the window. There's also WiFi if you want to work from home. I usually get a dirty chai with oat milk. They also have a good selection of breakfast sandwiches. I ordered the sausage egg and cheese and it was pretty good. Service is also great. Stop by if you're in Bushwick.Fairly new to the area and stumbled across this coffee shop on a rainy summer morning. At first was looking to get away from the rain but as soon as I stepped inside was intrigued by the ambiance and the menu so decided to get some breakfast. The pastrami, egg and cheddar was super filling and flavorful, haven't had anything like it before. Will definitely be back..Quick stop for some brekky on the go. The cold brew iced coffee was fabulous. Served plain, fixings are on the side to do it yourself. Great selection of organic juices, waters, and other drinks. I ordered an bacon egg and cheese on an everything bagel, side of cream cheese. I was then informed they do not do any ""sides"" of anything. I opted to get cream cheese on the bagel with everything else. It was decently good..Fast and tasty breakfast and lunch sandwiches! The egg and cheese on brioche made my morning. The bread was fresh. The cheese was perfectly melted (and you can choose your preferred cheese). The pastrami was too salty for me, so I'll probably try another meat on my lunch sandwich next time..~BASED ON DELIVERY ONLY~I didn't have a great experience with BB the last time I ordered but wanted to give it another chance because they were so good in the beginning. I ordered a tuna melt and understandably, the sandwich was cold when I received it. However, the cheese wasn't melted AT ALL . You could see the thick individual slices of cheese just by looking at it and the bread itself had been barely toasted on one side and the other side was white, so this tuna melt was essentially cold tuna with cold cheese slapped on it that was ""toasted"" for two seconds and packaged. For the price, it was completely not worth it and made me wish I'd had gone to the store and bought the items myself, since that would've been a better experience. Unfortunately, this is the last time I will be ordering..This is absolutely one of favorite sandwich places.It is incredibly delicious and customer service is awesome!They have been open through this entire pandemic and I am so happy for them!You guys absolutely rock !Thank you for your delicious sandwiches and feeding meWith coffee ever.Deliciousness , consistency very nice staff!!!What else can you ask for???I come here everyday before work and for lunch hour. The sandwiches are delicious every time it's just to perfection!!! I've literally tried everything on menu so far.... my favorite is grilled cheese , Italian sub and pastrami ... I always get cold brew super yum!!!!The staff super friendly at all times... if I'm in a rush I try call in my order prior to getting there ....I try come on weekend with my mom she loves the bagel.Ordered delivery one Sunday morning while recovering from hanging out with my younger sisters. I'm here to tell y'all that the memes about recovery time when you get older are true! Anyway, the food from this place helped revive me. I ordered a baconeggandcheese (yes 1 word) on a croissant (I was feeling fancy), it was perfection. I also ordered a piece of marble pound cake that was so moist and delicious. Sorry, no pics, I was too hungry and hungover to do anything but eat and fall back asleep. I found a new spot to order from, everything looks good..Quickest delivery I've ever received. The pastrami, cheese, and egg on brioche bun was delicious. I would definitely recommend. It was the perfect way to start my day. The everything bagel with vegetable cream cheese was good as well. I liked the unique texture of the bagel."
"I am a regular Panera customer.  I have frequented this Panera regularly for many years and although there has been turnover over the years partially due to the Pandemic I have always found the employees very helpful and accommodating. Was sorry to see that Mery is no longer here but happy to see Devila  is still there. The two of them were always so welcoming greeting me by my first name. I frequent different Paneras but this location is my favorite..Ordered delivery thanks to the ""spend fifteen get ten dollar off"" promotion. Got a full grilled cheese and a tomato soup bowl. Can't say the grilled cheese lived up to its name because it was far from grilled. Barely cooked on the exterior and was still smushy like any ol' white bread. American cheese smacked between some white bread is not the worth 7-9ish bucks (but I guess that's Panera for you). The tomato soup is plenty and I plan on making my own grilled cheese and eating it together (I'm sure I can get a couple more sandwiches out of it). The service at the store is really great and that's about the only good part of the overall general experience..The pastries of Panera Bread are decent and we visit there every one to two weeks when we don't have any idea what to eat for breakfast. We have subscribed to their unlimited coffee plan for months and this was our first time seeing that all the coffee wasn't served in hot & fresh. Hence, we were disappointed with their service at this location. The indoor dining is currently available and their safety procedures for COVID-19 is pretty good. The staff checked temperature for every customer and kept social distance between tables..From 3/14/2018.Number of visits: More than three times.This location has been crowded most times I've been there. Even with plentiful seating, there doesn't seem to be enough. A socially anxious person like myself would see an empty seat as if it were a refuge. It's not their fault.However, what is their fault is the lack of commitment to cleanliness. Also, picking up an order can be a pain in the ass. You hear your order somewhere in the loudness, you go over to pick it up, and food that may or may not be yours just sits there for a moment as you wait for one employee to be available for just one second to confirm that this is indeed your order. A lack of communication is always an F in my book.The food has been mostly above average; the quality is there. The cheddar broccoli soup is to die for (4 / 5) and the sandwiches here and there have been delicious. However, my most recent order was a steak sandwich which was underwhelming. For a $10 sandwich, there wasn't enough steak, and the little steak that was in it was dripping a little too much blood.Still, not bad. Will I return? Occasionally, as usual..Because of the pandemic, this was the first time we visited Panera in a while. We were rather disappointed. We ordered 2 breakfast sandwiches, one with and one without cheese (my wife cannot eat dairy). For starters, we sat at the table for over 15 minutes until we got a buzz signal (and the restaurant was not busy at all). When I went to pick up the sandwiches, I saw that both had cheese. I tried to tell the kitchen staff that the order was wrong. They pointedly ignored me for 5 minutes (chatting with each other, relaxing, and not cooking anything, since there were no customers). Then one of them said rudely that she doesn't know what I'm talking about. I walked away and returned with my wife who explained dairy would make her sick. At that point one of the staff said they'd re-do her sandwich, accordimg to their order, which they did in about 5 minutes.I think paying $5 for a piece of bread with scambled eggs and really bad, rude service is not an experience I'll ever want to repeat.Even before pandemic we had multiple incidents with this particular Panera location - the food was clearly not fresh, smelled terrible, and had to be returned..I try to avoid going to panera bread, but i like the over price pastries, then i said let me order diner for my kids so i won't have to cook waited a very long time, i notice other people was checking their order and almost everyone has an issue so i decided to check my, low and behold off course my sandwich was missing, the girl had an attitude but i got , oh yes i got it see photos.After shopping for furniture for my new apartment I took my mom here to pickup dinner. She's never had Panera Bread so I wanted her first time to be memorable. We opted for our orders to be to-go. We were beyond exhausted and wanted to get home in a jiffy.We were greeted and treated so nicely by the young lady who worked the register. She took her time to explain the combos to my mom and what certain items contained. My mom ordered half steak & argula sandwich with a small lobster Mac & cheese. I ordered a full bacon turkey bravo sandwich.Once we got home we decided to dig in. My mom couldn't stop raving about her sandwich. She liked her Mac and cheese sans the lobster claw. It was extremely fishy and salty. We were both under the impression that the Mac and cheese would have  sliced up lobster pieces mixed in, however we were sadly mistaken. She also stated that the Mac and cheese was a little too cheesy for which says a lot because she loves cheese. My bacon turkey bravo sandwich was on the bland side. I couldn't enjoy it because it was dry and lacked condiments. I tried jazzing it up but I ended up tossing it..I just ordered from Panera Bread and I was eating my salad and found a bug, not just any bug, a live bug. It ran up from the salad. I am really grossed out right now. Disgusted. I am filing a report with the health department..The front girl who was working today was so rude, I simply asked if they had a certain soup, she rolls her eyes, with an attitude she gives me an answer. If you don't like your job, simply quit. Nobody told you to work. I didn't want to write a review but she keeps huffing and puffing and giving me nasty attitude. Idk who she think she is but she needs to get fired or get spoken too because she was giving everybody attitude. Idk what she has up her butt but she needs to quit it. Never coming back here again. SUPER RUDE. Don't waste ur time or money..I ordered Panera via uber eats and I received rotten Avocados on my sandwich had to throw this in the garbage. Panera is this the food quality and service you provide customers? On top of this they got my side order wrong."
"I went last Saturday as a party of four (with reservation).  The restaurant was packed.  I wish I caught the manager's name, but he was so professional with any delay in service.Fantastic food & venue.  We got various items including cocktails, raw bar items / appetizers, cooked appetizers, pasta, and fish entrees, and i would order all again..Skip this place... Half of the menu items were not available- no lobster roll, no lobster tempura roll, no miso salmon and so on. The sea urchin pasta was terrible and tasteless. It looked great too- such a disappointment. The ribeye was average at best, the mashed potatoes cold. The spicy tuna crispy rice was terrible compared to other places. They forgot to bring our filet and then it came out more than halfway into our meal. The only good dish was the mac and cheese. Try somewhere else.Delicious food overshadowed by head-scratching moments and lackluster pacing.When we first arrived, we were greeted by a host at the top of the steps (this is a partially sub-street establishment).  He checked our name, saw that we had a reservation and asked if we'd prefer indoor or outdoor.  After a quick convo, we opted for indoor and we were directed down the stairs to the inside check-in/host station.  This hostess could not have been more condescending.  She informed us that our reservation (for 4) was outdoors and that there were several large parties booked and we could not have an indoor table.  There were abundant open booths which would not have accommodated larger parties.  An apology and a redirect would have been fine.  The attitude was not appreciated.  What also was not appreciated was the fact that we were given the option in general.  There's no communication between the two host stands as far as reservations or availability?  It started things off on the wrong foot.  Let's move past this...BTW, the indoor atmosphere is top notch!We were escorted to an outdoor table.  Two of us arrived first, waiting for the other two.  We were questioned by no less than five separated individuals as to our party size.  Three of which attempted to clear away the other 2 settings.  That grew frustrating quickly...Our server was excellent.  Attentive, friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and was able to address ingredients/allergy concerns.  He was on point.For our appetizers, we went with tuna tacos and a few sushi rolls.Our tacos arrived quite quickly.  Nice crisp shell, delicious sushi grade tuna.  Delicious.Our sushi took forever.  Our server apologized and said that the sushi chefs were pretty backed up.  No big deal, as we were in no particular hurry.  He even apologized by adding a complementary spicy tuna over crispy sushi rice.The rolls were fresh and creative.  The fish was fresh and delicious.  No complaints on the food, as it was all quite tasty.However, the aforementioned backup led to our entrees arriving while we were still in the middle of our apps.  This led to a busser literally hovering over me while I was trying to eat.  Despite clearly not being finished, he took my plate out from under me whilst I was chewing.  There was still plenty of sushi left on the table.  It was unacceptable.My entrée was quite tasty.  Miso glazed salmon cooked to order.  Fresh and flavorful.  I simply didn't appreciate it being stuffed in front of me while I still had a mouthful of app.  I respect that the sushi bar was backed up, but the kitchen needs to do a better job of accounting for that via communication.They offered a complementary dessert.  A warm chocolate chip cookie/soufflé, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Tasty, but a touch salty.  One of our party ordered a cup of coffee to pair with it.  Unfortunately, the coffee arrived about ten minutes after we'd finished the dessert.Overall, the food was quite good, though overpriced for what it was.  I felt bad for our server, as he seemed to have his act together, but his efforts were undone by poor communication and poor pacing from the kitchen..Food was superb. We came in for a quick bite to eat before catching a show and we were so pleasantly surprised. RECOMMEND: We didn't get a picture of our squid ink pasta- in truth because we were so excited to eat it. OYSTERS were fresh and oh so tasty. The crispy rice was presented in a different and delicious way. Maybe: The sea bass was very rich but delicious all the same. I'm not sure I'd choose this again, but I am not unhappy. It was tasty but maybe too much for me.  Highly recommend for drinks as well. There is a tiny bar in the back. Ambiance is cool and electric. It's a very loud and busy restaurant.  MINUS A STAR... please change the playlist once in a while. The same song played FOUR times while we were there. I used to love ""can I kick it"" but now I realized they should just kick this playlist to the curb.Came here during Restaurant Week for dinner ($59) with a party of 4. Upon arriving, we were asked for proof of ID and vaccination. We were promptly seated afterwards at one of the U shaped booths.Our server (Jesus if I remembered correctly) warmly greeted us and was super patient with us throughout the entire experience. Gave us recommendations when asked. Super professional and friendly.For drinks, we ordered La Duse ($20) (Rittenhouse Straight Rye, Lucano Amaro, Orange Bitters) and Lychee Martini ($18) (Dorothy Parker Gin, Lychee, Cucumber, Lemon). Both are pretty solid cocktails depending on what you fancy.For appetizers, we had the following:Roasted Butternut Squash Soup - Could have been a better experience if it wasn't cold. Felt like this soup had been sitting out for a while.Kenai Roll - Essentially a spicy salmon roll with fancy garnishing. Tastes as great as it looks.Tuna Tartare - My favorite, of all the choice, even though I didn't get this. Wished I did instead of the soup. The various flavors is something to die for.For entrees, we had the following:Nori Crusted Tuna - The entree I picked and it tastes amazing. Presentation is nice and all for the gram, but it's all about the taste. Had to cut the tuna into smaller pieces so I could savor every bite for a bit longer.Lobster Ravioli - You get five pieces, but unfortunately this does not look filling compared to the rest of the entrees.Miso Glazed Salmon - Well I have never heard someone ask how they like their fish cooked: rare, medium, well done, and everything in between. Medium was the recommendation and the two that ordered salmon were happy with what they got. For dessert there was only two choices. Depending on what kind of tastes and flavor you like, the choices were pretty simple to make.Key Lime Pie - If you love key lime like I do, this is the way to go. Citrusy-bitter taste with a nice balance of sweetness to it.Molten Chocolate Cake - You're a chocolate fan this is a no brainer. It's not too sweet and it's paired with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.Overall it was a very pleasant experience. Our server is what made it exceptional. Food were presented very nicely and super pretty to look at while also tasting great. Whether they were worth ordering is another story as some were filling and others weren't. We did all leave not hungry, but not bloated. Restaurant week is the way to go if you're looking to not break the bank, but still enjoy what Lure Fishbar has to offer..I've been excited about Lure Fishbar for a while, unfortunately our experience didn't live up to the hype. I was so intrigued by their restaurant week menu which is why I came here in the first place. When we showed up to be seated, the staff let us know that their gas wasn't working and as a result they were no longer doing restaurant week items. They also mentioned they would have a shorter menu that night. I completely understand that these things can go wrong but the waitstaff seemed annoyed that we were there to dine there rather than showing any sign of an apology. Regardless we tried their shortened menu which was decent.They were able to make my cocktail without added sugar which I appreciated as it was still a delicious cocktail. As for the food, the tuna tacos were good but I didn't feel like it was incredible - could have had some more flavor. The sushi rolls were actually not good at all, they were very poorly constructed and overpriced. The uni pasta dish we got was delicious and was definitely the highlight of the night..We visited Lure Fish Bar for restaurant week, and this place was beautiful. Vibes were really immaculate, a bit loud towards dinner service (which is normal), but it definitely passed the vibes check. The menu is very extensive, with raw seafood, to sushi, to a little Italian, and typical seafood. We went for the restaurant week menu. Food: 1. Oysters: We got a variety of oysters, and they were all fresh and really good! I could have gone for more! 2. For Appetizers off the Restaurant Week menu, I got the Kenai Roll, which is Spicy Salmon, Cucumber, Scallion, Crispy Shallots. The sushi was really fresh and honestly, this was really filling itself, which is impressive for a restaurant week menu item. The fish had a really clean taste, not fishy at all. Rice was nicely seasoned. 3. For the Entree off the Restaurant Week menu, I got the Nori Crusted Tuna, which was paired with garlic fried rice, chinese broccoli, with citrus emulsion. The tuna had a nice crunchy exterior to it, but I would have preferred the fish to be a little bit more rare, as it was a little dry. The rice was really light and filling. Overall, the dish was not bad, and I appreciated the amount of food it came with. 4. I added the lure sushi combo to the meal, which was really filling and I am glad I added it. More fish! More sushi! We ended the night with dessert. I got the molten lava cake and my friend ordered the key lime pie. The molten lava cake was really gooey, and the salted caramel cream was DELICIOUS. I could drink that. Overall, good price for the meal. We ordered supplements, items off the regular menu, and drinks, so the bill came up to be a little higher. However, for the restaurant menu, the price was well worth it! Would def. come again for some drinks and would order more items off the regular item (raw bar)..Absolutely delicious. The ambience is great and we had a reservation for outdoors but it was freezing out so they were able to accommodate us indoors. The oysters, tuna tartar tacos, and crispy rice ponzu are all great appetizers. The salmon and branzino entrees were good choices too. I personally enjoyed the appetizers more than the entrees but everything was great nonetheless..This place was beautiful. Vibes were truly immaculate. They took the nautical theme to another level by making it feel like you're actually sitting in a boat. The music is also greattttWe started with oysters which were all very fresh and delicious. We tried each type and there were 3 East Coast types and 2 West Coast types. The crispy rice with spicy tuna was delicious (definitely better than Nobu). The shrimp tempura roll was also very good, albeit small. The branzino was delicious with very crispy skin and the spinach and mashed potatoes it came with were great as well. Overall, very good but a little pricey for the portion sizes..Came here on a Sunday evening around 7pm and was fortunate enough to get a table for 3. Very nice look and vine to the restaurant. Service was top notch and the menu has plenty of choices. The food was very good and tasty and came out in a reasonable time, both appetizers and main courses. Really enjoyed my dinner here and I definitely see myself coming back again. Prices are maybe a bit steep for some but I have no complaints at all because I felt it was well worth it with all I received."
"We stumbled upon this place due to the proximity of our hotel. What a great find!  The staff were very friendly, the service was good and fast and the Chelsea Burger with hand-cut fries was delicious!  It was a Saturday night, a full house, but still able to get a good table. We would definitely come back!.This is my second or third time coming here for Trivia. On my last visit, it was a bust because nobody showed up! They gave us a free drink of our choice for our troubles, which was a nice gesture. On this past visit, it was vastly different, as the entire bar was packed with people. I waited in the front for the hostess to greet me, but she didn't. So I kinda just walked up to her, which I was surprised I had to do. In the midst of this occurring-- one of the staffers comes up to me and asked me if I was the delivery dude-- I'm like WTH? Nonetheless, we were taken to our seats, the server was decent. I had the Penne Alla Vodka, which was relatively bland and some French Fries, which had way too much salt. I had the warm spiked cider, which was very good. I'd probably only return here for trivia, not for the food..We stopped in for a bite before heading to a comedy show. Both inside and out were pretty busy but the outside patio has purple flowers strung up and plenty of seating for groups of 4-5. They were full outside when we came in so we went inside where you have to show your vaccination card to be seated. It was crowded and pretty loud but they have 2 person booths in the back which creates an intimate setting. We ordered food from the bar and got the chicken tacos and pasta with shrimp. They advertised an all day (Wednesday) taco special but when we asked it was not available.The food came in about 10 minutes and the tacos were delicious. They fill them with refried black beans and the flavors were great! The pasta with shrimp was just as delicious. The shrimp were large and not overcooked. Parmesan shavings on top added the right amount of cheese while the sauce was bursting with flavor. We ate our meal within 15 minutes it was that good. Definitely recommend this spot but it gets 4 stars for not having additional information on the taco Wednesday special (i.e. does it end at a certain time)..Great service and great play list . Totally awesome environment  and good drinks . :).Disappointed in this place despite how close this place is to me. I got the margarita flatbread to-go and finally got it after 25 minutes of waiting! The flatbread itself was super tiny and soggy and ~20 dollars. If you are looking for food I would suggest you go to one of the other many options on the block!.Quick bite before heading to museum.. You have to shoe proof of vaccination to dine in. Atmosphere: cute outdoor setup. Service: good. Only issue was we didn't actually see our bill it was on the servers handheld device. Food: ok. Burger, fries, mozzarella sticks and a caesar salad..Came here for casual drinks, they have a nice heated outdoor patio area. Overhead heating.They have a menu of warm drinks called winter warmers. I got the spiked hot chocolate which was pretty tasty.We also ordered some guacamole and chips to go along the drinks (the new rule for Covid is that you have to order food alongside drinks).Good spot to get some social activity in an outdoor social distanced manner..Indoor seating has returned to NYC. Now we are just waiting for the customer service to catch up. Slowly but surely it's happening..First time coming here, and I really enjoyed myself. The place is covered with TV's, perfect sports bar for games, and the happy hour menu is really good. The bar is really long, and the place is very roomy where one half is a general standing area for informal chit chat and dancing, and the other side has nice seating by the windows. We didn't each much, but the poutine was really good considering it's hard (for me) to find good poutine. I hope to have a bigger appetite next time I go.  Perfect for an impromptu meet up with friends after work, or (in my case) a date with a nice gal. I would definitely go back! Highly recommend..Great fun bar with good food and drinks. Perfect spot to hang with friends or watch a sports game."
"Rating: 5.0/5.018 Bakery Inc. is a classic Chinese bakery. The buns are tasty, and the fillings are generous. I should know as I have eaten the breads here for at least fourteen days since the New Year.Here are some items I have eaten recently:- Ham and Egg Bun- Pork Floss Bun- Raisin Custard Bun- Hot Dog Bun- Coconut Pineapple Bun- Roast Pork Bun- Custard Pineapple Bun- Red Bean Pineapple BunApologies for the pictures of squashed-looking bread; I had to fit them in a suitcase. That said, I assure you they were picture-perfect at time of purchase..Bakery hasn't slowed down during Covid. In-dining is back again. The roasted pork buns which I complained about in my previous review are also back to normal with plenty of filling. There was a time when they were skimpy with the meat. Glad it's back to normal again..This bakery is also known as OK Bakery. I have been coming here for a long time now. As you can see by my past review, I really loved the place. Somethings have recently changed during my last visit. My usual roast pork bun which was savory and filled with roast pork was under filled. Filling was only one bit. My order of sticky rice which have been a large portion in the past is only half of the size. Order of Sui Mai was also smaller in size. Also the chicken feet was bland and lack of color. If they don't change back, I will not be coming there again..Best local Chinese bakery in Bensonhurst Brooklyn for a valued breakfast. Besides serving the usual dim sum items, I have found that their morning specials of lo mein, sauté sticky rice, and rice noodles to be the most flavorful of all the bakeries I've tried. Dishes are lacking in the meat department but it's the same for all the bakeries around the area. $4+ for a large order to go is best bang for the buck! The bakery items are also good but it's the noodles that I make the special trip there..i order a sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf. warning there was ant on my food!!!!! i dont know how this place got a a!!! food is extremely dirty!!! do not come here!!!.Sad curry beef pie because there's no curry and little to no beef, so it's not even the same item for the price. The drinks are alright though.I take that back. The milk tea was bad..Very friendly staff, clean interior. The white steam bun (mantou) is soft/fluffy/milky --there are other flavors too, it's not like other bakeries--. The lemon pasty (it's rectangular in shape) & red bean wife's biscuits (Loh Por Paeng) is bomb (but sadly they don't make it all the time or just sold out). They also have some small dim sum dishes. Overall the price is great compared to chinese bakeries in Manhattan..I love going to this bakery for the black bean bread. It's so good and it's only $3.00 a loaf. I can't wait to try other baked goods..This bakery makes few dim sum dishes. I'm giving a four star only for their sticky rice. Their sticky rice is a MUST try. Unlike most sticky rice at dim sum places, It's not dry and sticky. It's moist and soft. It has an unique taste. This place also sells siew Mai and other small dishes as well. The bakery itself is just like other usual Chinese bakery. Not all fancy , not all that. But their sticky rice is worth the try..Do not go here. Everything is expired. I ordered a Horlick drink and the drink was extremely stale. I asked the worker and She said it regularly taste like that. I asked her to look at the jug of powder and it had a really bad odor- smelled like cat shit. they place it out in the open with no lid. She did not give us a refund and stated that it regularly smells like that and I know for a fact it does not. Worker has no idea what the fuck she was doing..The bread is fresh and the food is good. I will definitely go back!! The staff is friendly and the place is clean..I came back 3 mornings in a row. It opens very early in the morning. Great business attitude. They try to do Cantonese and Western style breakfast at one place, which makes life a lot easier for many Chinese residents living in Bensonhurst. 粥還不錯吃。腸粉則有待改進。各式西點麵包花樣蠻多的但不是很精緻。價格公道。環境可能不是年輕人的首選。看透世間繁華的我倒是覺得有趣可愛親民。"
"Got some of their bakery goods free from a relative, who was visiting me. So, I don't know what the cost are.I tried:Egg Tart :- Nicely done. The crust had multiple flaky layers. Many places  have stopped doing this because of the work involved and started doing the more cookie like crust. But I love the classic flaky version and the custard was done just right.""Wifey"" cake (lor por bang) :- Again, a classic done right. The effort shows in their in the final product. The filling was just right and the crust is nice and flaky and melts in your mouth.Sponge Cake in Paper:- Even , spongy, just the right amount of sweetness, baked just right. Sometimes, at other bakeries, I've had this undercooked and wet or too sweet. This was baked just right and had the correct texture and sweetness.I've eaten a lot of these Chinese Bakery Goods at other bakeries and I appreciate a well done solid Chinese pastry. Lots of places just push out ""half baked"" goods and don't really try.OK Bakery is better than OK to me. :)(Dudes, Change the Name to ""Totally Awesome Bakery"" or ""Better than that Other Bakery""   LOL)I'll definitely visit their store the next time I'm Back in Brooklyn..OK bakery is really just mediocre ... this place is located less than 1 block from me so I come here quite often for that reason . I used to come here everyday before work but not anymore .. their price is very messed up . The price board says one thing , when I pay is a different thing . The price is always more than what is posted . The sponge cake here lacks fluffiness and undesirable. Gross. The lo mein that I get used to be 1.75 and now is 1.95  .. and after they raised their price they don't give you as much as they used to !!!! Oh here's an other thing .. their breads and cakes are like 80 cents to a dollar or so , one day I had some extra change (like 3 quarters , 1 dime and 5 pennies) and the  lady tells me ""We don't take pennies"" WTF ,YOU CHARGE 90 cents for an item AND YOU DONT TAKE 5 PENNIES  !? Every time I come here I get more and frustrated and frustrated ... I know these are small issues but enough to make me stop coming here .Now when I go to work I drive to other bakeries even though this place is 1 block away .I would avoid this place unless I really need something really quick ..Our family loves to get sponge cake topped off with fresh fruits and cream from here for any occasions. My son loves the honeydew and apricot fruits and i like the strawberries. The sponge cake is always moist and cream isnt too heavy. I also saw some nicely baked buns and egg tarts from here and seems pretty busy especially after work hours. The staff is also nice and friendly. Definitely one of my go to bakeries..Back then I always came here to buy some breads and drinks on the go. Then I stopped, which I forgot why any way. Today I went back and bought some things to go and I remember why I stopped coming here. It was much better back then and now it's just like their name says it all ""OK""They used to have so many selections for breads and cakes, but now it's very basic bread that you would find at any Chinese bakery. Today I wanted a red bean ice, but they told me all the red beans were sold out and opted with red bean powder. They told me it's basically the same, but the powder tastes better. So I went with it and was I wrong. It is not the same and it doesn't taste better...it's very powdery and doesn't taste anything like red bean. I also bought two egg tarts, which were ok.I know if I really want a red bean ice, I wouldn't come here to get one..Am not sure why any establishment would willingly brand itself as mediocre, but I will write this off as being lost-in-translation.  Then again, this is your standard Chinese Bakery quality: no more, no less.  Sponge cakes are consistently spongey, and the white-sugar rice-flour isoceles triangles (tastes a lot better than this clinical description) were pretty delicious.Don't go for the pre-cooked noodle options in the back: they are comparatively expensive, and usually look a little sad.  Bakeries do baked goods well, but don't trust their other adventures in cooking.Bonus: They have a bathroom, but will charge you 50 cents per use..The only bun I like from this bakery is the red bean bun, which I highly recommend. All the other buns aren't good. The customer service isn't good either..bakery used to have good cakes. recently bought one and it was bland. it didnt live up to the cakes name. gross. breads are decent. bleh."
"Best Squid Pad Thai I've ever had in my life.'nuff said..Great place for a thai meal! Highly recommend the veg duck dishes..This place was the sister restaurant to planet Thailand the best Thai food back in the 80s and 90s but is closed. It's a shame that the Thai restaurants left on the upper east side of Manhattan cannot compete, this is miles better.Sister restaurant to the original Planet Thailand in Williamsburg that was greatest restaurant experience for many many years. The food here is ok and about equal to most Thai places I've been in NY. More importantly it desperately needs way more improvement in operating procedures especially for table service (it appears take-out is there primary customer base). If you're expecting a reincarnation of PT, you'll be very disappointed.I absolutely love Thai food and hadn't tried this spot yet. I ordered both pad Thai and spring rolls and they both lacked flavor I was pretty disappointed :/.Great place for takeout. Very nice staff and great food. Especially recommend their fried dumplings..Food is a bit bland. I got the pad Thai, their drunken noodles equivalent, and ground basil chicken. The pad Thai with the pickled onions was a nice touch though.My partner and I picked up a to-go order from Thai Cafe after finishing a rather long photo shoot up the street. The server was so helpful, understanding, and accommodating. Additionally, the food was fantastic and they even threw in a free Thai iced tea! It was exactly what we needed following the afternoon we'd had. If I find myself in the neighborhood again, I'm definitely ordering from there!.Really bland & boring. We ordered take out, it came quickly & was not terribly expensive, but not good. I got the pad kee mao, which is suppose to be spicy and full of flavor. It tastes like slightly spicy cardboard. I also got the veggie version, it had one big piece of tofu & a weird array of veggies that you don't usually find in the dish. Seems like they just threw all the scrap veggies into a dish. I don't live in GP but I know there's better places than this..I love Thai cafe! Their curries got me through COVID while I was sick and couldn't leave the house. Always delicious and their staff is very sweet and friendly..Great deal for lunch special includes a salad, appetizer and an entree. Entree portion is pretty generous for lunch special. Waitress was very friendly but not too much."
"I was almost put off going by the negative reviews, but I decided to give it a go. I was pleasantly surprised by friendly, helpful staff and a great value tasty meal. It was great that there was more than one veggie option, as NYC doesn't seem to cater very well to vegetarians/vegans. I didn't use the toilet, but the restaurant was clean, as was my table..This location is a hot mess! To start, they still don't offer the cauliflower rice base (I feel like that was added to the Chipotle menu months ago).In addition, today they were out of chicken. They kept telling everyone in line that asked for it that it would be ready in 5-6 minutes when in reality they were out of it for nearly 20 minutes. They were also out of steak for part of that time. This was during lunch time on a weekday, which I assume is their busiest time. Seems kind of crazy to be out of two of your main proteins! It's also not a particularly large location so everyone waiting for chicken was in close proximity to each other. There's two other locations nearby so I'll try one of them the next time I need my Chipotle fix!.Poor customer service. Avoid this place if possible. Came here on May 22 at 830pm and doors were lock. They have a rent a cop who is completely useless. Kept pointing a sign that says we going digital. Apparently they only do online pick up, but be warn it took exactly 50 mins to get my food. Upon waiting every employee and the rent a cop were just standing on their phones. Also the rent a cop is their food runner, after waiting 30 mins I ask politely if they received my order, and got the response it's not ready. Okay I understand if you were to ask the crew if they received my order and they said that, that's cool but he didn't even bother asking and just went back on his phone.Didn't even receive what I order..I normally never leave reviews but not order delivery from here, I ordered at 7:30pm through the Chipotle app and didn't receive my order, my delivery driver then called me to say the store was closed, yet the hours show they are open till 10pm, this was a horrible experience for me..Worst chipotle place I've been to. Mobile ordered 10 mins ago and they even didn't put what I want. Besides, compared to other store I went to everything is little here. Little sauce little rice little meat. Paid $12 but feels like only got $6. Wouldn't come back.This is my local chipotle and the food is fine but the staff can be rude and there are often people in the restaurant asking for money or for food..Pretty standard Chipotle next to Port Authority on 8th Ave with limited seating.  Some of the staff are great - very friendly and efficient and others not so much - it evens out, I suppose.  The food is your typical Chipotle fare although portions can run light compared to other locations.  It's an option if you are in the area and need something quick as they have mobile ordering here..I walk from to this place FOR MY LUNCH BREAK saids is open at 1045 am but it's 1230PM  and it's close DISAPOINTED LOST MY TIME.Chipotles in NYC are my go to healthy fast food choice! It's never easy finding good healthy places for lunch everyday. So chipotle is always there for ya.I am such a HUGE fan of Chipotle and I tend to frequent this Chipotle quite often.  The employees there are possibly the nicest I've ever met.  Hell, I even told my family that the employees are awesome.  I go weekly, usually on Mondays and one of the staff members asked me ""What's your name, sir? You come here quite often!""  I appreciated it because she's right, I do! I doubt she'll remember my name but the fact that she even cared to ask was very sweet of her.The food is, the best in the area, in comparison to the other Chipotle's.  I have been to two others and, for some reason or another, it never quite tastes the same as here.  I'll continue to go to this Chiptole because it's just so delicious."
"I've been ordering lunch here for about 2 months or so now since I discovered this place. Delivery guy is always nice and gets to me around noon without any major delays. I love the fact they have different set bento lunches every day and the portions are just enough without overfilling you. the meat dishes are usually the same with slight differences each day. Its the fish dishes that usually offers more variety and taste. There are times I wish the fish is less salty but overall I've not had a bad bento from this place. If there's one thing you got to try its the burdock salad!Order early and ahead of time if you can cause their bentos sells out fast online. Which is probably the only complaint I have of this place. A lot of their dosai items like salads and other side orders goes quick!.Nestled in the shadows next to Grand Central is BentOn Cafe.  They specialize in creating Bento Box lunches packaged in actual boxes .... the same type of boxes used for chocolate!  Walling in, you immediately see that this is strictly a takeout operation with only a few bar stools on the side walls.  Food is pre-cooked and plated as you order (think Panda Express, except higher quality quality).  I order the Japanese Fried Chicken on a bed of Kale salad and white  rice.  The chicken is crunchy and drizzled with some sweet sauce for a perfect balance of sweet and savory.  There is a little vinaigrette on the kale that brings a refreshing contrast to the fried chicken.   This is definitely a winner. Ambience/Decor:  Tasteful Japanese themed takeout.  Very limited seating.Food:  Best asian fried chicken kale salad.  If only all  salads tasted this good.TLDR:  Run, don't walk to get thee best Japanese Fried Chicken Kale Salad in town..Small little restaurant right near my office. Can't believe it took me over two years to try it! I had the basic ramen for my lunch. And wow I was so pleasantly surprised it was delicious. BentOn is a small, mostly takeout restaurant with lots of options on the menu. Since I only tried one dish, I will have to start adding to my review. The ramen costed about $13 and was very good. Nice to have a new go-to restaurant for a quick take out lunch!  Plenty of other sandwich and bento box specials available. It seemed like they kept putting new things out. Gotta go and and see what else there is to offer. Enjoy!.Been staying at The Maxwell near Lexington and 50th weekly for a month now.  NY restaurants super expensive, so for my day to day quick meals, been surviving on slices, bagels and Halal carts.  Was nice to find this quick, Japanese alternative and have some rice  for a change!Just down the street a few blocks, off 45th, found this little To Go window serving bento boxes.  Had to go with the crispy pork cutlet with Curry.  It appeared this To Go window was attached to an actual restaurant inside, similar concept to what you are often in Seattle.  Paid for my lunch and headed back to my hotel.When I opened my bag, I was impressed to see the packaging.  It was a 2-tiered trey, with rice on the bottom, and the sliced cutlet was separate in its own trey on top to keep its crispy outer layer.  Meanwhile the rice was still warm below.  Smart!The Curry came in a separate container.  I like this so that I could control how much I added.  I tend to not like my rice drowning in sauce, so this was perfect for me.  They also gave a bowl of miso soup, another welcome surprise to settle the stomach of this busy traveler.All in all I really liked their concept.  Portion was a little small for me, but the miso soup helped fill me up.  Cool little spot for people on the go, craving, not too expensive Japanese food..Benton Cafe is still serving up healthy, tasty, AFFORDABLE Japanese food, but with a different store layout and vibe. I got really nervous (why does it look so hipster vs homey now??) but I can attest that the service, value, and food are great, and the store layout issues are solved. There is still NO SEATING but I will say they do take credit cards, so the other reviewer who noted cash only should go and try again. The store now has three kinds of options:Custom donburi/bento boxes (or rice bowls with stuff vs little boxes of stuff)Pre-made grab and go bento boxesBaked goods (much smaller selection than previous)The custom line allows you to pick two warm ""mains"" like fried chicken, braised beef, tofu, or hearty veggies. Then you get four cool sides, like white/brown rice, kale/quinoa salad, potato salad, burdock, hijiki seaweed, kabocha pumpkin, and coleslaw. I liked what I picked today (karaage, tofu, pumpkin, burdock, hijiki, and kale) and the flavors are fresh and clean, customary to their homemade Japanese style. You can add a bunch of sauces to the proteins if you want a heavier teriyaki like thing, but that's not why I come here. My bento was $10.50 ish as of April 2018. Oh, and it came with a small miso soup, as usual.If you liked Benton's previous grab and go bentos, they're largely the same sides, but the mains may be different fromt he custom line. Today's pre-mades were white meat chicken katsu and a broiled mackerel. Only two choices versus back in the day where there would be six different bentos. I think you can still check the menu online.Baked goods are by Parisienne/Zaiya. While the selection is much smaller, the chocolate covered mochi doughnut is still around, as well as the little pancakes. I'm a little saddened by this. I would like a cookie sometimes!The chirashi bowls were not there (today is Tuesday) but I'm secretly hoping maybe its just my timing and maybe its still on the menu? The chirashi bowls were seriously the best, great value, fresh fish. I also loved their bimbimbap noodles that they offer in the summer, so we will see if those come back. (PLEASE!) I also did not see udons, soups, or teas. My coworker says Benton is usually on MealPal these days but they only really offer the karaage chicken. I think the other options are pretty good, so I recommend a visit if this is your jam!.BentOn Cafe serves grab and go Japanese pastries, sandwiches, bentos, and bowls. There are no tables. There are no places to put anything down. There isn't even enough space inside to fit a stroller. But their Thursday and Friday chirashi bowls for $9 and freshly made onigiri make me a believer.You must be here before 12:15 pm to have a chance at getting the chirashi! This summer they also have offered a cold noodle bim bim bap that is EXCELLENT. I also love their swiss roll cakes, the almond cookies, the onigiri... Of the things I've tried, I'll say the only thing that is average is the coffee.Portions are just right for me, but may be small if you are a big eater. Prices are affordable for a Midtown Lunch. Do NOT bring an entourage as there is no space. The line often goes outside the store. Menu is posted online and is usually changes every week ( benton.nyc/bentoncafe-me… ). The ladies behind the counter are lovely people. There have been several times that I've showed up at noon and their delivery of sushi hasn't come in yet, so do expect that there may be hiccups sometimes..BentOn Cafe serves grab and go Japanese pastries, bentos, and bowls. There are no tables. There are no places to put anything down. There isn't even enough space inside to fit a stroller. But their Friday chirashi bowls for $9 and freshly made onigiri make me a believer. I haven't even ordered anything else here yet - the chirashi is that tasty that I'm loathe to try anything else. And yes, you must be here before noon to have a chance at getting the chirashi!Portions are just right for me, but may be small if you are a big eater. Do NOT bring an entourage. Menu is posted online and is usually changes every week..My favorite go to place for a quick and delicious lunch.   Real comfort food.  On a regular basis I usually have a few of the Onigiri, but today per the recommendation of the owner, I had the bento box.  It was awesome!!!  Really enjoyed my lunch.  Teriyaki salmon, fried chicken, pumpkin purée, root veggie medley, tomato and kale salad, with brown rice.  Healthy, and just enough..I stopped by around 12:30pm for weekday lunch and there was no line. I decided to create my own bento box which includes 2 protein and 4 sides. I picked mackerel, hamburger, curry tofu broccoli, pumpkin salad, potato salad and chicken cabbage salad. The protein sides were good but ridiculously small. It was also luke warm. The rest of the sides were refrigerated cold and not so good. The pumpkin salad was so disappointing. It tasted bland with a playdough like texture. I think they put some sort of filler in it (like flour?) I couldn't eat the chicken cabbage either. I only liked the potato salad but that's hard to go wrong. Everything cost $11.50 and I was barely satisfied. In fact my stomach felt weird. The packaging was adorable. The meal came with a tiny basic soup.. served cold. Tossed it. I think the better option is to go with their prepackaged bentos. I probaby won't come back..Nice little spot for lunch for not much $$, the big bento you chose 2 mains and 4 sides. I do wish they had ingredients listed on the salad cards - all the salads tasted good but I wish I knew what I was ordering. I asked an employee what was in the hiraki (sp?) salad and they said 'I don't know' and left it at that. The crispy chicken was good, teriyaki chicken was rubbery, perhaps from keeping it warmed for so long. I'll be back soon, don't let the little cubes fool you, it is a lot of food!.After almost five years of eating here, they have morphed into a combo of a lunch buffet with ""on-demand"" bentos where you get to pick the side dishes and a dinner ramen spot which starts serving ramen after 5 PM. Yes, the prepackaged bento boxes are still available, but they are generally not as good as they were when they first opened. The chirashi special that I raved about in 2014 which used to only be available on certain days of the week are generally available all the time now, but the rice to fish ratio leaves a lot to be desired (extreme amount of rice with very little fish). I am still quite partial to their sauce katsu don (fried chicken cutlet with sauce on rice) which is super yummy, and most of their grilled fish bentos are still not bad (although they sell out quickly). It's really now down to a 3.5 star, but the availability of a quick grab-and-go Japanese option in Grand Central makes it still worthwhile. I come and pick up onigiris a lot now here :) (two for $4.03 post tax!).tl;drThis place tops everything I have reviewed. 5.5 stars.tl;dr 2If you don't read anything in my review, go to Benton on a Friday (EARLY! like before 12:30 PM) and get their Friday special chirashi. Then come back and read this review. You will know why I freaking rave about this place.----If I could give 5.5 stars, Benton gets it. No, Chez Panisse and Ippudo are nowhere close to getting 5.5 stars.What makes Benton so magical is that they make the most incredible benton boxes that I have ever tasted -- no, EXPERIENCED -- in the United States. I spent some time studying abroad in Tokyo when I was in college, and I used to drop by this bento shop after my language school classes were over at around 4:30 PM. They were still selling the leftover bento boxes from lunch at a discount, and if I'm lucky I could score a bento for just 750 yen or so and have it as a yummy dinner. Benton is the reincarnation of that neighborhood bento shop in New York City.Benton's bento boxes are REALLY TASTY. I repeat, REALLY TASTY. You are probably used to shelling out $15 for the Soba Totto or the Sakagura lunch specials. To be honest, I stopped going to Soba Totto or Sakagura for lunch altogether after I discovered Benton. Their lunch specials are just as good, for HALF THE PRICE. It's so amazing, I have no idea how they do it.Every single one of Benton's bento boxes is a carefully curated symphony of flavors - it's crazy how many contrasting tastes they can pack into one bento box - we're talking a main course, rice, plus 3-4 side dishes! The side dishes are truly the stars of the bento - for example, you might see a clump of spinach next to your katsu for lunch, but rest assured, that spinach will certainly not be the plain boiled spinach you eat at home. One day it will be lightly tossed with vinegar, the next you might find a small dallop of sesame dressing at the bottom. Some of the small dishes are simply delightful - they often make these cute little vegetable skewers (we're talking 3 inches long) and then they deep fry the whole thing and pack it into a bento for your dining pleasure. Who does that??? What do YOU eat for lunch? A box of randomly chopped vegetables that cost you $10 at Chopt? A greasy hamburger smashed together over a smoky grill with onions and tomatoes carelessly thrown on top??I really admire the dedication and the time that is simply so evident in Benton's bento boxes. Yes, they may make food ""to go,"" but I would honestly pay double the price for sit down portions of their bentos in a restaurant. Woorijip in Ktown used to a go-to place for packed boxed meals, but I was just at Woorijip last night and it almost makes me angry that Woorijip is such a large establishment and open at all hours, while Benton is a small corner storefront in midtown that's functionally only open for lunch. I'm angry that Woorijip's food is so inferior compared to Benton, and I'm angry that Benton does not get more recognition.Anyways, just go and prepare for your mind to be blown. And it will be, if you know what good Japanese food taste like ;)IF YOU GO:-Benton has amazing (usually some form of sushi donburi) lunch specials on the weekdays. If you want to partake, please go EARLY. They are usually almost out by 1 PM and certainly out any time after that. The bento boxes luckily are not part of the special but they usually run out by 2 PM too.-Not only does Benton have amazing sushi/bentos, their cold noodle/rice bowls offerings are great too! I had the opportunity to try their bibim-noodle (like a bibimbap but with noodles, get it? :P) and their hiyashi chuka (cold noodles with sesame sauce) and both are fantastic! I also like their sauce katsu rice bowl.-They also make hot food (soba, udon, and ramen). I've actually never seen anybody order it because it probably takes some time, but you could try it if you want.-Free miso soup with purchase of bento. Make sure you ask for it! Sometimes the cashier doesn't give it to you unless you ask for it.-They have a rewards program, but it's unfortunately one of the most low-yield reward programs, to the order of something like buy 25 bentos, get 1 free. But still, better than nothing!-They're open on Saturday, but the selection is very small and looks almost like recycled Friday food (even though I'm sure it isn't). I would recommend to pass on Saturday.-They also have bread and onigiri if you don't want a bowl or a boxed lunch :)-Every meal is around $8. Seriously.This is so much text. I can't handle it. Just go. Sparknotes now:- Go on Thurs/Fri lunch and get their chirashis (Friday is better)- Try ANY of their bento boxes- Repeat. Rinse. Fall in love. TRY ALL OF THEM.I had two weeks when I was just studying for my board exams - I had Benton every single day for lunch. I was so happy. I was in love :).I love bento, especially if it is authentic Japanese bento. This spot call their offering ""Japanese Healthy Fast Food"" and offer bento box, sushi, donburi, and some pastries and other little snacks.I finally got to visit the store in Midtown on one weekend for lunch. The staff (lovely Japanese female) told me that shortly before we arrived, a large group of people came and bought out most of their bento boxes!!! So, there was not much selections left... And, it seems like their donburi items are offered during weekdays, not on weekends. Double punch there...We looked through their limited options, and picked up a few things that still looked really great. Since there is no seating in this location, we decided to take them home. The first item was their Pork Cutlet Curry, which comes with a small drink of your choice. We also bought a couple of rice balls and a Chocolate Mochi Doughnut. They were all rather simple yet comforting and pretty good flavor. I was super happy I finally got to visit BentOn. I would definitely go back again when I want something quick, comforting, tasty, and Japanese. They are super affordable, and if you get there before they ran out of their offerings, it is pretty enticing and exciting. I wish if this store was close to my office, then I could go there more often..."
"Well this is heartbreaking...I just found out my favorite ongiri place is now closed and replaced by Cafe Zaiya... I really hope they re-open at a new location because no one makes onigiris like they do. I miss those delicious balls of rice warped in seaweed already :(.I heart this place. It is the best place to get authentic and delicious onigiris (rice balls). It is by far better then the onigirs served at other Japanese cafes and restaurants in New York City. The classic onigirs always seem to be freshy made to order which is a definite plus. One thing I am curious about is their Kimichi Octopus Onigiri. It is my favorite flavor ever, but you can only find this special one at Family Market @Broadway Astoria (Cafe Zaiya and Oms/b seem to deliver their goods to this little Japanese convenience store daily)..Oms/b, how can you be so pretty and taste so nasty?You have such cute storefront and your rice balls has so many different colours; yellow, green and even pink. I just could not resist get that pretty pink one:Yukari-Plum- Shiso leaf mixed with white sesame wrapped in soy paper topped by imported Kishu plum- tasted like it have been there for hours..everything is just a soggy mess....- I couldn't even finish that..Now I want to go to Japan for the oh so tasty Omusbi!.I've been wanting to try this place forever, and I finally had a chance during New Year's Eve when I was touring with friend. We just missed the lunch special but got a Set A.1. Shrimp Popcorn Onigiri - very delicious, kinda hard to eat because of the lettuce wrap. It sorta fell apart after a few bites.2. Football Rice - Your inarizushi with flavored rice. I love inarizushi!3. Hijiki - Seaweed and edamame beans mixed with rice, wrapped in yellow soy sheet. Surprising flavorful and good. 4. Miso soup - freshly made.The rice overall is perfectly cooked: sticky but not mushy. Rice is not boring at all when you know how to cook it. It doesn't get 5 stars from me because of the hours though (I can't never get to it before it closes since I live and work so far away!)..For a shop that is trying to attract patronage based on a niche, Oms/b barely does its job. While it boasts a nice variety of udon and roll options to complement their featured rice balls, the quality of the rice balls is where the problem lies. $9 for Set A gets you three rice balls and a small (really small) soup with a choice of either clam chowder or miso. Pass on the clam chowder, which felt like putting globs of (clotted) cream in your mouth. The wasabi shrimp barely had 2 or 3 cashew-sized pieces of shrimp, and the wasabi mayo simply could not be tasted. The eel rice ball is tasty two-biter, but the rice was definitely overwhelmed with soy sauce flavor. The fried chicken rice ball did come with a bit more chicken than I expected after having the first two. The chicken though, was dry and not crispy.Lastly, all three of the rice balls were served with temperature somewhere between lukewarm and cold.I hold out little hope for the other rice balls that I have not yet tried. But so far, these pose no competition to the ones at Cafe Zaiya and Chiyoda Sushi..Sore wa sugoi desu ne!Omusubi Rice is my kind of snack or light meal.  One Salmon at $2.00 and one Pickled Plum at $2.00 foots both the bill and my stomach which were made fresh on the spot as I waited.  Being exposed to Japanese culture and food from a former chapter in my adult life, I am no stranger to Omusubi.  Take me to TOKYO, please!Oms/b is a quaint cafe of traditional Japanese Omusubi in various genre of vegetarian and non-vegetarian.  Green Tea is served along with dessert of Mochi ice cream, Daifuku, Udon noodle soup, and my all-time favorite Bento Box.  Asian food and culture always fits my realm best as oppose to Western food.  Modern decor with a touch of Japanese house warming feel to add to one's dinning in or takeout experience.  Copies of ""Shukan NY Seikatsu,"" Japan's NY Weekly Newspaper is available for purchase.  A loyal reward card is available where it is my ticket to authentic Japanese cuisine.While waiting for my order a egregiously vulgar boy scream with no etiquette and uneducated manners to the associate ""Hey lady!!!"" to demand of his request.  Insolent!  The father reprimanded to his crass child ""that's not how to do it"" who subsequently also in a callous and nastily demanded a takeout carton and bag ""Give me a bag and a container so I can eat the rest to go!"" Furthermore, this same vulgar boy block the single door during my exit as I repeated ""excuse me"" numerous times only to go into deaf ears.  Aija, such vulgar and tactless, uneducated and no etiquette which I hope they should never travel to Japan as this behavior is extremely crass and incriminating vulgar.WA SUGOI!!.This place specializes in Japanese rice balls. They have many different varieties. with all different kinds of meats and/or veggies in them. It is an interesting novelty, but overall, the food and value is just so-so.I had their $7.25 special, where you can choose 3 rice balls (or croquette) with miso soup. I tried the pickled radish rice ball, fried chicken rice ball, and a spicy ground beef croquette. The items tasted relatively fresh - much better than rice balls in Japanese supermarkets which are often very dry. However, it seems that they are very stingy with the fillings. The fried chicken rice ball had a thin, tiny piece of chicken that was about 1 inch by 0.5 inch and about 95% rice. The croquette was the best of the three, with a rich spicy flavor to it.The meal overall is not very filling either.  This place is only worth trying as an interesting light snack..Yum...stumbled on this spot during my lunch break.Tasty & inexpensive rice balls and sushi. The service was pleasant & quick. I had the Chili Shrimp Rice ball (err...2 cause they were so scrummy) and then had my typical California Roll (also satisfying).Will defo stop by again as the Shrimp Tempura Rice Ball seemed to be calling my name....I saw a Groupon deal and bought one for this place. One time I stopped by here after work they were nearly out of everything that they told me to come back during lunch hours. So I return the following week during lunch and grabbed six rice balls. The rice balls are very unique and quite yummy. As a wasabi lover, I've had gotten the wasabi shrimp. The wasabi shrimp was delicious! I also love shrimp and I've gotten the fried shrimp with green tea salt, it was a little salty, but it was really good. The other rice balls I've gotten were quite tasty as well. I also gotten their corn chowder, which as a corn lover, this was mm mMm mmmm!Overall, pretty decent and tasty. Will come back here to grab some more rice balls to go =).Really *NOT FRESH* rolls or rice balls. Honestly, this place is run by Japanese people... what's going on? This is the first time I've been disappointed by a Japanese food joint when it's supposed to be authentic!NOT ONLY DOES THE FOOD NOT DELIVER *AT ALL*, there is this one nasty itch of a girl who works there. Seriously, at least deliver on the customer service end if your food sucks. After giving me 20 minutes of grief over 17 stupid cents (lady, if I had it, I would have seriously given it to you!!), she gave me the wrong change. She then took back the change she gave me and then threw the correct amt of change at me, which I had to pick up off the floor... intentional or not, the nasty little itch did not even try to apologize.Seriously, what a troll. Will never return and EVEN with the Groupon I had, I felt it was a waste of money. How are they still in business??.I stopped by today to try this place out and get a snack.  They were closing in less then half an hour so they didn't have everything on their menu.  No matter, I made my choice and off I went to eat.I like this place.  Rice balls have been one of my favorite light snacks.  I bought a few everywhere I went while vacationing in Japan.  There are premade rice balls all over NYC but they are usually cold and sometimes the seaweed is slightly limp from the being close to the rice for too long.  This place made the rice ball fresh, although I read that during lunch hour it's premade for the customers but I can't confirm that from this visit.  I saw her take out the rice from the pot and roll the rice ball so the rice was warm and fragrant and the seaweed used to wrap it all up was still nice and crispy. Yumm.... At around 2 to 3 bucks for most of the rice balls , they're only a little more expensive then premade ones everywhere else that has been sitting around for god knows how long.I also tried their chicken teriyaki burger.  Not a really a burger in any sense that we know of.  It's essentially 2 oval  shaped ""bun"" made of rice with teriyaki chicken in the center and wrapped around the whole ""burger"" middle with seaweed.  Taste really good.  Too bad it was the size of a very small yo yo (no really, look at my photo) and costs about 3 bucks. I easily ate the whole thing in two bites.  Had to satisfy my curiosity though.  If I was to rate the ""burger"" on value alone, I'll be hard pressed to give it a 2 and even then only because it was so good."
"I first ate Pio Pio a few years ago at the 34th st location and remembered i liked it back then especially the salchica and fries. Went to the bronx location and the first thing that was.. unique was the security guard greeted us snd told us what table to sit at. He then gave us the menus and went back to guarding the door. LolI liked the atmosphere inside. We ordered calmari for appetizer and these were HUGE! They were really big pieces. I was not used to onion ring sized calamari so I didn't eat much of it. It was more of a texture thing for me, the huge size of it was too rubbery and thick. It comes with a marinara sauce but this was left untouched as we went for the green sauce thats on every table instead. For a table of 3, we decided to get the matador combo. I didnt realize tostones came with this and was delighted to dip these in the garlic butter provided. The french fries were overcooked yet soggy from all of the oil. The nathans hot dogs were tasty as expectedThe rice and beans were great but these were portioned for one person! You cant share the rice and beans. I was the only one who ate the salad lol it doesnt come mixed up so you'll see one layer of tomato slices on top of each other, the avocado on the other side on top of each other, etc And lastly, the chicken was juicy and nicely flavored. However my boyfriend was not a fan at all. He kept saying the chicken smelled and tasted gamey. He also decided to order the Chicha morada drink. It had some cinnamon taste in it..I can eat from this place EVERY SINGLE DAY!!! the food is fresh,arrives hot and on time!!! Pio is my family (of 8) choice for our gatherings!!! We don't discriminate either....we'll travel to any NYC Pio.Roasted chicken? then this place should be on top of your list! Just go for it and thank me later!Glad they exist in the Bronx!.This pio pio has great seating space , food is really good . They do have a lunch special till 3pm mon+fri. They won't tell you unless you ask for it , which is unfair for people who come in not knowing . And when you do ask for the lunch special menu waiter gives you a weird look. Their sangria is horrible , Beers are almost room temperature.  Only have two options red sangria white sangria  . Trust me there is better places with good food and lots of drink options then coming here to this place !   Ohhh and parking is bad . There's no life in those waiters no greetings when you walk in the door. Then they expect a tip .  Food obviously Hass to be pre-fixed since I literally ordered five minutes and food was out , sure the rotisserie chicken been spending there for a while so that's done Rice and beans already been done  in the cold side it straight from the fridge done ..Good food, great location ,waiters are on point with there service .  Literally around the corner from where I live . Consider me a regular at this place    Try the matador combo , their shrimp soup is amazing as well . I usually get the red sangria pitcher for myself ""it's that good""..I've been going to Pio Pio for many years, food is great.  I would recommend the platters depending on the # of guest.  The Salchipapas & Chofan are really good, as well as the rotisserie chicken. Their in house green sauce is really good..I browsed through Pio Pio pricing comparing Manhattan and the Bronx. Noticed pricing was better in the this location for the matador combo $32 so since I was on my way to the Bronx, decided let me save some money and go here. Ordered there and was charged $50. When I brought up the issue to the male employee March 27 7:30pm, he brushed me off and said it's not his problem and that it's a known issue but that the owners don't care to address it. Overall, he had a nasty attitude and refused to have a civil engagement of listening to the customer. Terrible service and terrible that they know this issue to exist. It's manipulative and it doesn't speak for true integrity a business motto should follow. Won't ever eat here again! Making our Peruanos look bad!.I love Pio Pio! My favorite is their seafood! It comes in a huge pile of deliciously flavored seafood.  But their rotisserie chicken is no joke! It is so juicy, flavorful and delicious!.Very great Resturant , great quality of foodAnd  very  professional A little forgetful at times, but always makes up for it's forgetfulness.Awesome food! Great service! I celebrated my birthday here in March before the world turned upside down, and let me say the food is ALWAYS GOOD! Now in the time of COVID, Quarantine, and dining at home, they offer prompt pickup and delivery of their yums!! The arroz Chaufan never disappoints and the empanadas are flaky and flavorful. The ceviche is my hubby's fave and we've never had a bad meal here!! Please support this business in the boogie down!!.The food is amazing chicken is their thing , great service and the wine gives you that special kick after the delicious meal... always recommend"
"This place is for events, 3rd floor of a building, elevator accessible, holds 60-80 people. Tonight's show was a tribute to Elvis Presley by Jeff Krick jr. Amazing performance, great show, very personable, He gives his heart to the show, had a wonderful time. Jeff has a lot of experience thru out US and he truly shows his experience the stage. Welcomed everyone one by one. Will definitely watch him again.Besides your cover, you have to order 2 items from the menu per person. Staff is attentive, helpful. Just one of the servers was wearing Adidas sweat pants, that i cannot get over with. Other than it was a pleasant night..I went there tonight to see my friend Spiros do an acoustic set of Clapton tunes. Never been there before and paid the $20 for what was billed as one 10- 11:30 pm set.Spiros, as always, was wonderful, as was his accompanist, John Ross. The room is lovely, low lights, intimate and with good sound. Spiros played from 10 until a few minutes past 11. My friend and I each had one glass of wine and the prices were typical NYC prices. What annoyed me about the club was that the server busied himself with clearing off all the unoccupied tables during the set. It was distracting to have him going from table to table clearing off candles and menus whileSpiros was performing. It is a small room and it only took about 10 minutes to clear the tables. He should have waited. Plus, last call was a fewminutes before Spiros finished, and the server was putting chairs up on the tables all around us the minute the music stopped. We would have liked to have sat for a few minutes, chatted with Spiros a few minutes, but we were rushed out. It was early, and a Friday night. Annoying!.Like so many out of the way clubs in the City, CB is not an obvious destination for Latin jazz. Great midtown find. 3 stories up from street level in a converted east 52d street apartment -- this club has been around since 2010 and is intimate and cozy. The vibe is 1950's NYC cool -- reminiscent of West Village beat and jazz clubs from the early 1960's.I snagged some tickets to an early show (6pm) at CB on TDF. It was a convenient venue for our out of town friends -- bunkered in a midtown hotel -- with an itch for different. The show featured Andres Laprida -- a brilliant Argentinian composer/guitarist performing solo guitar -- doing some original pieces and classic Brazilian jazz and samba with Afro rhythms. Andres music is spectacular! Grammy award quality. So smooth and silky. I had Rio and Ipanema on my mind all night long. ;)CB charges a cover and has a 2 drink minimum for the shows, unless you score tix on TDF ($11 a pop) -- in which case -- the cover and mins on drinks is waived. Looks like they do 2 different shows a night -- so you have to reserve each show separately.Top Tip: Stick with wines by the glass or beer on tap or by the bottle. Mixed drinks are watered down. Tapas are forgettable so don't come hungry. Smart money says get your vittles before or after the show..What an awesome little find! This tiny live jazz club and bar is on the 3rd floor of this tiny walk up building. We came here for a mini concert one evening. The four member jazz band was outstanding and provided us a solid hour of fantastic music. The drink selection is limited but good quality..Hate the rain on the happy parade here, but our experience at at Club Bonafide was terrible.  We had been planning to see live music during out holiday visit to New York, and were pleased to change our plans to joined a family celebration for a cousin;'s 50th birthday party.  Both acts that evening sounded fine, and the fact that the club is owned by a well-regarded musician was encouraging.  But the one performance we sat through, the Blues Brothers Christmas, was worse than amateur.  They got started late for a one-hour fifteen minute show.  The act consisted of two men, dressed up to resemble the Blues Brothers, singing along to a loud and not-very-good music track.  Their comedy schtick was poor.  They broke their performance into two sets; we took advantage of the break in sets to make a quick exit, We were told we could get our money back for the second act ""Music FROM Buena Vista Social Club""; in light of our bad experience with the ersatz Blues Brothers, we were worried it would be musicians playing over another crappy track.We were at a blues show in DC the weekend before that (Deanna Bogart at The Hamilton Live); the cover price was comparable, but the music and the experience incomparably betterThere is a two-item minimum that can include both drinks and food.  I ordered the chicken nuggets and onion rings.  If there was onion in the rings, I could not taste them; the chicken nuggets were squishy and fairly tasteless.  They were supposed to come with BBQ sauce; what I got was a fraction of a plastic container of commercial BBQ sauce-in-a-bottle, not nearly enough to make up for the tasteless character of the fried items..Small cozy jazz club with great drinks and music.  We were walking back from dinner looking for a place to have a cocktail and stumbled upon this.There is a small bar area, then for a cover charge the neighboring jazz club.The bartender was friendly, attentive and skilled - he made a creative and delicious  watermelon mezcal creation, his recommendation when I gave my likes of fruity mezcal.The jazz club has a great vibe, dark with side lighting illuminating the stage. Music was great. Recommend for a night of jazz or to have a cocktail at a low key cocktail bar..Upon reaching the third floor of an unassuming entryway of Club Bonafide you will step out of a VERY TINY elevator (3 people maximum), and find yourself in a room with red walls, with a NYC 1950's vibe. The dark and vibrant lighting decorates the stage, and though space is limited, it is a very cozy dim lit venue.I was there for a Flamenco inspired show and was very pleased with the artist and venue. Well, unless you decide to order a drink or even a water then your satisfaction will start to get lower and lower. Surprisingly enough they seem to have only one (very frustrated) waiter walking around trying to take orders and deliver drinks at same time. He kept repeating, to anyone who would check on their drink status after 15mins ""I am doing my best but clearly that isn't enough for you..."" Then there was the DJ channeling the ""grumpy cat"", that guy couldn't look any more bored. I added some pictures to prove my point. I left almost feeling sorry for his miseryOk, back to the service.... We waited no joke over 20mins to receive our drinks that we ordered upon arrival and our waters right before receiving the check. Anyway, very cute venue with a good selection of shows. I will definitely go back (just with no service expectations)I will have to take a star because of the extra slow service and for that poor sad DJ sitting there looking like he is in pain..Tucked away in the much quieter Midtown neighborhood of Turtle Bay, Club Bonafide sits on the top floor of a multi level commercial building. There is an elevator in the side corridor of the lobby that will fit two of you but the walk up is not that bad.The venue has two separate spaces, a small bar area with a few high tops and the set space. This is a live music lounge featuring up and coming artist including the beautiful and talented La'Wrenne (who happens to be my cousin and the cause of my visit here). The space is small but the tables are spaced enough for easy movement. The environment is definitely very chill and intimate.I also have to say the acoustics were awesome. We were there for four acts. Every one sounded great. And as a crowd everyone was into it and having a good time especially when one of the performers broke into Bruno Mars Uptown Funk. On the downside, there is no kitchen. All you can order are snacks like nuts, chips, or popcorn so have a meal beforehand. And last the drinks were high. Even by Manhattan standards I felt. I had my own tab going and after being there for four hours it was pretty hefty.  But overall a very good experience..I was pleasantly surprised by Club Bonafide. I was invited by friends to a Neo-Soul tribute show and really didn't know any more than that and as such did not know what to expect.  The staff was friendly in this oddly charming third-floor bar that felt more like New Orleans than New York City.  The entertainment was great. The drinks were reasonably priced and the minimum per person was also reasonable (2 items per person).  My only gripe would be that there was only one waitress for the entire club during the show. She did her best-- so no fault of hers, but there could have been another server or two. Otherwise, I am intrigued, satisfied, and looking forward to checking out another show here..I had a great time here last night. I bought tickets to an event where the best of Etta James and Ella Fitzgerald was sung. This is such a Sultry, smooth, relaxed jazz club. I somehow manage to sit in the same seat every time. Pricier menu but there's no cover charge."
"It's a perfect neighborhood bar.  Wish this was still my neighborhood but we stop by when we can.It's dark, the TVs are not huge, Bud's on tap, there's a dartboard, Quick Draw, an AMI jukebox, a comfortable outdoor area for smoking, and a copy of the Post.You feel really comfortable right away even if not a regular. This bar does planned racetrack days, football pools and other typical special events. In fact this very day they're having a party to celebrate 31 years in business. I'm sorry we couldn't be there and wish them many many more years.Keep in mind it's primarily a bar, with food available at lunchtime only certain weekdays, and dinnertime all week long with the possible exception of Sunday. However that schedule gets adjusted during football season! We've been in only on weekends during the day in summer so have no experience with the food. However I feel in this kind of neighborhood bar, where the conversation's good, the folks are friendly, the barkeeps, including the owner, are welcoming and engaging, the drinks are strong and the prices fair, food is really a secondary consideration.  This is a bar. We came to drink! And we'll come again..Winchester's is a dilapidated little bar near Van Buren high school. Its only patrons at 5pm on a Tuesday seem to be older retired men and middle-aged construction workers drinking separately and alone. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't be caught dead inside such a place - but alas, I had purchased a Groupon that I wanted to redeem before the expiration date.Despite the embarrassingly small beer selection (four domestics on tap), their food was actually better than we were expecting. My friend and I shared the mozzarella sticks, waffle fries, cheeseburger, and bbq pulled pork sandwich - all of which were solid choices. The cook even came out several times to make sure everything was alright. Guess you can't judge a book by its cover, huh?.Dave was fantastic and incredibleHe is the manly manly man out of most menIncredibleAmazingSpectacular Wonderful Will be back for more.A friend of mine went  into this bar to pickup his wife and was jumped in the smoking area by three white lowlife worthless pieces of shit. They had no reason except for being  racist. My friend has a long beard and was Muslim  SO??. Does that give them the right? He was born in the USA. He was beating so bad he almost lost his eyes . He is undergoing surgery as we speak.  How did no one in this bar stop them. Where was the security?  Where was his protection.  I am so disgusting.  This is such mix neighborhood, I would have never ever expect that to happen.  This just happen last week Friday..Just ordered from here today. Don't know where to start, first my order comes and the first thing I notice was it felt light. Because I ordered a 1/2 pound burger w/ let. Tom. And onion, a fried egg and cheese. It was 1/4 pound, and It came without the let. Tom. Onion.delivery guy said it was grub hub fault. I asked that it be cooked medium, it was well done and had no essence of being cooked on a grill, as the name of the Restaurant suggest. More like microwave. The fried egg was well over cooked with hard yolk. The fries were advised as shoestring fries, it came with a hand full of steak fries. 7 fries the most. and unrecognizable slaw A total disappointment.Don't think I will order from here again. 12 dollars waisted..Great place to meet your friends and make new ones.  Clean, friendly local pub.  Restrooms are clean, great prices and cute bartenders, hee hee. Ladies night Friday's. Great place to watch sports, lots of TV's..Great place to meet your friends and make new ones. Cute bartenders, clean restrooms, great prices..This place is like Cheers. I know the locals & they always greet with a smile & look out for me. The bartenders are ALL fantastic people. Everyone is friendly & even if I go alone to read comics I end up caught in conversation & making new friends. This place is like home! The only bar I know that has the 20 ounce Magners that I love. Always order the mozzarella sticks & have the jukebox going, too!.Unbeknownst to us, this place is primarily a bar and not really an establishment for food.  But there was a groupon deal so we gave it a shot since it was nearby. The server seemed to be surprised there was a groupon for the establishment in the first place and came back out after taking our orders to ask when we bought the deal. Also he didn't even give us menus before asking us what we wanted to have. Luckily we glanced at one of the menus at the bar when we walked in. We got two burgers with fries and buffalo wings to start. The wings were dry and did not have much batter and seasoning. It took 30 minutes for the burgers to arrive after the wings and we were the only sit down diners at the place. The burgers, which we asked for medium were well done and didn't even come with lettuce and tomato. We had to ask them to bring some out to us.Then we asked for two glasses of ice water, which came with a snide remark from the bartender, since I guess we didn't order alcohol. It is ridiculous that a place that chose to put their ""restaurant"" in a groupon deal would then be surprised when people show up to redeem it. I won't be going back to this place ever again and I advise everyone else to stay away!.Awesome Peruvian ahi chicken wings with shoe string fries and mozzarella sticks!.I didn't love this place.  It was okay for a neighborhood spot I guess just expecting a little more."
"I love Takashi!!! Recently they started a Sunday brunch menu with Beef Ssam and two types of Beef Ramen!! Of course I had to get a reservation!!There are only two time slots - one at 12pm and one at 1:30pm. You have to email them and they will make the reservation for you. It feels up really quickly and if you have a party of less than 4, you will most likely have to share a table because every seat in the house is filled up!Today, we tried the regular beef ramen and the grandma's spicy ramen. Both of the bowls come with beef belly, crunchy intestines, half a poached egg, seaweed, green onions, sesame and noodles. The grandma's one also had spicy paste.Personally, I really loved the beef broth. I felt that it was so hearty and sastisfying and felt a lot less fatty than the usual pork broth that ramen is in. I really enjoyed it! It was like a big fat warm cozy full bodied hug on a brutally cold winter day. I'd definitely come back!.Still a huge fan of Takashi. Recently tried the A5 beef, and it was as soft, fatty, and delicious as one would imagine.I love this place. It's so good..This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in NY. Every time I visit the city, I have to go here as well as Joe's Pizza (which is walkable distance); yes, I go to both in one day ;).The beef short rib, beef shoulder, and garlic rib eye were all really tender and flavorful but my choice would be the garlic rib eye. I am a huge fan of garlic and the way that this meat was marinated, was a perfect pairing. Now, onto THE GO-TO DISH that I would have unlimited orders of if I could (afford it, tummy and wallet wise), is the Kobe beef/uni seaweed and perilla leaf wrap. This is just 100%; I cannot explain into words what this combination of flavor produces in your mouth, except that it is so enjoyable in every way possible and makes me utterly happy with every bite. Sadly, 1 order is only 4 pieces so when you share with someone (I do not know why I decided to do such a thing), you only get 2 pieces to yourself. . . * cries * They have a waitlist where you put down your phone # upon arrival and then they call you when your table is ready. See why I make a stop at Joe's in between? Our wait was a little over an hour but it was really worth it. I mean it! Restaurant is small and it gets smokey in there from all the grilling, but the restaurant staff is nice enough to store your coats for you in another smoke-free room. Ugh, I miss this place already and can't  wait to go back at my next visit to NYC!.5/5 for the midnight ramen. Best ramen in New York City. For sure. The ramen only is available during midnight, and takes reservation. Only have two options, the original and the spicy. I tried the spicy one. Perfect spice, perfect beef, and the noodle itself. Delicious! Definitely will come back!4/5 for the bbq, one star is deducted for the high price. Spent 100+ per person with another 6 people..Food was fine and the service was great.We ordered five meats for grill, some salad, some buns and some rice balls. The flavor was okay and the meat was very fresh.The overall price was a little expensive for the amount of meat you got. Choices were little if you like a variety of vegetables apart from meats. Take reservations for a group of four of more..Review for Midnight Ramen only:If every midnight snack/meal could be Takashi's ramen, I would be a VERY happy (and plump) camper! Takashi's Original Ramen is unlike most I've had before - the bowl is filled with braised Kobe beef belly and crispy fried intestines, all cooked in a rich beef broth and topped with seaweed, sesame seeds, and thinly sliced green onions. If you're not the type to try intestines, don't let it throw you off. The intestines taste more like small crispy chunks of beef and give the ramen a wonderfully addictive and flavorful texture...even a few of my friends who don't like intestines loved it! On top of that, the dish includes a creamy soft boiled egg in it, which is actually a rarity since most other NYC ramen shops now charge eggs as additional side items. Definitely a winner here.Midnight Ramen is only available Fridays and Saturdays from 12am - 1am, so be sure to call or email to make your reservation in advance. Highly recommend it for a late night craving..This wasn't my pick but I'm glad I went. My friend made reservations here for dinner. We tried a variety of dishes from the squid ink rice, to the foie gras meatball, the niku uni, the brain cream, bone marrow dumplings and a few more dishes that I can't recall. The squid ink rice was tasty, the foie gras meatball wasn't my favorite because it was very sweet and chocolatey, the niku uni was great,  the brain cream was the highlight and the bone marrow was just par. The waitress pours extremely hot oil on the bone marrow for it to cook.Overall a great experience. A bit expensive. Dinner was approx $650 for 5 people..My friends have been raving about this place, so I was pretty excited to try it out. It's a small little place, so make sure to get reservations (4+ people, they don't take reservations for smaller groups). Luckily, we were able to get a seat right away on a Wednesday night for 3 people. We started off with the Niku Uni which was pretty good. For the meats, we go 2 orders of the filet mignon, 1 order of short rib, and 1 order of the ribeye to share. The short rib and filet were delicious, both very fatty and tender. The garlic butter sauce definitely made it even better though. The ribeye was okay, tougher than the other meats we had. Quality overall for everything was great. Service was great as well, everyone was really attentive and helpful. They tell you the recommended cooking time for each meat and how to cook it. The only con about Takashi for me is the portion size for the price, which makes it hard to try a large variety. The short rib and ribeye came with about 6 thin slices. Filet was a bit more, but not by much. I don't think you can really get ""filled up"" here without spending $$$. We ordered 3 bowls of rice so that helped..Takashi is not how it used to be. It has definitely fell off. I was so disappointed when I brought three friends to try this amazing meal I once had. First things first, the service here was a bummer. It was so hard to get a hold of the server's attention in a approx. 7 table restaurant. The server was also very difficult to understand. And guess what? She included all these add-ons onto our bill that we did not order! I felt like something was off with the portions, She really tried to play it off. They ended up taking off one entire item off the bill but that's standard service. As for the food, we ordered a few premium cuts, the tongue experience, filet mignon and a variety of chef's horumon.  we were not all that impresesd. My friends are not from here and came just to try what was supposedly my favorite yakiniku restaurant. I've had a few amazing meals here before and had always raved about it.Let's just say, I've been planning this dinner for months. I'm embarrassed that my friends and I were so disappointed..{Overall: 4.5; Food: 4.5} Service: 4; Atmosphere: 4The food was delicious. The schtick here is more exotic cuts of meat which make up the majority of the meat menu (stomach, calf brains, etc.). We weren't adventurous enough to try those this time, but people at other tables were loving it!*US Kobe Kalbi & Rosu: So delicious - melt in your mouth, very fresh, delicious umami/beef flavor. Probably the best beef I have had in NYC.*Grandmon's Steamed Beef Shank Buns: The spicy mayo was delicious (albeit not at all spicy, ha); I was putting it on everything; the meat was tender and succulent. The buns were so soft and chewy.*Bakudan: Rice balls in nori or sesame leaves.*Homemade Madagascar Vanilla Soft Serve: An elevated version of the classic. So sweet with a really great vanilla taste. Add a few toppings like mochi. The service was good, sometimes felt *a little* rushed, but that's understandable given it's a very popular place. Small portions. Was told it would be a 2.5 hour wait, but actually ended up being 40 minutes! Recommend for a special occasion. Unless you're rich, then just a regular dinner I guess..For the last few years I've been trying to eat here with little success.  Mostly because of bad timing since the place is always packed.  This time my wife and I got there at opening and was able to score a table for an hour before all the reservations showed.  So was it worth it?  I have to say the service was impeccable, the restaurant itself is a little slice of heaven in the city with its quaint and cozy setting.  However, I'm torn on the food.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I think I'm a victim of my own circumstance.  Building up my excitement and expectations of my eventual experience at this establishment due to years of reading the reviews, seeing all the pictures and just all of the overwhelming accolades pouring in.  The food was good just not as good as I built it up to be in my head.  Certainly should not stop anyone from going.  Just don't make the mistake I did and expect this epic culinary adventure of the taste buds."
"We loved this place, very cozy and has a great family atmosphere.  The food was very good, the quantity and perfect presentation, the house wine totally recommended.  Simply amazing dessert.  Excellent service and atmosphere.  It is a place to recommend and return..Always an amazing atmosphere in here. The food and the staff are great. It's a very welcoming and warm neighborhood staple..Visited the location and took my team to a business lunch. They sat us right away the service was good and the ambience was very nice. All the food ordered was delicious and they serve large portions. So be prepared to eat. Over all a very good experience. If you are in Williamsburg Brooklyn I recommend you give them a try..What a wonderful authentic Italian restaurant!Mateo was our waiter and he was wonderful.I had the homemade buffalo mozzarella with basil and tomato.my husband had the veal Franchese. it was light and they don't use butter. and our friend had the chicken Marsala.Bread arrived in a basket warm with butter.They don't serve American coffee only espresso and cappuccino. They have a lovely room in the back that holds about 30/35 people for private events at very reasonable prices.Williamsburg has changed a great deal so it's so nice to still have one of the original Italian restaurants in the neighborhood..I went to this place on a Friday afternoon when there was basically no one there and asked for wifi and a bottle of wine and an appetizer which translates into a $50 check. After 1.5 hours they cut the wifi off (even though no one was there) and when I asked what happened they said the wifi cuts off after some time because there reservations coming in... I find that very offensive, they could have just asked me to leave when other people show up... The grilled octopus was too sour btw but the house cab was nice and fruity.What can I say about this hidden treasure in Williamsburg? As someone born and raised here, this has always been a wonderful place to dine. This isn't your typical NYC Italian joint. Though you can get the basics (chicken parm...etc...) the real greatness is rooted in the outstanding recipes from Italy and those that are made from Italian tradition but given a new American breath. The service is wonderful. The owners are delightful, kind, and love what they do. Whenever anyone ever asks for a place to dine in Williamsburg, I always and will continue to point them here!.First time here my friend invited me to dinner with our daughters who love pasta. Let me tell this is a cute one this restaurant is. It's small but lovely it makes you feel like a family here. Definitely kids friendly place. The inside reminds me of a cabin in the Poconos area. I will definitely coming back here often the food that We try was soooo yummy, unfortunately some of the pictures didn't came out too good, but trust me you won't regret coming here. They have a small cute little bar in the back where you get your drinks from..I'm severely lactose intolerant (forgot to tell them) and ate the whole plate of Long Fusilli con L'angostino with cream sauce. All I can say is that it is worth the pain. 100 times over..One of the best places to go in the neighborhood. Family run spot with great service and excellent food. Reasonable prices and they offer very nice specials and delicious desserts, many of which are homemade!.The best Italian restaurant in Williamsburgh and I am Italian and was born and raised here."
"This place is perfect no complaints .but the delivery lady took forever 35-40 mins to pick up my order and to top it off  my food was super cold burger cold fries cold nuggets 10 pct cold to top it off have a cold meal with cold drink I think its unprofessional with no delivery bag to keep the food hot stick to Uber eats.This place is the worst...I told the drive thru lady exactly what I wanted twice. They charged me $34.00 yet shorten me 2 orders of 10 piece nuggets smh. I dont get how these people take your order & charge you BUT don't put everything you ordered in the bag smh.WORST WENDY'S IN EXISTENCE. Refused service because noone was there to take order at window..This is not my first time coming to this Wendy's but it certainly will be my last. The employee who rang me up has no idea what it means to cover her mouth so that she doesn't spread her germs all over the place. I placed my 4 for $4 to-go order along with 2 double chocolate cookies, 2 chocolate chip cookies, and 2 sugar cookies. As I waited for my order I decided to walk over to the soda machine. The machine needs to be changed because I tried three different brands of soda and they all tasted like a Soda Stream commercial. I ended up settling on Dr. Pepper Cherry which tasted better than the last three sodas I sampled. As I waited for my to-go order I noticed that it was incorrect. I told the cashier that I'm missing items. She gave me a blank stare and said I charged you for the cookies. I said yeah but there should be six in total. She said I'll give you cookies. I was totally over waiting for my order to be ready. I told her forget it and walked out..If I could make this a even lower rating I would.  Every time we come here the people who work here are just nasty. Never smiling, never polite, they get orders wrong and then do not care if they do. Nor do they want to fix their mistakes. Save yourself the agony of dealing with these rude people and go across the street to McDonald's..This particular wendy's is really good for there large parking lot, and there drive trough window for your convenience. my wife really likes there baked potatoes with cheese .and there daves single burgers and the topping also.she also likes there frosties in the summer time to go with the meal.the staff always seem to nice up there..I know deep in my soul that this fast food isn't the way lol but at this time a frosty, double stack , and possibly nuggets or a chili seemed like a decent idea... I was wrong. My heart goes out to anyone in the hospitality industry but especially fast food workers. Surely after plenty repeating that they do not have any coins and so on and such the cashier is not in a joyous place, but I do believe that each person should be treated accordingly and I have the utmost respect for all humanity. We all have our limits, I waited patiently after a long wait and contact with plenty of low lives and just scum to put it bluntly and I still was respectful but when my food was received it was clear that the staff had checked out after a long day but when I asked for a refund it just amplified the extremely BAD  energy flow to receive 5$ back so to all I would honestly say do on to others as the relevant saying goes. No chance I'll be caught again salivating on Jamaica ave for any sorts of various poison lmaooo. Blessings to you all.No potatoes, no ketchup??? Wtf What do they have? Half the menu? And the staff has an attitude about it to the customer?.Too inept to handle a refund. Don't waste your time just file a chargeback. Can't even get a consistent answer from managers..Good Place if Your Hungry after MidnightAlthough the restaurant entrance is closed however the Driveway is open , I believe until 4/5am ... I love the fries and fish burger at times, but you must make sure the fries are fresh because I have had times where they give you cold fries .."
"My roommate and I have now been ordering King's Pizza delivery once a week for over a year. This is where you want to order your pizza from!! Other pizza crust now feels like cardboard in my mouth. Somehow the medium, large, and extra large magically all come out to nearly the same price, at least with only one topping. So do yourself a favor and order an extra large- you'll get leftovers and a free included liter of soda..Amazing!! When I think of pizza, I think about that New York authentic Street pizza. Not, to thick, not to doughy and just the right amount of sauce. That first bite had that crisps to it. The only bad thing I can say about this pizza is for my liking the sauce was a bit on the sweeter side. Otherwise, great flavor pretty big size not cheap with the cheese, I would definitely recommend this place..This Pizza shop has been in Harlem going on 20 years now. And the customer service always polite and cool. This is our community so they treat us with respect. And the pizza is so delicious I always get the pepperoni or the hamburger slice is the bomb. Definitely a go to spot for me..This is My Go to Pizza Shop where the Love is Authentic and the Service in welcoming. In the heart of my hometown #Harlem you'll find the best pizza made with love. My Guys are the koolest... you wanna know what's happening in Harlem stop by King's Pizza.Fine food but prices seen other places online are WRONG. like not just kinda wrong like my order was double what I expected wrong. I went in person and the owner explained that he knows this but for some reason can't fix it. Be warned..BEST PIZZA IN HARLEM... Been Going For Years Never Been Let Down...(Prices Recently Went Up 25 Cent )    A Sicilian Is Now 3.25  && Worth Every Cent !.I've been ordering pizza from here for over 10 years! Other pizza places around Harem simply do not compare. My only complaint is that they charge a lot just for one pie but because they're a mom and pop shop, I guess they have to charge much. If you like the oil dripping and cheese falling over, then this is the place for you. If not, I recommend going to domino's across the street. I also wouldn't attempt specialty pizzas. Stick to the basics and you'll love it too!.Really wouldn't recognize this shop if just driving by however this particular day I was in a rush and had a craving for pizza. I ordered my pizza and paid and as I told my first bite and to head out, I turned back around and sat down to finish devouring this slice. I mean the crust was to damn near perfection, the slice was larger than your normal size and it was fresh! To this day, the only place for pizza id recommend in Harlem!.Best NY pizza in the neighborhood. I'm so happy that I found Kings and would recommend it to anyone looking for great pizza. Delivery is always fast and if you don't have cash they accept credit card over the phone. (Although note that the receipt will not have a line to add a tip so you should have a few bucks ready.).Great pizza, but don't go here for service. Cause they are  grumpy old men, but they got the pizza making down and delicious."
"Super small restaurant and service isn't the best BUT the food makes up for everything. This is one of my favorite places to get authentic Dominican food in Queens. Whether you pick it up or dine in the flavors are amazing. My favorite dish on their menu is the bistec encebollado (Steak & onions) with rice and a side of maduros (sweet plaintain). I was also very impressed with their sancocho since I'm not a huge soup fan. I've had their steak sandwich as well which is huge and very filling. My sister loves getting the chicarrón de pollo - literally melts in your mouth. Get the passion fruit juice!! You won't regret it. You also can't beat the prices..3/1/20 update !!! This place never fails me !!!! It's so delicious and it's my favorite Dominican restaurant ever ! I've been coming here for years and I intend to come back as much as I can ! I love the bistec encebollado it's sooooo delicious. The rice and beans are amazing and the queso frito is mouth watering. I had all of this today so I just wanted to say it was great and this restaurant is bomb !!!!.I've been coming here for years so this review is LONG overdue. This has to be my absolute favorite Dominican restaurant ever ! My favorite dish is the steak with onions, tostones ( make sure to order the garlic sauce on the side for dipping & limes ), rice and beans, and queso frito. The fried cheese is cooked perfectly and the steak is so tender and juicy. The onions are amazing because they melt in your mouth especially if you mix it with the rice and beans ! YUM! I can't wait to go back ! Thank you Chris for making my experience here so amazing each time. The food never disappoints me. I would recommend everyone to come here and try it out. Another reason why I love it is because it's open late till 1:30 am. Thanks for being so delicious!P.S the salad dressing here is my favorite.Im surprised this spot has so many bad reviews let me begin by their amazing customer service ! The women who answers the phone every time i call for delivery is such a sweet heart. Let me also mention their delivery is super fast if you live within the area. I love ordering from here !.I tried this place thinking it couldn't be so bad, since they had an ok rating.  The food was awful!!!!  Lunch with beef stew, rice, and beans had a funny after taste.  Mofongo was absolutely old and microwaved.  Everything was absolutely disgusting.  Prices were comparable and portions, but I ended up throwing the food away since it was just that gross.  I'm not sure how they stay in business with poor quality food and they lie about tax.  $17 plus tax according to them is $19, which should actually be $18.51 not $19.  I don't mind giving extra money but that food was DISGUSTING.  Mofongo was so dark I will attach a photo.  This is by far the worst Dominican food I've ever tasted..Coming from Florida, I found this restaurant by chance . It's absolutely phenomenal. The food is delicious. Service was too notch. I highly recommend this restaurant..I am not going to eat in this place . They serve rotten meat La carne guisada estaba podrida tenia un olor abinigrada ( the beef stew smell rotten) i gave to my dog and my dog didn't want to eat it either..Favorite Dominican food spot E V E R. Mondongo by far the best .. everything is soooo good. The ladies are very nice. I've been coming here for years!.This place for a long time has gone down hill. The passion isn't there anymore and its sad. Makes me sad because in a place where you sould represent our national food they are not:( and i was over priced for what i got..This was my second experience eating Dominican cuisine. I was in the area and decided to yelp a place to eat and this restaurant popped up. I had the Yuca Empanadas, mofongo and the oxtails.The Yuca was a little salty for me and the filling was just ground beef. Expected a bit more for a two dollar menu item.Mofongo was a bit starchy and hard to be at but it came with a delicious gravy and shrimp.The oxtail was on point. Couldn't get any better than fall off the bone oxtails with a delicious sauce. Staff was a bit rough especially for a non Spanish speaker. There was quite a bit of yelling back and forth between the staff..Quisqueya is the Taino name for the Dominican Republic and thus, they serve typical Dominican food at this restaurant.  It serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner and staples of the DR so I consider this to be a Dominican diner.  Mangu for breakfast, plates for lunch, mofongo whenever you want. If you are a cheapie, come for breakfast.  You can get the ""tres golpes,"" a filling portion of meat (fried salami, longaniza, etc, fried cheese, mangu/tostones, fried eggs) for only $6. Add a morir sonando (OJ with some milk and sugar), maybe some coffee and you will be in a food coma. Don't forget the chicharron de pollo, the tasty fried chicken of the DR that won't disappoint.  Some of the joints in Corona don't take credit card, but this one does so score."
"Have you ever had a magical night? My wife Shirley treated me to dinner for my 60th birthday and we fell in love with the southern Italian cuisine of Bartolinos.Upon entering we met another couple who after hearing it was my birthday generously ordered us a second glass of wine with our dinner. We chatted like we were old friends. Maira, our very personable server along with Juned her trusty assistant made sure they catered to our every need. From the perfectly baked Focaccia bread through our sumptuous Eggplant Rollatini appetizer you could tell everything was homemade with the freshest ingredients and the utmost of care.It wasn't long before the head Chef Jerry Pasquale came by to see we were happy with our meal. He must have heard me squealing with delight as I devoured my Seafood Pescatore over freshly made linguini. Shirley thoroughly enjoyed her Salmon asa Ciento over spinach. Did I mention cooked to perfection with handmade pasta and homemade gravy. Maravilloso!I rarely order dessert, but when Maira insisted we decided on their Tiramisu. Shirley and I consider ourselves Tiramisu connoisseurs. Over the last 14 years we have enjoyed Tiramisu all over The City, even having a Tiramisu wedding cake. Chef Jerry Pasquale's Tiramisu is by far the best we have ever had, and we felt we just had to let him know. Jerry explained he is from Catanio Sicily and takes great pride in the work he puts into preparing his menu. His Tiramisu is made with the most important ingredient of all LOVE. This man loves to cook for you. Juned, Maira and Chef Jerry Pasquale made my 60th a magical night to remember at Bartolinos..Crazy Expensive, food was mediocre at best and half was cold, the only good thing was the focaccia.would not recommend.Does have parking in the back which was great ..Amazing customer service. My order was dropped because of a technical issue but they made sure to reach out to me about the issue and try to make sure I was taken care of. Really appreciate how Larry took care of things. Will be returning.Always consistently good Italian food and good service. No wonder they've been around so long..I Didnt like my experience here at all...I ordered a $40 bottle of white wine, I asked to Confrim if it was in stock the waitress said yes i said cool.The busser comes and says we don't have that bottle I have this one would you like it.. I was gonna say YES because I'm open to try new bottles but something told me to read about it I said may you show me which one this is on the list... he showed me and it was a $80 bottle. I personally felt like i was being played if your gonna offer me something offer me something similar and if you do want me to get the $80 bottle please UPSELL IT tell me WHY this bottle is better, let me taste it do a little more.. because of this experience I Probably wont come back. If i would of said yes as fast as i was going to I would of been confused at the end to the $80 charge..I always have a wonderful experience when I dine in, even when I order for delivery it still taste delicious with a good quantity..will definitely recommend..Why or why does this restaurant fail to take COVID 19 seriously. Every time I have ordered or walked by you see waiters who don't or won't wear their masks properly a musician who does not social distance and at the beginning of the summer cramped street tables blocking much of the sidewalk.Last Saturday I went out to try Bartolinos. It was a quiet night with only a dozen or so patrons and after looking through the menu I chose a chicken pasta with vodka sauce. The meal was tasty though a bit on the heavy side with a large portion of food. I ordered a soda and ate the meal, which came over $30.00.There was good teamwork amongst the employees, however, I had to repeat myself several times to order my drink. The manager or owner came around and apologized for the delay in the preparation of my dish. I told him everything was very tasty and shook his hand which was not a terribly warm experience. He then prowled the dining area and found a group of customers at the rear of the restaurant who he liked or seemed to identify. I guess he did not figure I was a regular even though I had eaten at pizza joint many times.Was my experience a good one. The food was tasty, but a little on the large side in terms of portioned food. Service was adequate -though as I mentioned I had to repeat myself several times.On ambiance the restaurant was clean, but on that particular day lacked atmosphere. There was no effort to cultivate new customers like me or sort of. I am going to give them a pass on the wait time, but the prowling was a little off-putting.Would I go back? Yes, I want to give them another look, but I would probably get with a friend..This place throws loud parties in their back parking lot that goes on for hours during weeknights, that wake us up on Sundays and continue to be a nuisance all day. No social distancing, no respect for their community and neighbors. Don't know how they're not shut down yet. Disgraceful..On a Thursday weekdays night this restaurant did not care the people in this neighborhood needs to sleep. Playing extremely loud music and making noice all night straight from 7pm. HORRIBLE.The owner was violating city guidelines by allowing people to sit in the sidewalk..which he doesn't have a permit to do. He literally closed off the sidewalk with a bunch of massless customers. He should be ashamed"
"This pizza place popped my cherry by introducing me sesame crust with vodka sauce pizza pie. It's so damn good! I ordered many different kind pizzas from them and it's never a disappointment. My favorite is Vodka sauce pizza, pesto with fresh tomatoes and mozzarella, fresh margarita mozzarella pie and eggplant pie. My father is obsessed with their rice balls.Their pizza style is regular crust, not too thin or too thick. I knew this place when it was Krispy and now it's Marianna's. I was sad when I find out it wasn't Krispy anymore and I didn't know one of the owners stayed behind. Boy was I happy he stayed behind. This is one of my go to place! You won't be disappointed! And yes I'm picky with my pizza. expo.silive.com/life-and….Ordered from seamless for delivery. Waited over an hour. Tried to call and no one answered. App said food was on its way and never came.  I decided to go there and when I got there, it was closed. I had 2 small hungry children with me... very disappointing. Will never order from here again.One of the best pizza in Staten Island! The tomato sauce tasted fresh and delicious and the pizza crust was just perfect!  I'm coming back for more! The staff is also very nice and friendly!.I ordered the artichoke pie... so good! I typically don't eat pizza and it's never my go to choice of food but I decided to give this place a try since I live around the corner. The people here are really nice and the pizza is really good. Will definitely be back to try other items..Moved to SI 5 months ago and live like 4 minutes away but today was the first time I tried Marianna's. Started with a regular slice and a margarita slice both amazing, great sauce. Have a long list of things a want to try, will be back for sure!.This was the worst meal that I have ever had in my entire life. I can honestly say that with no exaggeration. The pizza was burnt and had very little sauce. The meatballs were like eating foam. The shrimp scampi was over cooked. The food lacked any flavor. I was thoroughly disappointed..Their vodka pie is my favoriteeee.. and usually the krispys chicken salad. But the chicken tonight was definitely not fresh like usual..This is my go-to spot!! I love everything I have ever ordered from Marianna's. The pizza is always crispy, never floppy, and always delivered in a timely fashion! Their sauces are so delicious and taste like your grandmas homemade sauce. Some things you must try:Vodka pie! Sesame seed crust!!! Enough said.Grandma pie. So delicious and perfect crunch. Riceball parmEggplant rollatini in vodka sauceIf you haven't tried, you need to..The best pizza on Staten Island! Always comes hot and super quick!!! Very friendly staff answering the phone! Delicious!!!!!.With so many good pizzerias around the area, this little place shines. Their vodka pizza is freaking amazing. Sesame seed crust is so unique. They have so many specialty slices on display I don't know what to have. I went with what the reviews said and tried the vodka. I also tried their chicken ranchero, so good! I'm definitely going to make this my new pizza spot."
"Tasty pizza! Just like the one in Brooklyn location.Just be aware, the seating area is so small and I think there is only 4 tables there.I love their pesto and eggplant parm pies, the best!.Worst pizza experience ever! I read other reviews and was very excited to try Krispy Pizza. Having grown up in Brooklyn I try new pizza whenever I get the chance. Friends even call me a pizza snob which is a badge I wear with pride!Unfortunately I never got the chance to taste Krispy Pizza! I walked up and there was an older man sitting outside the door in a chair. He looked like he worked there since he was wearing all white. I smiled at him and he just ignored me. I went inside where I just found a younger guy mopping floors. He also ignored me until I asked him for help. It seemed as if they had closed early but forgot to lock the door?? He took off his gloves and washed his hands as if he was going to help me. He headed out the door to get the old man who originally ignored me and was outside with his shoes off scratching his feet. He obviously had no interest in helping me since he knew I was there and never got up. At that point between his attitude and the fact that he was scratching his feet, I was disgusted and walked out. I will never return to Krispy pizza!!.Worst pizza experience ever! I read other reviews and was very excited to try Krispy Pizza.

I will never return to Krispy pizza!!Hi John, I am not sure at this time when I was there. If you can see the date I posted the original review that is the date. I posted shortly after leaving. Thank you for your response. Judy.I am finally done with Krispy Pizza.  I have been a loyal supporter for quite some time now.  I order delivery  from them usually every other week and pick up a number of times too.  My boyfriend orders the same dish every time, chicken parm with vodka sauce on both the chicken and pasta.  The first time they got the order wrong, I called them to see if they could send us a replacement dish, as my boyfriend does not eat regular tomato sauce.  They rudely responded that we did not specify vodka sauce, when I explained that we did, they said we did not specify on the chicken.  I explained yet again that I did and he said ""well next time you have to clarify better.""  I'm not quite sure how saying ""can I have chicken parm with vodka sauce on both the pasta and the chicken"" was not clear, but ok.  They continued to mess up our order a number of times afterwards but I was so annoyed that they insinuated it was our fault that I never called back after.Tonight I ordered the same dish again, the same dish I order every time.  My boyfriend placed the order and I heard him say his order and specify he wanted vodka sauce on both the pasta and the chicken, and say that he had to specify because they always get our order wrong.  When the food was delivered, he opened up the container and it was shrimp parm, not chicken.I am tired of spending $15 each dish to get food that we don't like and didn't order.  On the plus side, the food is usually pretty good, but don't ever order delivery from them.  There are enough pizzerias in this area that I can order from that won't mess up my order every time.  I definitely will never order from them again..Wandered in here today for a slice, and it was very good. Thin, crunchy, cheese and sauce not bad . Place is kept very clean . If in the area you should definitely stop in . I will definitely be going back..My favorite pizza place of all time. Vodka slices are incredible. Can't believe they closed! Hope they open another SI location..First time stopping at this pizzeria and it is very clean and nice looking ... but I had a chicken parm hero that was the most sketchy thing I have ever eaten the sandwich was very bland and honestly got me and my bf sick to are stomachs worst decision ever!!!!!  never again!.Amazing staff. I work at a local preschool who orders about 11-20 pies for the school. They are amazing and open up early to make the pizza and deliver the pies on time. When we go for there for the lunch specials everything is fresh and tastes amazing. If I had the money I would go back every day for pizza..We LOVE krispy's.. we order almost once a week! Moving from Brooklyn we thought we couldn't find a pizzeria that meant our standards but krispy's is amazing.. It's the best pizza and has great hero's as well.. always fresh and delicious..We may have been starving, but this was the best pizza we've had! The pizza lives up to it's name - krispy! From its bathroom amenities to their customer service krispy's doing it right. My mouth is still watering.My all time favorite pizzeria. Always delicious and Krispy pizza that me and my family love."
"BKNY THAI is a hidden gem. The food is tasty and the service is really great. The waiters and waitresses are attentive. I went with my kids after a movie trip and they wanted something different. I found BKNY on my favorite go to website - say it with me, ""YELP""! The curry my daughter ordered was good, she loved the sticky rice and spices. My son enjoyed the food - chicken wings with pineapple rice. He asked if we could come after the movies and we've been there once again for the same orders. Yet again no complaints and their belly's were full. I think we'll make this our go to after the movies at AMC fresh meadows location - 10 mins away. We always leave with plenty of leftovers so for me it's PERFECT! One issue I had was I ordered two orders of wings and they brought two orders on one plate. The wings looked like they got mugged- extra small. I told the waiter that's not what I ordered and he said he would speak to the cook. He came back and apologized but wasn't able to give extra wings. I'm only bringing it up so it doesn't happen to another Yelper or other guest reading this post. . ENJOY!.Our dishes were pretty average or a notch below average for the area. Their spiciness level was on point, so that's a big plus.However, the pad baby corn was very liquidy, and the dish was pretty meh, especially for the price. The sausage fried rice was spicy, as we requested, but the spiciness really masked any flavor. Lastly, the duck roll had a very odd wrapper, not like anything I've ever had with Thai food.For the price of the dishes, at least for delivery, I'd try someplace else..great local thai spot. We live super close by and can't believe it took so long to try it out especially since my husband is a big fan of Thai cuisine. Came on a friday evening and the main dining room was packed. The back patio was not open but it didn't look like it needed to be. Service was good and food came out in a good pace. to eat we had:Ribs with sticky rice: we had this as an appetizer. very tasty and ribs are super tender. it's a little on the sweet side but it goes really well with the sticky rice. Pad kee Mao with pork: good flavors, just the right amount of heat. Tom Ka Gai: soup was delicious. it's creamy but light and acidic at the same time. BKNY mixed special: with shrimp, mussel, squid, scallop, and veggies in a peppercorn sauce. I had this prepped mild and it was awesome. she gave me the chili sauce on the side so I can adjust the heat myself. the seafood was all cooked perfectly and the portion was just right. delish!overall a pretty decent Thai restaurant! will be back to try more items next time!.This is a great local Thai restaurant, been coming for years and still going. Food is always on point and has great taste. Service is always very good and place is well kept and spacious. Man we always order so much when coming here because everything is really good. A lot of Thai restaurants are normally smaller and tight. This place is huge. I like how also most employees seem to be Thai which I think is always nice. Portion sizes are always good. Price wise I think they are pretty fair as far as Thai food goes. They have a nice sized menu and lots to offer. Nice that they also have a bar with beers and cocktails. If around I would say for sure stop by and give them a try, you will not be disappointed..Been coming here for years now and the food has been consistent and staff is friendly. I like the soups and appetizers they offer. Alway a fan of the Thai ice tea. They have a nice size bar and offer a good amount of different drinks. Place is big and good for larger parties. Also a party area downstairs. This place is still one of the better Thai places. Food is on point..Pretty good food and decor. Nice size restaurant, good for party's and larger groups. Service is not bad a bit slow at times. Decent size portions. Has a private parking lot in back..Definitely wanted to come back to BKNY's yelp page to update my review. After the awesome experience I had hosting my friend's baby shower here in the past, I knew from the get-go that I wanted to host my husband's 40th birthday party here as well. Due to the large size of our group on a Saturday evening, we were given the outdoor space in the back and let me tell you, what they have done with the space is breathtaking. The flower arches were so beautiful that it saved me a LOT of time on decorations for the party! The BKNY team (as usual) were superb and helped me rearrange the entire setup of the tables and chairs in the back to suit my needs and # of guests. I was worried that it might be chilly in the evenings not realizing that they even installed heater units on the inside so the temperature was perfect all night! They designated a server (shoutout to Joe!) specifically for our party and he was spectacular, so attentive and helpful throughout the night. Despite the fact that they had a packed house in the front, everyone's food/drinks came out in a timely fashion and not once did we feel rushed. They generously told us to take our time and enjoy, allowing us to stay until closing. All our guests complimented on how delicious the food was and how generous the portions were! This was my second time working with Michelle as our coordinator and she never disappoints. I cannot say enough great things about the BKNY team and want to thank you all again for your hard work and making my husband's birthday party a success!.Hosted my best friends baby shower here and just wanted to rave about their top notch service. Booking our event was a seamless process from beginning to end. Half of the main room was allocated to our party, giving us plenty of space to walk around, play games, and take group photos. They were very accommodating and allowed us to go in bright and early to set up. The staff was super attentive with our guests throughout the entire shower. Food and drinks were aplenty and delicious! We all had a wonderful time and want to thank the staff again for going above and beyond to help make this day extra special :).I am obsessed with this restaurant. Ever since I visited, I have not stopped thinking about their food. When I visited, I ordered the roti chicken massaman curry for the table as an appetizer, as well as the chicken pad see ew and Thai iced tea. The curry appetizer was the perfect size for two people. It came stocked with all the same ingredients as the entree massaman curry, and was essentially just a mini form of the entree. The roti it came with tasted light, fresh, and delicious. The Thai iced tea was pretty standard, but also very tasty. For the entree, they let you choose the spice level you like. I ordered my pad see ew at medium spice level and it was the perfect level of spicy to enjoy all the flavors but still feel a little heat. The service is friendly, and I've had good luck with parking in the area. If you're looking for casual Thai food where you can enjoy the dine in experience, definitely give this place a try!.I heard of this restaurant for awhile but was never in the the area during meal time.   I made a trip here just try check it out after ordering pickup. Without GPS I will probably miss it.  There is a small parking lot in the back, which was full on a weekday lunch hour.  Entrace from parking lot is the back of restaurant where you pass through the tented outside/extended dinning area.   There is good number of seating inside and outside, so if you dine-in there shouldn't be a wait.   The décor is kind of non-Thai style, looks more like a bar/restaurant than what I expecting a Thai cuisine would be decorated. I ordered the regular menu, not the lunch menu was expecting this will get more food for paying extra.  Well, even for me, weight under 145lb need to eat two order.   Taste is not above average if not for the price I would give it 5 stars.  Even when I ask for highest spicy level it's not that spicy so it's good for general dinner who might not be used to Thai food.  I asked for side chili in fish sauce and that fixed it..Okay so ya'll. I am not the biggest fan of Thai food only due to have an underwhelming experience at a different restaurant years ago. But this restaurant is so good! Came here with my homegirl for a quick bite and drinks and everything was great. We sat in what is considered the outdoor section though it is covered. Our waitress was also very sweet and attentive throughout our entire stay.My homegirl and I both ordered the lychee martini which was really good. The calamari was great and we ordered the crab meat fried rice and chicken and shrimp pad thai. 10/10. This is coming from someone who always hated pad thai.Would recommend this place and try other things. Hopefully my future experiences won't change this 5 star review..We love going to this place for special occasion. We were just here for Valentine's Day this year. We get the chicken curry puffs, chicken satay, red curry and pad Thai. These dishes are delicious and tasty. Staff is super friendly. Recommend it if you come visit bayside..Great food, great drinks, great service, excellent ambiance. It was my first time trying BKNY. First things first they have a parking lot and lots is street parking. And lunch specials until 3:30pm. The food was great I ordered the shrimp basil fried rice it was a little spicy but it was still good. I tried my friends pineapple fried rice that was very flavorful. The drinks were great I'd highly recommend the peach sangria it'll give you a good buzz. I can't quite remember the name of the spjked Thai ice tea but you won't miss it on the menu. It's Thai iced tea with baileys and rum. Soo good. This is certainly a good spot for a date or food and drinks with friends. The service is great the waitress was very attentive"
"Four stars because the bagels are fresh and absolutely delicious with just the right amount of cream cheese. On top of that the workers are quick and attentive, you can get in and out quickly. The only reason this isn't a five star is because their iced coffee is terrible. Do yourself a favor and get coffee elsewhere but other than that? Bagels are definitely their thing! Yum..So it 630am monday morning. I wanted to start my day off right and try this bagel spot. Upon walking in, the woman by the window, (register) is setting up. No hello, no good morning. Its as if I were a ghost. Then I see some guys behind the counter continue talking. I stand and look around wondering if im suppose to be here at this time. It almost looked as if theyre not ready for business. So i asked, ""Hello, are you guys open?"" The guy stops his conversation and says, ""yeah were open. Why you think were not?"" I said, ""Well.....no one said anything. So i didnt know--nevermind. May I have a plain bagel etc etc"" He takes the order. 10 seconds after i said that, 2 italian (cause of their heavy long island accents) construction workers walk in and all you hear from the workers, ""HI GOOD MORNING!Great. Have to start my day dealing with racists buttholes making bagels. ALL WERE LATINOS, must be said. Rude Woman behind counter just handed my money,  Not only they did that...but got my order wrong. Gave me a cinnamon rasin bagel (when im allergic to rasins) instead of a plain bagel. Of course i realized this after leaving and too late to return. Instead of making a fuss....ill wrote this review.AVOID THIS PLACE AND RUDE NON LISTENING, RACIST STAFF.Daily Bagel is overdue for my review. I've been there a couple of times. I find it pricey but worth it. The bagels are plump and made on premises. When I first visited I felt out of place at Daily Bagel. There's a lot of regulars. They allow inside seating with proof of vaccination. There's seating outside too. Today's visit was to get bagels to freeze for winter. The prices are steep per bagel at $1.65. You have to visit early because they run out of some varieties. They were out of pumpernickel today so I bought a Whole Wheat Everything. They're really good and plump but not too doughy. I'm not sure why the reviews are so bad. I'd definitely return for breakfast. It's professional in the food handling. They keep the bagels covered in plastic wrap rather than out in the open. I was impressed. I like the window counter seating by the front door. I'm sure I'll be back..I've never had a happy experience here, and that's why there's always a line out the door at Bagelworks down the street! Also, during covid, masks appear to be utilized only as chin protectors here....As someone who loves everything bagels for their ""everything,"" I was pretty disappointed by the toppings on my bagel. The toppings were extremely sparse, to the point where my bagel looked more plain than anything else. The bagel had kind of a rough chewy texture. If someone told me that the bagel was a day old I would believe them.The cream cheese was evenly spread on the bagel, but I wish that it could have been thicker. This was my first time having veggie cream cheese that had so much carrot. Not a bad thing, but not what I was expecting!The bagel was quite dense so it made for a solid meal. After seeing the other reviews here I was relieved that the bagel didn't give me indigestion.Would I come back? Probably not. But if you're not too picky and looking for a decently sized bagel for its price, then maybe consider checking this place out..So happy they have dairy free vegan cream cheese!!! The scallion and veggie option are both very good!.Anything you can do to avoid this place is worth it. Rude staff, dirty, overpriced and unkept..Great spot for lunch or breakfast. Plenty of seats and it moves pretty quick. The price is dead on as well. Everyday they have a different special. Staff if friendly and the place is clean. Tons of options from full breakfast to small yogurts. I'll be back for sure..It was after 11, bit they honored the price for eggs on an everything bagel sandwich. The eggs and bagel were fresh. Friendly prompt service and covered outdoor seating on this rainy day..This place has RAT'S!!! Went to use their restroom and the rodent ran across my feet.   wtf"
"I ordered delivery through Yelp. The order was scheduled for a specific time, and they were very precise with their timing: the food arrived 2 minutes before the scheduled time. They were not precise with the food though: they gave me a bunch of food I didn't order. I got a busy tone when I called. I think it ended up being alright because some of the food was fairly similar to what I ordered, and there was a lot more of it. The food was nice. The kabobs were cooked well. I don't have a lot to say about the rest of the food because I didn't get to the rest until a while later, on account of there being more food than I ordered, and therefore it was somewhat stale by then. It does look like the chicken shawarma platter has a lot more meat than the kabob platters though--maybe twice as much. The kabob platter had somewhat less food than a typical meal, while the shawarma was a normal portion. Of course, when a restaurant gets an order wrong, the outcome is often different..My brother and I came here because my brother had ordered a meal on Too Good to Go. They didn't seem pleased that he had redeemed it, which is odd because the establishment can choose whether or not they want to use the app and can limit how many can redeem.I did not have a slot so I ordered a falafel platter. It came with a lot of food but was a steep price for a mostly take out restaurant. I was given 6 falafel balls, and a choice of sides. I chose eggplant, Israeli salad, rice, and another vegetable. The food was very good..I think the platters here are grossly overpriced for what it is. They do give a good amount of meat but for $25, I expected fireworks. There was no point in getting the mixed platter because it all tasted like chicken anyway. The hummus tasted fresh but the pickled veggies were sad (not very pickled/not sour) and the limp fries were sad along with it. However, the green sauce was extremely good, thick and heavy with garlic but they only gave one, and the one container is the half-size of a normal container.The only saving grace were the falafels that tasted fresh and were fairly priced, but the very runny tahini sauce was a disappointment. I will definitely go back if I'm passing by and pick up some falafel's but that's about it..Went here with my sister. We got a beef shwarma and falafel platter both were very good. The falafel was definitely very fresh and the shwarma was well seasoned. The Israeli salad could use better seasoning but everything else was perfect. They even have Israeli staff making the food, give this place a try..Underwhelmed. I love Middle Eastern food, and with all the positive reviews, I thought this would be a surefire home run. You pay ~$22 for what's essentially just street cart shawarma. Now, that's not an insult - I LOVE me a good shawarma cart, especially for a late-night craving. But honestly, there are more than a few shawarma carts that would blow this place out of the water, flavor-wise, and at a fraction of the cost.The main plus is that portion size is decent. The food itself wasn't particularly flavorful. I got a chicken shawarma with rice, beans, and some mixed salads on the side. The beans were strangely vinegary. My salad side included a scoop of their eggplant-tomato dip, which had an unpleasant, overly sweet aftertaste. On the service side, I'd agree with a few reviewers that they were a bit rude. Just a general unfriendly vibe. They also told me with utmost certainty that my credit cards AND debit carts were being declined, even tho I explained that I had just used them minutes before arriving. It was only after I showed them the available balance on my debit card mobile app that they changed their tone and realized there was a problem with their machine, not my cards. This was so overpriced and not at all worth it, unfortunately..And garbage don't waste your money they charge you $25 only for one Shawarma with no salad are you kidding me there's so many better places like yours garbage garbage and garbage garbage again.Came to Tov-Li Shawarma, I love it so much. I can't even begin to explain how ecstatic Tov-Li Shawarma makes me. Such a fabulous menu, it was quite hard to choose, but I am really happy that I bought Chicken Shawarma Platter. Bonus that their service is so really good, they are so swift and welcoming. I can't rave any more about Tov-Li Shawarma..Hankering for falafel we googled and found Tov-Li. We ordered pick up. They were fast, courteous, and called us to return when they forgot some of our order. Oh my goodness this food was delicious and the portions huge. We had the Chicken Kebab sandwich, the marinated grilled baby chicken platter, the lamb chicken turkey sandwhich, falafel with tahini, Moroccan carrots, the eggplant tomato salad, red cabbage/Cole slaw, and a cabbage salad with turmeric and chili. I'm not sure if we're supposed to eat the sandwiches this way, but we added the Cole slaw salad and the eggplant tomato to them and it was delectable. To note, this is Central Asian, Bukharian Jewish cuisine (if you're looking for Mediterranean/Middle Eastern style falafel, this isn't it) with the fluffiest pitas we've ever had. It was our family's first time eating this cuisine and we can't wait to try more! They threw in an extra pita with our order. Thank you Tov-Li!.B'H' this spot came to 108th!Finally a fresh, kosher, Israeli restaurant in the neighborhood! Delicious, affordable, authentic Middle Eastern cuisine. Sit down area, bathroom, hand washing area, and plenty of Hebrew speakers available!.Nice shawarma, not the typical authentic middle eastern but still pretty tasty and not too oily or greasy. I liked the shawarma platter, I just think it's overpriced, for a shawarma platter to be 25-26$ + tax + 2$ service, I expect a little more quality and quantity. I ordered 2 shawarma platter and paid 59$. Overall, I would still recommend trying it out."
"Great restaurant with delicious food and amazing service. Reasonably priced, easy to find parking, low noise environment. Ideal for groups or a date..A friend of mine lives in the neighborhood and while visiting suggested we eat at Grill 108.  It was like stepping into my Eastern European grandmothers kitchen.  There was a lot too choose from and I was tempted to try everything on the menu but I finally decided on the Israel salad, the borsht, the chebureck, and the rice pilov.  Yes I over ate but totally worth it - WOW - what a treat.  The food is authentic and delicious, it also happens to be kosher yet very reasonably priced.  I loved it...waiting for a Manhattan location..Food not tasty cooks don't speak the language when I was asking for something specific .. owner has no knowledge of how to run a business . I finally got the good the food was way too salty the service was bad the staff too slow it's obvious this place has been in business for not so long but I live by forest hills I followed the Yelp reviews it's obvious he is telling his friends to post good reviews I paid and I left . Eat at your own risk highly NOT recommend this restaurant not even for free.Food not tasty cooks don't speak the language when I was asking for something specific .. owner has no knowledge of how to run a business .

Eat at your own risk highly NOT recommend this restaurant not even for free.This joint deserves less than a zero star!  The food is atrocious.  I had the Hungarian goulash with french fries.  The meat was the cheapest cut possible: fatty, tough, and inedible.  The french fries were soggy and tasteless.  My mother had the lamb shish-ke-bab with mashed potatoes.  Once again the meat was of the lowest grade possible and awful.  The mashed potatoes were just a watery mess.  Don't believe any of the good reviews they must have been written by their friends and relatives. Avoid this place at all costs!.Great Bukharan kebab place on 108th St. They have good skewers and patyr or non (round tandoori bread). The baba ghanoush is a tiny bit sour for my taste. But still, overall very good food..Excellent new Bukharian place. Great addition to neighborhood. We enjoyed excellent Sherpa soup, Ukrainian borscht, fresh salad, non tekee flat bread, vegetable kebab, lamb kebabs, fat free lamb kebab, roasted carp. A keeper..Great food and fresh salads. The bread was from the oven and on point. Service was excellent!.Love the veal lamb and liver here. Even taking out the lamb is cooked perfect!!! All the other good is great but those two are my favorite.This place has amazing food. They are reasonably priced and you can't go wrong with anything that you order. Such a great asset to the neighborhood!.Was visiting a friend in the neighborhood and decided to try some Uzbek food. He recommended to stop by this place and I'm happy that I did! Restaurant is cozy and gives you a good impression with its friendliness and authenticity. After trying their soup - Lagman I felt like my taste buds melted. Hands down the best Lagman and Samsa I've had in New York."
"Actually pretty good, especially the fried rice. One of the softest fried rices I've had in a while - not dry at all, and pretty flavorful. Still not as good as my go to on Avenue U, but it was definitely a good decision. Chicken and broccoli - Classic. They do it well here tooChicken wings were too deep fried for my liking tho, and just tad bit on the dry side.Nice people, good quality food and preparation.  Fun choice in the neighborhood.  Try it..No silverware with my order spent $40 and couldn't give me napkins or forks or anything. My pregnant wife felt so disgusted with the service from here.I became very sick after eating chicken soup at this place. I had the worst food poisoning in my life.I had really bad diarrhea and vomiting for almost 3 days. This place should be inspected by a Food Inspector  because obviously they don't get rid of their stale food.I believe this place should be shut down..Opened around December 2015Cantonese / Hunan / Szechuan Chinese Take outOn their menu, they use 100% vegetable oil and they don't use MSG (a plus for me).I have ordered the beef chow fun from this place several times and I like it. It doesn't have the wow factor from a Cantonese restaurant but it's doable. It's not salty, just the right amount of seasoning..One of the better takeout chinese restaurants.  They usually get our orders correct, and the food is very good. Only complaint is when I ask for broccoli well done, it is still a bit hard..So cheap! We're regular customers and these people still try to rip us off! Barely any chicken,they give us too many broccoli sticks that you can't eat. Extremely disappointed! Do not recommend!!!.Good amount of food for the price. I ordered a small lo mein, small wonton soup, and dumplings for under $15 - it was so much food that my son and I couldn't get close to finishing it. For take out Chinese food, the quality/taste was good..Really bad service.I ordered my lunch around 12:10pm, my colleagues came around 10 to 15 minutes after I already ordered and another guy came in and ordered chicken with black bean sauce a bit after me, he received his order before me, while I had to wait an extra 5 minutes after him. It took about 35 minutes for me to get a lunch order of chicken with cashew nuts while they were pumping out delivery orders. That's not good or smart and left me with barely 5 minutes to eat my lunch.....One of the best chinese foods Ive eaten! They delivered great chinese food without an extreme wait! I got general tsos chicken, pork and friend rice and lo mein!"
"Three words: VEGAN CEASAR SALADThree more words: CARLA IS AMAZINGHands down one of my favorite places to eat and drink - the cocktails and staff are amazing - everyone is so attentive from the second you walk in until the second you leave. It has a very old school, laidback vibe. There's no pressure in this place to meet the standard Manhattan bar vibe - you come, you eat, you play, you go home andddddd then you want to go back the next day. (Much. Like. I. Did)..Cool little hipster taco spot near chinatown and little italy. This is a hole in the wall type place and packs a punch. I came for lunch with a coworker. Knowing that the taco's were the specialty I had to try it. I went with the sweet potato taco and the fish taco. The sweet potato taco was pretty good. If you didnt look you would think you are eating meat. The fish taco was also good but not the best fish taco I have had. The one negative is that the slaw was very runny that came on the taco. It is a red slaw so if that juice ends up on your shirt it is pretty much ruined. Luckily that didnt happen but be careful.Overall, I liked the spot and the food had good flavor. This wouldn't be my first suggestion for tacos but if I am in the area I would stop in..I didn't want to leave a review for Lalito until I'd been several times and had the opportunity to sample a variety of items from both the cocktail and dinner menus. Having visited three separate times within the last six months, I feel as if I've had the opportunity to properly assess their seasonal specials, as well as the a la carte options. That being said, I intend to return a million more times because I am completely in love with everything this place has to offer.Not only is the establishment a hidden gem (maybe not so much anymore as there's a well deserved new article about them on various food blogs), but the staff are all complete treasures as well. My two faves are Carla and Zach for different, yet very similar reasons. While everyone at Lalito is always warm and welcoming, my experience with these two is what will keep me coming back.I stopped drinking a few years ago, but sat at the bar on my first visit with one of my friends who ordered a drink. Zach kindly asked what I would like - to which I annoyingly answered, ""Umm well I don't drink but are you able to make me something that feels like I am?"" I'm sure that has to be one of the the worst requests a bartender could receive but he was elated to create something for me. The end result was absolutely delicious and since then, I only request drinks from Zach when I visit.I understand first impressions are important, and there will always be a 'one off' experience at any restaurant you visit, but take the negative reviews with a grain of salt and please don't let any of them prevent you from experiencing Lalito for yourself. I can almost guarantee you'll be as in love with it as I am..This place opened in lieu of the former establishment, Winnie's - a former community gem and dive bar with karaoke. After walking past this place for however long, I decided to grab brunch at Lalito's this past Sunday. Upon walking in, you're greeted by friendly staff. The place wasn't too packed so you can essentially chose where you want to sit. Great natural lighting by the way. When my friend finally arrived, we ordered our coffees and brunch entrees. My friend ordered the Plato Tipico with a side of ""thick cut bacon"" and I ordered the Coconut Grits with braised pork. We had originally requested the Smoked Sable but they were out! Our side of thick cut bacon came first, cut into 4 pieces, drizzled with maple syrup. Sweet and savory. Next came the Plato Tipico...and as my friend described it, it was quite typical in taste, nothing stood out to him. I personally was looking forward to the coconut grits. It was just something I've never had together. After tasting the first bite, the coconut grits reminded me of sticky mango rice dessert but more gooey. The sauce surrounding it like a body of water to a moat was saltier than I would've preferred. The braised pork was nice and tender but again, too salty. I had to continue drinking water and coffee to wash out the salt. Sadly I couldn't finish it because of the abundance in seasoning. Alas, as were heading out, I went to use the bathroom. There are two and the one I entered felt like I entered into a bathroom garden. Nicely done. I'd come back because it is a pleasant place with pleasant staff but I was not a fan of my meal, especially at ~$16/entree and $6 sides. I'd like to see this place thrive but I'm having trouble picturing it, as it is an oddity placed in Chinatown. The customers definitely does not reflect the community. Perhaps change up the menu to include small delectable plates at a smaller cost, or continue to grind it out and see what unfolds..How the heck does this place have 4 stars?  My friends and I picked this place based on the glowing reviews and everything was a disaster, from start to finish.  The service was friendly, but slow.  And when I say slow, I mean sloooooow.  We had to ask for things multiple times.  Our drinks sat by the bar for what seemed like ages.  There was only one server and the brunch rush was a bit busy, but not that busy.  We received a lot of apologies from the server.  She honestly was doing the best she could given she was the only one working.  But it was too the point where we almost went to the bar to get our drinks and to get more hot sauce.Food was delivered so inconsistently.  Two people received a dish then 10 min later mine came then 20 min later my other friend's came.  So much for dining together.   They did us right and comped her meal.But I'd say the worst part of the meal was they were out of 50% of the dishes on the menu.  In the literally sense of the word.  When we finally settled on one of the dishes, the waitress said they were out of one of the main ingredients (haloumi cheese), but they could make the dish without it.   On top of all this, it's completely overpriced.  $15 for 2 eggs, toast and bacon and a few sad potatoes.  Makes my heart sad.  Not sure what's going on at this establishment, but at this rate, they will be closed soon..Pricey and Mediocre that shines bright in an area with no other options.- Lalito's epitaph when it's eventually re-branded. I'm disappointed by this place monthly. No seriously, I mean it. I keep coming back and I don't know why.Except I do, they have Brooklyn Gin and I like the decor.Other than that, this place is a joke. It's pricey for seemly no reason. The food portions are small -- which could be a blessing because everything we've ordered hasn't been good. My friend got the pork tacos and couldn't even finish them. It was embarrassing. When the bartender removed his full dish he asked, ""Oh. You didn't like them?""It was crazy condescending and irritating.   For such a cute place, it's truly a shame it's a joke..I came here for dinner with my aunt and had a great experience! The place is small but it didn't feel over crowded. Lalito puts an interesting spin on the Tex-Mex cuisine so there were many things on the menu that I had never tried before. The food was delicious. One of my favorites was the chickpea guacamole. All of the plates are perfect for sharing so you can get many different things. I enjoyed the cocktails a lot as well! I do think you should get a little bit more food for what you pay for since things were on the pricier side. The ambiance was really cute inside! It was a mix of fun and laid back at the same time. Staff is friendly but a little slow but if you are looking to hangout and catch up with friends while you wait for your food then Lalito is perfect!.This place is a hidden gem!  The space is charming and even more if you realize this used to be a karaoke bar!  It has been completely transformed and the food will make you sing for more!We came for brunch and ordered family style.  Coconut grits with pork- omg!!  This is amazing!!!Granola with yogurt and yams- sounds weird but was tasty.Breakfast Taco- with eggs (the first choice). Very good.Bacon bin salad-  I ate this as a lettuce wrap.  Very good.Plato tipio - very goodThis place is great.  The service has room to improve as we had to flag the waiter down a few times but I would return!.Was craving tacos so checked out yelp and this was a suggested spot.  The space is nice and clean, looks sort of between a diner and a café taking you back in time a few decades.The bar area is different as it was filled with a great selection of spirits, some of which I've never heard of.  They also have crystals placed around the bar area which gives it a zen feel. While I waited on my take-out order, the bartender/waiter brought me ice water, was nice since it was a warm day out.  I scanned the space and was able to see the cooks/chefs preparing my meal.  I'd definitely go back during dinner and check out their happy hour vibe.The two soft tacos were nicely filled with a good amount of fish,  red cabbage sour kraut, onions, radish, etc. and it was very tasty, that I was surprised it did not require additional condiments or hot sauce.If in the neighborhood and craving Mexican food, give them a try..This is a review of the even by Tasting Collective that we attended. It was a 10- course Nouveau Mexican Feast.  It opened up about six months ago in Chinatown. We were curious to try a traditional Mexican cuisine with a modern twist at this restaurant.  The interior was modern an simple, not large but not too small. They have fully stocked bar with counter seating as well. At the beginning of the event, chef/co-owner Geraldo Gonzalez came out to greet us and gave us a quick background about him and his restaurant. He offers traditional dishes he grew up with, like his mother's cooking, with his own twist at this restaurant. Also, we learned that he does not serve avocado (in any style) here... He is somehow against it, which is kind of funny...We got to try Local Oyster Shot, Baby Corn Esquites, Boquerones Tostada, Fluke Ceviche, Lalito Carnitas, Marinated Beets, Melon Salad, Mexican, Mixed Zucchini, and Plantain Cream Pie.The portion size for family-style plates were a bit small. Which made it difficult to get the full flavor of some items. I see on the other people's reviews that the small portion size is a common thing here. Overall, the food was good, but nothing really stood out in any special way. It still was a good experience to try out some dishes from new, upcoming restaurant that seems to be getting lots of attention."
"I've been a customer at this Wendy's location for many many years however due to the fact that I am now more active on yelp I will be updating on many of the locations I visit normally. So this morning I decided I wanted to have breakfast couldn't make up my mind but I know I wanted to have my morning iced coffee. Wendy's has a new menu and some great options on there so I decided to visit this morning.I went with the number eight Breakfast combo with no sausage. So it's a egg and cheese on a bun the egg as you would expect taste like a microwaved egg but it's really cheesy. A large seasoned potatoes which had a great crunch and taste. For my drink I got a large iced vanilla frosty-ccino now this thing is huge and packed with a lot of ice so now I know next time I would be asking for light ice. When it comes to taste I would say you do taste of vanilla flavor but the aftertaste I'm not sure if I really liked it. One thing is for sure after a little while I'm sure the flavor will change due to all the ice. It was so packed with ice when I got home I decided to empty out most of it as seen in the photos. I also got a honey butter biscuit that was drenched in butter, it has a very rich taste. Customer service: I placed my order didn't know what I wanted but she was patient until I was ready I didn't feel rushed. When I got to the window I asked for ketchup she told me she they were still working on my fries and if I could pull over to the side. I waited maybe for 2-3 minutes and my food was brought to me. I noticed I didn't have my receipt and asked the young lady that brought me my food if I could get a copy and she was very pleasant about getting it for me. Thank you to her.I don't know if this is the WORST Wendy's in existence but it's far from the best. The food is as you would typically expect at any Wendy's but I'm really giving it 2 stars due to a safety concern. There are crackheads that knock on your car window as you approach the drive thru begging for money. They need to hire at least sporadic security to clean up the loitering in the parking lot and create a safer environment..Went threw drive thru...young lady taking order needs to be nicer...the young lady who took my payment was lovely.  They screwed up my order, instead of regular nuggets they gave me spicy...my nephew was not happy.  Burger tasted as if it was sitting for a while.  Frosty was ok..Terrible and slow costumer service. I walked in with my family and the woman who took our order gave my mom a really rude attitude, and she also gave my family and me a pretty bad stare. I'd never come back die to costumer service alone. Thanks to Janice for her horrible service and attitude.Wait was perhaps 20 minutes at the drive thru. Got my food with no fries and didn't notice until I was back on the highway. Clearly understaffed..I always order from Wendy's on doordash, I've been to the actual location only twice. Each time I was there, they were rude and never got my order right. Even when ordering it delivery they always forget to give me half of my order..Ordered maple bacon chicken croissants for breakfast and was really disappointed. Bacon was old, burnt and chicken was not fresh. I don't understand what type of standard these people has but I know if they were served the food I had they wouldn't eat it. The manager should inspect the quality of the food before serving it..Staff are friendly and attentive. Food was fresh and their 2 for $5 deals are great. Atmosphere not so good. They used to have a guard to make sure the school kids don't hang out but that's not the case anymore..Let me start by saying if I could give 0 stars I would . Since the epidemic started I feel like they give you coldFood on purpose . I order food I don't touch the food until I fully sanitize my hands at home , I went to get food from here twice by time I got home the FOOD was ICE COLD . I live literally 5 mins from Wendy's there is no way my food should be freezing cold . I am so disappointed in Wendy's ..As we were driving along Hillside Avenue of Upper Jamaica Queens on a late night, visibly only few were still in business operation.  We were starving and we were looking for the right fast food place  for our needs. As Wendy is known being open late and it was on our way, we made a turn to this location as soon we passed by. I  heard so much good things  about the updated and fresh Wendy menu idea so I want to confirm it myself. As we walk in, we could tell the staff is getting ready for closing . We still have hour to enjoy though our meal. We settled for salad #1-the spicy grilled chicken Caesar salad and #3-the Apple walnut salad. Both were satisfying. We got the freshness we were expecting.  Each respective dressing were perfectly selected by the Wendy's chef , thumbs up fir that.,Pricing for half serving is reasonable. The restaurant has a modern  look outside and inside. It has a fireplace  in a lounge area, a big screen TV for patron  use, a stylish soda dispenser, high bar tables , comfy low tables with matching cushy chairs. May they  keep this place well..Went here for a late night snack with my hubby. He was super excited about getting the baconator and I got the S'wesome bacon burger. Unfortunately, when we got home from the drive thru we discovered that my husband had got a triple burger. He was super bummed because what he wanted was the bacon. We were too annoyed to go all the way back there for the burger. We just know that if we ever go here to verify that we got exactly what we want before we drive away."
"Nice vibes! Strong drinks & delicious food. I recommend the curry goat or the escovietch fish..During the week days they try to pass off small jerk chickens as larges. They are literally ripping off customers. If you don't have enough chicken for a large, only offer small and mediums during the week. Do not have a customer pay the large price only to receive what would be a small on the weekend. That is so dishonest and unprofessional..Jamaican cuisine, Bar Lounge all in one placeFood is excellent. My favorite dish is the Steam red Snapper with okra, carrots and Jamaican water crackers.  Oxtail,  curry goat's and jerk chicken are my next dishes. Mature events during the week and weekend.  Great music..This was the first time, I visited this location its not boring because the music is definitely a go but at the same time it's not very wowwing, if you know what I mean. For example, I could tell when my group & I walked in on a Saturday night and wanted to sit at a table and not a bar, the way they reacted was like ""Okay okay sit anywhere you want"" and immediately the guy (probably in charge) went to call someone out from the back to cater to us. The waiter service isn't needed because as you see in the back people literally walk up to a back window to order to-go food. The food was exceptional, that I cannot lie and if anything I will come back solely on that behalf. When we wanted to order, there was no menu, but out of courtesy our waitress said what was usually sold and put it in with the cook in the kitchen. Another thing, was it is very dark like some of the other reviews mention. However, that may be a good thing because me being who I am the aesthetics of the place isn't there... from the flooring to the lighting designs in the place. Not there at all. It's a very chill environment it served its purpose very well. I do plan on coming back when I'm looking a little getaway or drink to calm weekend vibes with friends or conversation..Usually, I am quiet satisfied with my food from this place but tonight has left me very angry to the point of disgust. I was ordering to go for a large group of friends to I troduce them to the restaurant, because I really like the chicken and portions. I went to Island grill to order 4 large servings of jerk chicken (without rice and peas), but had to argue with the kitchen crew to even give sauce with the food. I normally come in and get 1 or 2 servings of jerk chicken, always without rice and peas, so I know what the size should be. I literally had to stop them to ask if they were serving a large meal or small meal, because either they're saving the food to take home or something else. The guy serving realized that I knew what he was doing and put a bit more in the last order. The rest were half-full containers. Why am I being cheated as a customer because I am ordering more food and giving more money? It really makes me want to take my business elsewhere. This place does not seem to appreciate good customers. I am very displeased with the service and attitude of the kitchen crew.. And really thinking of not going back to this place and definitely never ordering multiple meals for a large group again..I prefer to give this place 3.5*'s. This is your local bar hangout. It reminds me of the bars in Jamaica that have a little dance going on and people buying food on the side. It is comprised mainly of a Jamaican population and is very chill and laid back. The music is always good especially if you like that caribbean feel. They have Fish Fry Wednesday and I must say the fish is really good. It's made escovitch style. I have also had the pepper shrimp that is so good if they have them. The cowfoot soup is  really good, hearty, filling and spicy. The jerk wings are flavored well but would be so much better if they weren't fried. I haven't tried anything else but the food smells good and people are always ordering. They also have a tv behind the bar rhey usually keep on a sports channel. The rum punch is just the way I like it made with Mr. Wray and Nephew. If your looking for a bar to relax, let loose and be yourself with great music and a nice vibe. This is your place..Horrible experience... Order Rice and peas with stew chicken once I took it home the rice was ok, but the chicken was not cooked...It's a small bar and grill but it's very chill. A nice spot to go to and enjoy a drink after work, watch a game, or meet up with friends. The food is delicious!! Particularly love the jerk chicken!!"
"Great cheap foodJERK OVER RICE - $6 Delicious tender chicken, sauces can get a little cloying, but ask for less. Rice n beans were good!Can't beat affordable great food that comes out fast!.Ordered small  carry chicken with rice&peas, salad and Mac &chese . No promiced  salad, no carry gravy were added. Rice was super dry. Chicken curry was mostly  presented with collection of pieces of chicken bones from chicken spine and knee joint with small pieces of meat.  Mac&cheese - kind of bland macaroni with  addition of cheddar. 3 stars - it is eadable. Would I order again - probably not.I got pick up from this place through door dash. I pass it almost everyday but never tried it but the most recent reviews raved. They never let door dash know my order was ready so I just went over after a while and it was ready. I ordered the jerk chicken plate with rice and peas and Mac and cheese. I asked for jerk sauce on top but didn't get it and boy was it needed. The rice and peas was very dry which I've never experienced. Almost like it was probably sitting in the heat lamp/tray for a while after being cooked. All of the chicken was very dry/over done and the Mac and cheese was literally just salty pasta with a layer of cheese on top. I'm only giving 3 stars because of the amount of food and it was generally edible but I much prefer peppas and won't be returning here..UPDATE: This review is for their Newkirk Plaza restaurant. I picked up medium jerk chicken today. I asked the guy who was chopping up the chicken if it was from today and told him that in the past I've gotten dried up jerk chicken, I could not eat it. He was visibly annoyed at my question and shouted at me, ""OF COURSE!!"", then did not give me the last piece he cut, instead he scraped that piece off of the board into the trash. I just sat down to eat, and here goes again, could not eat it. Jerk chicken is dry, hard, and feels like a piece of hard plastic, peas and rice is dry and hard. I happily support local businesses always,  especially during COVID pandemic but I will not be supporting this place any longer and hope you don't either because you will regret it too. I gave it one star for nasty attitudes of servers/cashiers, unprofessional and uncourteous customer service, and extremely low quality of food..I might be addicted to this place for the rice and peas. I feel like they playing with my emotions when they be out of cabbage though...the jerk chicken is the bomb.com...skip the fish. Also, don't come in here expecting anybody to ki$$ your ass. They stay busy all damn day erryday. And if you get there too late, that's why they ran out of something. I remember early in pandemic, folks was coming in there disrespectful (not wearing masks, not counting and coming in when there's too many people). Now they have a better system and you order and wait outside for your food. The way it should be right now. Support Black owned business..Oxtail stewed so long most have fallen off the bone and meat softened as one with the thick beany sauce over luscious coconut rice and peas. Cabbage also stewed into a long, soft and sweetened mess. Their jerk chicken is a stand-out. Possibly the best- crusty charred and grilled with subtle flavor hints of jerk spices, FC's jerk is unlike other heavily sauced versions. It's no wonder they sell their J chicken like hot cakes. With sides of subtle sauces to flavor the slightly drier version, but oh-so-Smokey and crisp! So different and worthy..The food is ok but the Cashier and the girl in the back are disgusting. They have stank attitudes for no reason and make you not want to come back. It may be ok for some but customer service is important to me. If you don't like your job go somewhere else. I had just came from getting my wisdom tooth pulled and needed something soft to eat. The owner should get rid of those girls and get ppl that actually want to be there..Jerk chicken is the best I've tasted in this area. Service is mediocre. But I still love it..I live in the area so I have eaten at this restaurant many times off and on when no other restaurants are available to me. Each time I am disappointed. Tonight I ordered the Escovitch fish , I was once again very disappointed the fish tasted like it had sat open in the freezer for awhile and just thrown in the fryer. The steam vegetables were soggy and tasteless. Overall I have given up on this restaurant ..My first and second visit was so-so. My third visit....Small portion of meat for a medium sized oxtail dinner, sticky white rice and hard plantains. Today was my LAST visit!The Fisherman's Cove on Parkside between Ocean & Flatbush the best!!A bit far from me, but worth the drive. They always get it right! So delicious!"
"Today for dinner I had:- pepperoni cremini pizza - arugula saladOrdered by the pizza counter and eaten at the bar with a pint of the Brooklyn lager.Food was served within a minute! I did not even had a chance to check my emails when it appeared in front of me. Really enjoyed it..Love, love, loved the pizza. So thin, crusty and yeasty all at the same time. HEAVEN in a slice I say! Out of the three pizzas that we ordered, we liked the Margherita with Shiitake & Garlic best. The other two, Margherita With Crimini And Pepperoni and the deconstructed Pesto special that night were also quite yummy.Three pizza's might have been a little too much for the three of us, but the slices disappeared. And quickly I might add..We stumbled upon this place and we loved it. The ambience was great, the servers are friendly and the pizza was delicious. It's basically a cozy bar with the added benefit of having pizza available.Not sure what's not to love about it. If you're expecting a sit down- this isn't the type of place you want to come to. If, however, you want to catch up with friends or enjoy a nice beer or glass of wine AND eat a pizza on a shared couch- then, by all means, this is your place..DO go here if:You're looking for a unique pizzaYou like a chewy. tangy pizza crustYou love Neapolitan-style pizza, decorated with leopard spots You like Mr. Wizard-esque kitchen set-upsYou've already eaten & just want a snackYou get foodie boners hearing about obscure ingredientsYou've already tried Roberta's & you're hungry for moreDO NOT go here if:You gripe about prohibitively-priced, comparatively small pizzasYou are with a large groupYou like sitting comfortably at real tablesYou want take-outYou want to drink something more high-end than Yuengling or Stoli RazzYou're ravenousMixed bag review?  I loved the pizzas (i had to eat two to fill up) but i hated everything about the restaurant experience.  Food ranks higher with me, so the 4 stars is for the pizza.  I think every pizza lover should try this place at least once & decide for themselves whether they'll be running back to Wild Rise..I went back tonight and tried the pepperoni mushroom pizza.  With my husband waiting at the bar to pay for our pizzas, I got to observe a lot more about the pizza making process I did not catch the first time around and learned a few new things from the owner. This pizza concept was 4 years in the making and the thoughtfulness, research and care that goes into the pizza really shines through. The attention to detail from the logo, to the packaging to the ingredients and assembly is obvious if you pay attention. First, look at the oven - the temperature is electronically controlled and is kept at 1,000 degrees. They have a laser gun that I think also measures the temperature. The pizza cooks in literally one minute. It's like a magic show and great feat of culinary technology. Second, look at the ingredients organized in the bins. Apparently the dough is allowed to rise for 2 days. They use bufala mozzarella imported from Italy. The basil looked like someone sorted through several bushels to pick leaves of the same color and size. The 17""pepperoni + crimini pizza was $21. The other pizza with toppings option is shitake + garlic for the same price, which I have not tried yet. The pepperoni crimini was delicious pizza heaven in your mouth. There's not much else to say about how it tastes. I love the pepperoni - it's not too oily and curls up to a thicker, smaller disc when cooked. The flavor and smokiness is subtle enough that you can taste the other components of the pizza. After my second wild rise pie, i can decidedly say that my overall favorite thing about this pizza is the texture of the dough. I've had great mozzarella, basil and san marzano tomato sauce before, but the dough is truly unlike anything else I've tasted before. Neopolitan is now my new favorite style..This is a new pizza place that takes up some space in a bar at 68 jay street and is open currently only on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday evenings. They make neopolitan style pizza, which is thin and the dough, which is made with wild yeast, is chewy and light. There's almost a slight sourdough taste which is yummy. The pizza bakes really quickly. They offer two sizes of pizza, 10"" and 17"". The larger one was not that big, finished it no problem...and cost $17. The pizza which I got to go came in a beautiful cotton bag. This pizza was good but seems quite pricey, given that grimaldis charges the same amount for a much bigger pie. Nevertheless, I really like the pizza and hope it sticks around..Jess T's review nails this place down accurately. If you're looking for a sit down, reasonably priced pizza place to fill you up, this is not it. If you want to splurge on a piece of pizza art, or want a little snack after your real dinner (while having some drinks) this is your place.It's an amazing pizza. The dough is a game changer, light, spongy, and delicious. I got the crimini and pepperoni which I enjoyed. The pepperoni took over the show in a good way, with the crimini basically showing up way in the background.The margherita hits just the right notes of tomato, cheese, and basil all playing in unison. Also, the staff are really friendly. When ordering, I was asked if I wanted it to go, so I'm guessing they do take out now.5 Stars if either you got more pizza, or the pizza was cheaper..Walking around the DUMBO Arts Fest, I noticed a little lady giving out free samples of their pizza. Naturally, I had to try it and damn, it was delicious! They keep the yeast 'live' so you can really taste the difference in the dough. I'll be back to eat in and have a whole pizza. To myself..While at the Dumbo Arts Festival in Brooklyn NY, I came across free samples of Neopolitan Pizza.  From the the very first morsel I was awestruck.  I immediately tasted the richness of the sauce, the freshness of the basil.  The taste of the pizza compelled me to step inside the shop and witness how it all goes down.   The custom-made oven is electronically controlled and maintained at 900 degrees.  The dough is solely comprised of flour, salt, water and wild yeast and takes roughly 2 days to rise.  The sauce San Marzano Tomatoes.  The cheese Bufala Mozzarella from Campania.  Really nice spot and excellent service.  You must check this place out.WildRise. 68 Jay Street. Dumbo, Brooklyn. Only oped Sunday, Monday and Tuesday evenings..This place is kind of amazing.I only came here in the afternoon and tried the margherita pizza. the space was nice, seemed like a cool place to come and have a beer with an amazing pizza, so I'll probably do that next time.but there were 3 components that really made this a 5 star experience:1) the method: the custom oven they use that cooks the pizza in under a minute is way cool (complete with a temperature gun), and the scientific approach behind the whole thing makes it unique2) the staff was very knowledgable and genuinely excited about the distinctiveness/backstory of the ingredients3) the pizza (obviously). the flavors are complex and amazing. you can really taste the difference in the crust, and the tang of the san marzano tomatoes... it all makes the whole thing delicious in a 'sophisticated palate' kind of waywill definitely be coming back to try out some of the toppings..Wow!! Best pizza EVER.  The crust is incredible, chewy and tangy, apparently fermented with wild yeast. It's like a subtle sourdough flavor. I loved it.  We tried the Margherita, and beyond the dough, the toppings are fantastic too. Perfect amount of crushed tomatoes, basil and fresh mozzarella.  Simple and delicious. Slightly pricey."
"Jay St Bar is your standard(in a good way) local bar that had good drinks for a reasonable price and laid back atmosphere. My family trio popped in here after walking from apt through Brooklyn Bridge Park and the Dumbo flea market so we were parched and in need of liquid barley fuel.  What was cool was they had a Star Wars trivia starting, and we played for one round before I realized I don't know NEARLY as much about Star Wars as I thought. They had paper masked which were fun so my Lil Bean transformed into BB-8 for the time being. When I do my weekend stroll, I will definitely come back for another friendly visit..This is part classy local haunt, part dive bar. The drinks are nothing fancy but there's a lot of space and the ambience is cool. I'm pretty sure they have good drink specials, too. Tbh I had a few too many when I was there (not too too many, but a few : ) so specifics are blurry - but I had a good time and stayed out late without any problems getting seats for my group of 5..68 Jay St is definitely the place for happy hour drinks and building relationships with coworkers. This dive bar has strong drinks for cheap and is one of the original bars in the Dumbo area in Brooklyn, NY. Stop by this bar if you're looking for a chill night out, good vibes, and reasonable priced drinks!Good for pre-gaming as well!.This place is run by a couple of fuckin jerkoffs. I went last night (July 4th) with a large group of about 20 people after watching the fireworks in Brooklyn Bridge Park, and we weren't even allowed to enter the bar, for absolutely no reason other than we were a big group.We had tried Randolph Beer which was well beyond capacity and were just looking for a place to relax and have a beer or two after a long day in the sun. We weren't rowdy, we weren't obnoxious, and the bar was completely empty because they had just opened at 11 and we were the first ones there, but the old douchebag who I assume owns the place denied us entry because they ""couldn't have 20 people in the bar"".It takes a special kind of stupid to turn away a large group, many of whom were travelers on their last night in New York, looking to spend money, but that's exactly what happened and it's absolutely unacceptable. As a lifelong New Yorker, I have only experienced this kind of bullshit treatment once at a bar and that place was out of business three months later.Get your shit together, nobody even knows your bar exists and we went out of our way to find you only to be turned away by your incompetence. You suck..Excellent ambience .....good whiskey & great musicians Nice laid back vibe No nonsense atmosphere and friendly ......worth one or several visits.A solid dive bar somewhat hidden in this area of Dumbo.There are a lot of bars and restaurants in this neighborhood that elevate their prices due to the high influx of tourists and generally wealthy residents, but Jay St. Bar keeps it pretty real. It's a pretty stark place with some local art on the walls, but not much going on besides that. Almost looks like they began a buildout and said, ""screw it--lets just sell some beer."" With plenty of room and a local following, it's a cool spot to start or end your night..It's a crap shoot here. Sometimes it's Kate or Julian or the woman who plays music (forgot her name) working behind the bar and they're amazing. Other times it's some curly haired woman who asks why you're getting a margarita during happy hour and acting incredulous that she has to mix a drink. Apparently the stress of working behind a bar gets to her--she should find another job. And then there's the huge  open windows with smokers sitting RIGHT in front of it, wafting smoke into the bar, which usually smells like mildew. And the owner sits outside not giving a damn. Nothing I say will make this place fail because the standards in dumbo are so damn low that this place can thrive just because it had a happy hour and thanks to those first three bartenders. Update: it seems like the smoking issue has been remedied by closing the window.It's a crap shoot here.

No music but guess it always you to talk to peeps a little easier Quality: 5/5- Service is awesome. The bartender is a great guy.- Cocktails are well priced and good quality.Great local bar. Fun place to meet locals and meld minds. Shout out to Jesse the bartender. He setup this offering to the elder gods!.Great happy hour. 2:30-7p. $4 draft beer BROOKLYN lager and $5 house wines and excellent a/c on a hot summers day. It's a friendly no frills bar. Just the kind I like that doesn't have the pretension of the new places in Dumbo. So if I have an hour to spend or a meeting in the area this place is great because it doesn't get too loud and it has a clean and cozy atmosphere."
"This place is pretty good for the price you pay. It's &5.99 per pound from 1 to 1:40 pm and then 1:40pm to 3:30pm its 4.99 per pound. Best prime time is after 3:30pm when it's 3.99 per pound. This is much cheaper than the usual options which are usually 10$ per pound etc The general tao chicken is good and so is the spicy chicken and the greens. Fast and good service.I used to go to this place a lot in the early 90's when I worked in the neighborhood.  Later I moved to the area and would come here from time to time.It was always a decent buffet.  Now that buffets are a thing of the past, as a take out venue it's decent.  It would never be my first choice for take out, but as a backup it's fine.I would recommend staying with simple dishes.  Anything with a complex sauce I would stay away from.Delivery is quick and it's very inexpensive..$8 - $10 lunch special is ok by me.I work close by and some days just feel like engorging on some sodium laden Americanized Chinese food for lunch.Then go back to my desk and try not to fall asleep.Large menu of items on the lunch menu. Go fatty or go healthy. The choice is yours. There is even a pretty sizable buffet in here so you can mix and match different items. Go crazy!No place to sit, plus it's hot as swamp ass in here anyway, so grab a bench or table outside if the weather is nice. It's small and basically a grab and go joint..For downtown Manhattan near my job, you can't beat the price & portion & quality. Fast orders. Friendly staff. I'm not sure how much has changed after covid but before that love the buffet portion. You can get a chicken stick for a little over a $1..Terrible, just terrible. How can a simple order of broccoli and garlic sauce taste so bad. I had two bites and decided to trash it. It was a total waste. I won't return..Tucked away in the streets of FiDi, you'll find this little gem. With so much selection, it's hard to narrow down exactly what you want. Pricing is great for both hot buffet-style section (per lb) and menu items. When ordering off the menu, you'll be surprised with generous portions that are well worth your money. They've got tables outside the restaurant as well, so it's a great place to eat on your lunch break.I got some dumplings and chicken lo mein to go, as well as perused the hot bar and grabbed a little bit of everything. They cooked up my food right away and the whole process overall was pleasant and speedy. Hands down the best pork pan-fried dumplings I've had in a long time. Lo mein as well as the hot bar food had great flavor and really hit the spot. I'll definitely be back soon (for those amazing dumplings, especially)..This is a decent Chinese-American PATP (pay by the pound) place in downtown Manhattan.  It has the usual Chinese-American dishes you might expect at your local Chinese takeout.  The service was at most, good and efficient.  If you arrive here after 3pm, they discount the per pound price to $5.29, a very reasonable price.  The food was tasty, nothing special.  The seafood fried rice is good, but the bok choy and the string beans were old.  The spicy chicken was good, as well as the char siu, which was made of pork belly due to how tender it is.  However, the chili oil they provide is weird for my taste and really spicy.  The dumplings were average, but the dumpling sauce was good.  I would come back again for the special if I'm in the area..Found our new go-to Chinese takeout spot! My husband picked up our to-go order two nights ago and we had a great dinner (& I enjoyed leftovers for lunch the next day!). They have a huge selection and I was pleased to see one of my favorites, Moo Goo Gai Pan, on the menu. It was excellent as was his shrimp dish. We also enjoyed two egg rolls and the pork fried rice. The prices aren't cheap but aren't ridiculous either. They included a face mask which I thought was a nice touch. Will definitely order from here again..I order mealpal from this restaurant few times a week. They are quick and they have some orders ready during lunch hour. But if you come after lunch hour, they will just make it when you arrive..Very inexpensive Chinese restaurant/buffet in the Financial District. I usually go for the buffet style and get a mixture of their vegetable lo mein/fried shrimps/fried chicken, which adds up to $5 and change. Nothing exotic, but the food is tasty and fresh."
"Love this local spot. Their branzino is cooked perfectly. They give such a large portion and the lemon potatoes are a great side. It also did come with a complimentary side dish of rice. I need to try other dishes from here but the branzino so far has been an obsession of mine..A once-reliable neighborhood Greek thinks it has become a Madison Ave foodie Mecca--or so you would think from the prices which hover close to, or over, $40 for most entrees. Salads and appetizers are north of $20. If I want those prices, I'll travel S to Danny Meyer. My rating reflects deep disappointment in what can only be called price-gouging at what was once a beloved--and much-needed--neighborhood joint. FYI, this restaurant  thrived during the pandemic because of its lucky corner location with tons of outdoor space. Their new iPad menus suggest the restaurant doesn't even know what to do with all the $$$ coming in Via it's overpriced menu....Went here for a small group celebration and it is a very nice atmosphere. We had the pita dip tasting appetizer, which was really flavorful. The waiters brought us more pita as we needed it as well.Had the lavraki fish and potatoes, which was really tasty, and the wine options are really great as well. Baklava for dessert did not disappoint either! Highly recommend this spot..I ordered delivery timing was great food arrived quickly, I ordered the Greek salad with chicken. Omg it was so good loved it. I also ordered the 3 spreads eggplant, hummus, and spicy feta, it was so yummy. The order came with warm pita bread and multigrain bread. I tried the orzo soup it was also very tasty. Can't wait to dine in the restaurant..Delicious food and wine, super kind staff, and beautiful outdoor and indoor setup! Nicholas and Catherine were amazing and very helpful. The portions may look small but are filling, and go great with some greek wine!.I never get tired of this place - it's one of my go-tos. Super cute for a date and also great to order in (which is what I did for most of the pandemic) I have celiac disease and it is hard to find a place that doesn't poison me. I trust Korali. My favorite items are the octopus and the lemon potatoes. Absolutely delectable. Never fails. Their tsatziki is also phenomenal. Sometimes they throw it in for free which is lovely. I would definitely recommend and will continue to patronize..Very good  food, friendly staff and a very nice experience. We shared two Spreads, one Appetizer, one Main Course and one Dessert. See pictures.... We would surely recommend this restaurant to friends.The greek salad was the best part, so so good, feesh and delicious! The fish was okay, not something I wanted to try again! Also, I didn't like the lemon potatoes it wasn't completely baked!.Fresh, high quality Greek fare with a lovely atmosphere inside and out. The staff is warm and welcoming. We came on the first night of indoor dining and although the outside was packed, the host was respectful of our decision to eat outside. We ordered the grilled octopus and Greek salad. While the dishes are pricey and only moderately sized, the food is fresh and well-prepared. The best Greek food on the UES!.I've had it!--I don't have any problem paying 100 dollars or more for two people at dinner, or 200 for that matter--I do have a problem paying these prices for food that is neither special, or even ordinaryWe had a dinner tonight at Korali, a Greek restaurant on 3 Ave/92 StreetThe bill came to $150, tip included--no liquor, no desert, no coffee, not even any bread on the table!--to call the food ordinary is a compliment--the salads were good, the main dishes swordfish, and a pork dish were small and as I said, very ordinary--oh yes, and my pork dish was served with a pile of french fries suited for a hamburger!When we arrived for our 7 pm reservation the maitre'd made a big deal out of trying to seat us, making us feel that we were lucky to get seated--when we left at 7:45 the restaurant was 3/4 empty!Korali is a perfect example of what has happened to many of our neighborhood restaurants--food quality down, prices up--I understand the hardship the pandemic has placed on you--but please, charging high prices for average food won't buy you many steady customers, who are the foundation of our neighborhood restaurants!."
"My friends and I ordered take out from this spot recently. I decided on the salmon teriyaki dinner bento box ($19), which was quite a lot of food! The meal consisted of 3 nice sized pieces of salmon, white rice, veggie tempura, shrimp shumai, salad, and roll of my choice. I selected the shrimp tempura roll. The salmon was wonderfully tender, succulent, juicy, and I enjoyed the sweet, teriyaki sauce full of flavor that accompanied it. The veggie tempura (broccoli, onion, carrot, sweet potato) was also really tasty. The batter was delightfully crispy and light. In addition, the veggies were nice and fresh. The shrimp shumai was great! It was cooked to the perfect texture and well seasoned. The shrimp tempura roll was yummy and had a lovely, satisfying crunch. Prices are quite reasonable and I had plenty of food left over. There are some yummy sounding Rice and Noodle dishes, Special Rolls, and Desserts. I know that I definitely want to try the King Lobster Roll and Coppa Pistachio!.It's not bad, ordered a poke bowl from here which was decent enough. Tuna didn't taste the freshest but salmon and yellowtail were alright. They gave a decent amount of fish too, There's a wide variety of topping choices and you're able to select quite a few.  Not the best place to get poke in the area but it made for a pretty good dinner overall..Kimchi fried rice with bacon and their spicy poke bowl are usually my go-tos for this place. Very generous portions and tasty food! Service is pretty quick but it's good to order ahead of time for pick up!.Came here on an afternoon the day before Thanksgiving. I ordered a Pokebowl for the very first time. It was interesting. It's basically an Asian salad with everything not mixed in. I ordered a large Pokebowl with mixed greens and everything else except of onions. I should've told them no sesame seaweed and no avocado and edamame. Oh well. The bowl itself was not bad but the yuzu dressing was terrible. I would get it again but not with that dressing. The place had nice decor with good amount of seating. This is a quick in and out to eat though because once you're done eating, the waitress immediately hands you the check..A return visit that didn't disappoint!! Wife's poke bowl was made perfectly! I had the shrimp tempura and veggie entree and a California roll that was delicious again. Packed with care and delivered on time. Definitely my go to place for Asian goodies!! Thanks Waza!!.The urge for sushi hit. But we usually order poke bowls from Waza and are never disappointed. So we decided to give their sushi a try. And sure enough, another satisfying meal. We ordered several shrimp tempura and tempura chicken rolls plus a mango roll. All were delicious. Lunches came with a small green salad that hit the spot on a warm afternoon. We'll definitely be ordering again soon!! Thanks Waza!!.Wow, WAZA Sushi & Ramen was excellent. Small touches are nice. WAZA Sushi & Ramen had just absolutely outstanding food. I had Godzilla Roll and really loved it. Team ensured that every thing was alright. Definitely a place to try out..Ordered chicken Katsu for dinner. The chicken was not edible. The meat was super rubbery. I had to throw it away. Will never eat there again..Ordered the Party Platter D for delivery and we were super happy with it! The fish was so fresh and beautifully organized in the platter. It was a great variety of sashimi and sushi (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, mackerel, white tuna, white fish, kani) and 4 rolls (spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, rainbow, dragon). I put in a pre-order for 6:30pm around 5pm and it arrived at 6:15pm! It was the perfect meal for 4 people. Will definitely be ordering again!.Waza has been my favorite go-to sushi spot during this pandemic and they've been super quick and efficient with my order each time. However, my recent order of salmon avocado roll was more of JUST an avocado roll. The ratio just isn't right lol.Sushi were extremely delicious, delivery guy asked me a tip, I tipped him! Then I opened my bag. I ordered WAZA love boats large for 115$  from Reg menu, - it's 125$ from delivery menu, I expected to see more food. . It's fine . But if you are planning make a party make sure you order 2 large WAZA love boats. 1 order is not enough for small party"
"Catching up on reviews from Pre-Covid times...Food: 4/5Ambiance: 3/5Service: 3.5/5Overall:  I've been coming to this place for years and everytime I come back to NY I make it a point to come to this place.Food:Carne Guisada - 4/5 - Rice, plantains, beef, potatoes, and carrots...uh yes please!  This is my second go to when they don't have carne ripiada.  It's a hearty meal at a very good price.Ambiance:  It is a hole in the wall but the food is worth it for me.  Service:  So it can be hit or miss.  Some can be friendly...some can be rude.  But usually they are pretty nice to me when i attempt to speak in spanish..PROS1. Beef Stew is Tender and Good.2. Chicken Noodle Soup is Flavorful.3. Mangu is well made.4. Baked Chicken is Flavorful.5. Friendly Staff.CONS1. Chicken Stew is Tender but needs more Flavor..Authentic Latino restaurant food is on point  , their prices are respectable giving the fact where it is located in the flatiron / Chelsea area , sometimes when you order over the phone they either rush you on taking your order (not always though) or they'll put you on hold for a period of time (not to get discouraged about it though) just so that you are aware of what you might experience , also they close super early by 4:30pm so make sure you put in your order before their deadline , they don't stay open for dinner or a late lunch so that's out neither do they open on Sundays which really sucks. Besides that I will have to give them the priority over any other latino restaurants in the area , BE ADVISED THEIR FLAVOR WITH THEIR FOOD IS SPOT ON !!  I will always be willing to order from them , very authentic taste better than your local Chipotle and or Taco Bell guarantee you that !!!.A solid 3 stars. Given that there aren't many places to get authentic Spanish food, Latin American Restaurant is okay. I've had my coworkers rave about this place, so I was excited to try it out as sometimes I'm craving good Spanish food. The day I went I ordered a Cuban sandwich, with a side of madueros. Good, but not great. Not your typical Cuban sandwich. I found the Cuban sandwich very dry, i was dipping it with the mojito they left on the table. Since when does a Cuban sandwich need more flavor? However, once again.. for the area it is good. I'm also comparing it to Sophie's and anything is better then that. The madueros were way undercooked. They were a bit hard, pretty burnt and not sweet. Their staff is super friendly, and their prices are great. For the price, you can't beat it..RECOMMENDEDThis review is based upon more than thirty visits to this restaurant:I'm a big fan of the Latin American Restaurant. It is a very sparely decorated and homey space with TVs featuring soccer games and Hispanic soaps.The friendly and hard working waitresses wear red uniforms and baseball caps. The aforementioned waitresses take orders quickly after your arrival and food arrives quickly.In my experience, I've always been able to get a seat at peak lunch times.On 2/26/16 I lunched here and ordered a Cuban Sandwich.The bread was fresh, with a perfect texture. The cheese was melted nicely and further melted in my mouth as I tasted it.The interior pork and ham was moist, tasty and not fatty.It was a delicious sandwich!As an alternative to the Cuban Sandwich, when I desire a heavier lunch, I order the Pernil (Roast Pork Shoulder) entree which comes with rice and beans. I choose my rice yellow and my beans black. The entree arrives with a plentiful, fatty, but not too fatty, portion of dark pork with a falling off the bone texture.It is seasoned exceptionally and always arrives with a nice amount of pork skin.The rice and bean sides are ample in portion and very flavorful. The price tag for this great lunch is about $12.00, after tip.The Latin American Restaurant is and will remain a vital part of my lunch rotation. It should be part of yours if you work near the 20 or 30 blocks of Manhattan..Went here for lunch as part of weekly team outing. Everything about this place was too authentic for your average white-collar office plankton. Starting with the smell, menu which does not describes dishes, and poor service. Dining room was too hot. Chairs are somewhat small. And service is non-existent due to the volume of people eating here. Finally it is overpriced to for the experience received: just 4 blocks away is a superb place that would be happy to amaze you for the same price level.I am giving this place 2 start because it is not hopeless, it may be an interesting experience to visit once if you are hungry for unusual food and happen to be on this block. At the same time, if only the price was cut down to 50% - my rating would jump up for sure. But at the same time dining room was filled, so I guess there is no shortage of guests. Count this place as an authentic Spanish dormitory-grade food place..Service was ok, not the friendliest. The cashier was at least smiling, possibly because he was collecting the cash. I ordered the baked chicken, black beans and yellow rice.  The baked chicken was overly cooked, it was so hard my knife refused to slice the meat. I eventually had to use my fingers to pull the meat a part. Wasn't truly seasoned well, I'm associated basic seasons were used.  The yellow rice was flavorless, not even salt was added. Thank goodness for the black beans. The beans were actually flavored and brought the rice to life. I've had better Dominican food in the Bronx..Good:  They updated the ceiling and repainted the restaurant.Bad:  The chicken was VERY dry!Ugly:  The staff should be more mindful when they speak Spanish in front of paying customers.The customers they talk negatively about, could secretly understand and speak the language!.Great food in large portions, especially for the price!.Really awesome mofongo and a total hole in the wall joint..latin american restaurant is a certified authentic latin cuisine , listen folks not only is the food scrumptious & flavorful it is gratifying for your wallet as well . you bet i will continue to order from this place . the only reason i give it 4 stars is because they close early by 4 or 5pm , which i think they can reconsider to stay open for a later time , as for now during this whole corona craze , it's an excellent restaurant & there you have it !!"
"Good local neighborhood pub. Came during off peak hours so there were plenty of space for social distancing. Ordered fries - came out nice and fresh. Also ordered Mango Margarita - pretty nice and punchy. If you have Amex - this place triggered the $5 shop small credit..Dirty Irish bar. They don't check your vaccination card. Bartenders have huge attitude. Don't recommend. Wings use to be good until they fired cook. Much better choices on 23rd..Sean ruins the place with his obnoxious attitude with his tan abd Canadian goose jacket. The guy is a fraud and ruins otherwise good vibe..Alright college bar. However one night this tweaky bartender took my credit card - claimed i never gave it to him and started yelling at me. Then started demanding I pay while barely checking - would bet that he was on something. Would not recommend if you have legs to walk anywhere else..Pretty standard pub in the area. They don't have a beer menu on paper, rather it is on a chalkboard somewhere as I guess they change what's on tap every go often. Not too crowded and pretty friendly service when I came here on a Saturday afternoon. Don't know what else to really say as I only came here solely for drinks with a group of friends. Good selection of draft beers I guess?.Worst place ever. Owner is extremely rude. He threatened to kick me out because I simply asked if we were going to be charged for the bottled water that he forced us to take when we asked for a water. Food was horrible, drinks are overpriced, service is beyond bad. Do not go here..Your typical Irish bar. Even though it's near a college, the age range is wide. I saw more people over thirty than below. There are ten TVs, about ten tables, and a long bar with tons of seats. It's pretty casual and laid-back. There's music playing, but it's easy to have a conversation. The mozzarella sticks were thick and juicy. They have darts. Couple friendly bartenders. Solid Murray Hill bar..Ever wonder what it's like to be struck with genius? Or perhaps touched by Jesus? Well that's what it's like walking in to Fitzgerald's pub. You'll be greeted by a goddess by the name of Cathy who will show you the meaning of life and serve the elixir of life. A second to none experience, and a second to none return on investment. I suggest you go..Really really friendly staff , most definitely coming back here. Plus good drinks ! Had me f'd up after one LOL! Also had the appetizer sampler , very good loved the onion rings . I was greeted very nicely by a man and woman who told me to sit where ever I wanted , my family and I chose outside . We had two guy waiters who were extremely friendly and helped with my fathers drinks which was really nice. Also was greeted by some girl in the bathroom hahah that was super nice , overall good vibes.I've been here on a couple of random occasions in the past few years when it was very late and not much was open in the area. Came in to grab a quick drink before a show nearby because I saw the Happy Hour sign, and figured it was worth it. Sat at the bar, the bartender greeted me, but his energy was horrible. He seemed like he didn't want to be there. Would mention his name but the receipt didn't include it (more on that later). He asked me what I wanted and while I was looking at the drink menu and had just started to spit ""um.."" out he straight up walked away and went to the couple a few seats down and took their order. Why even ask if you're not going to wait for a response? When he came back with the same uninterested demeanor, I ordered a glass of wine, card in hand. He poured it, set it down, asked if I wanted to keep a tab open; I declined and asked him to close it. He THEN said there was $15 minimum on cards (HH is like $7 per drink), which I didn't realize. And he could have mentioned that as my card was in hand. He said I could ""just order another drink or a shot"". I explained I was just in for a quick drink before a show (the show was in 20 minutes) and I just wanted one. Of course he was still stiff about it and acted as if he didn't care. I then asked if he knew of a Chase Bank nearby, and he looked at me as if it was a crazy question. ""Uhmmm. No."" I was annoyed and worried that he would hassle me about paying for the drink if I just walked out, so I ordered a shot of house tequila which he claimed would meet the minimum.He took much longer than necessary to run my card, and when I received my receipt it wasn't even itemized. No record of what I was charged for, just the total. And what's even more suspicious is that after dropping the check he didn't even come back to the bar. I definitely wouldn't return here again because of how uncomfortable the experience was. Spend your $ elsewhere!.We chose this bar due to it's close proximity to our hotel. Turns out it's a killer Irish pub with great bartenders, moderately priced drinks, darts, and bar food. Cormick was our main bartender throughout most of the week,  he was friendly and very generous with the Tullamore Dew. As well as an extremely efficient bartender. We never had to wait for a drink regardless of how packed the place was. The welcoming service and inexpensive bar tabs kept us coming back night after night. Will definitely return next time we are in the neighborhood!"
"Fabulous, delicious food, warm welcoming staff.Beyond clean, homemade pasta, best desserts in town. Hidden gem!!!.Came here for dinner on a weekday. The restaurant was pretty empty and we were seated quickly. The staff were super friendly and helpful in helping us choose what to order. The food was pretty average - not the best I've had in the city. Everything was slightly on the saltier side, so I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. If you want any alcohol, I would recommend getting wine instead of any of their cocktails..I came here for dinner with a few friends and don't think I'd go again. I'd recommend going to another Italian restaurant. Food = 3/5 : Overall the food isn't bad but also isn't materially better than the average place you walk into in Little Italy despite prices being materially higher. The flat bread was the best dish I had.Ambience = 3/5: demographic skews older and very white. When we came for dinner we were the only minorities in the restaurant.Service = 3/5 : while not bad, the service wasn't great. I ordered a wine bottle and they brought a cheaper vintage back and were about to open it before I stopped them. Only then did they informed me that they ran out of the vintage I ordered..The food was not as good as Portofino in Queens. The endive and artichoke salad was not as crisp, tasty or plentiful, and I was charged $10/$14, unlike the $7 half-price for half the salad I was charged at Portofino.The home-made pasta was good. The shrimp were not cooked enough. My own shrimp, baked then stir-fried with oregano and thyme at home are better.The profiterole was good enough, although none can beat Café Dante in the East Village, now closed.The atmosphere is good and the server was professional and polite.The restroom was clean..Great airy space with an upscale vibe. The servers were really kind and attentive -- taking their time to explain different menu offerings. We came for team lunch and it good came out sooner than we're used to and hottttt! The focaccia they bring to start is also quite delicious. Ordered the shrimps fra diavola over house-made papardelle. The sauce was good -- you could tell it was home made with whole chunks of garlic and plum tomatoes. But the shrimp just tasted old -- gummy with little flavor. One colleague ordered the chicken breast and enjoyed it  the another ordered spaghetti with seafood from the lunch menu but said it wasn't great...All in all, I think it's worth it to give this place another shot ..I went here with my mom for a fancy pre-theater lunch. The service was very attentive. She found some of her veal marsala tough, and I wasn't particularly pleased with the vegetarian options, but overall, the food was tasty. Especially her marsala sauce. The desserts were lovely, we shared a tiramisu and profiteroles. Both were delicious!.We came on a weeknight around the holidays, so it was fairly quiet.  We got a nice seat in the window and had a really lovely time.  Our waiter was professional and friendly and the food was amazing.  I had the cavatelli with sausage and broccoli rabe and my fiancé had the gnocchi.  My martini was the right size--the kind you can sip for like an hour.  I was so excited.    We received warm ""good nights"" on our exit and I really think this is everything a neighborhood restaurant should be. Also, bathrooms huge and very clean..So my mother and her friend went here for lunch Saturday. My mom is 84 and her friend is 95. My mother has some physical issues where she throws up and faints, it comes on suddenly without warning, but it hasn't happened for years. Unfortunatley yesturday out of the blue she had an attack at Amata's.The reason I am telling this story is because I am in the food industry business and the kindness and helpfulness they showed my mom and her friend was amazing. The waiter got ice in a napkin and rubbed her neck for 15 minutes to help the sick feeling pass, Unbelievable! The elderly are just not treated kindly anymore. From the manager to the staff the compassion and service at this resturaunt is off the charts, not to mention exceptional food. I thank you so much for taking care of my mom till I could get there. If there were 10 STAR'S you would get that from me.Warmest Alicia.I really enjoyed almost everything I had here. I started off with the burrata, which was okay, but not the best I've had. It would have been better if there was more balsamic on the plate. I then tried the cavatelli with sausage and broccoli rabe and penne alla vodka. The cavatelli was one of the best pastas I've had in a long time. It tasted so fresh and almost as soft as gnocchi. The penne alla vodka was also really good and I really liked the sauce. I also had the shrimp francese, which I did not enjoy. The shrimp did not taste fresh and I wouldn't get it again. The espresso martinis were also very good!.This place is my husband and I's Italian neighborhood staple. Usually drop in on week days around 8pm and we've never had trouble getting a seat. In fact we've brought his mother here who could be rather selective, and she had a great time. Phew!Menu is pretty diverse. Usually get the Caesar salad, and I've had the chicken martini which comes with parmesan crusted medallions, lemon, butter & martini wine. My husband usually opts for pasta and is always impressed. If you order coffee, the staff usually brings little biscotti, which is always appreciated. Great wine list, great service, great time. So glad to have a place like this nearby!"

"The best Chinese food in this area!!!!!!I always stop by when I'm in the area.Their 30 shrimp with pork fried rice is a steal for10.00!! Clean deveined shrimp!.Terrible!!!!!! This location is nothing like the other Hardee's stay far away,  The food wasn't fresh at all I threw everything  big away waste of money..I need to put pictures on this review but don't have any right now. That place is amazing as far as corner Chinese restaurants go! Amazing I tell you. Ana is such a beautiful and wonderful person. People leave all the way from the Bushwick side to up to Oceanhill for their food. I usually get various shrimp dishes... every single one is delicious!!! I've tasted general tsos and chicken and broccoli.  Trust, every dish is fresh and mouth watering!!.Perfect Chinese food. Clean, delish, accepts my requests for no plastic containers. Wish they delivered!"
"We have been ordering from Happy Garden for the last 20 years. The food is always good. The service is friendly and accomodating..TERRIBLE SERVICE. The man upfront was rude, the food was terrible. If you want cold food GO HERE..Ordered as a last resort. General Tso's chicken came out quicker than it went in AND I found a hair in it. Feathers still on the pieces so at least you know it's not cat I guess. This place should be shut down..I ordered food before and when I got it was great but lately the food doesn't taste the same the beef lo mein use to be great now it's horrible this will be the last time I order from this establishment.Honestly the food sucks.. don't bother with the sweet and sour chicken.. just don't eat anything.. the food is weird af!.Lets just say I was dying on the toilet for 30min hours after eating the food.. Smh.. Ran through like water and I rarely get the runs.The food is always freshly prepared and they are always nice whether it's delivery, dine in or take out. Good Special offers and open late which is convenient. Love coming here when I'm home!.Came to this place to an order some food not so long ago.  I noticed a mouse scurrying in the back.  So disgusted.  I will never eat from there again..Food wasn't the best. Also forgot half my order so it had to be delivered a half and hour later and it wasn't what I had order. I will not be ordering from them again. If I could give zero stars I would!!!!!.They took over an hr to deliver  and the food sucked....the delivery man was very rude and nasty and made us go to the car to get thefood. How can chicken wings be nasty....looked fried 5 times and rice was bland.  Never again!!!!.Doesn't deliver to the area advertised, so don't waste your time calling."
"Bronx's Little Italy on Arthur Avenue has no shortage of Italian eateries dripping with old school (and old world) charm. After a day out at the Bronx Zoo, we walked into Emilia's for an early dinner. The dark dining room lends a romantic vibe while the menu has a wide range of familiar dishes (antipasto, calamari, zucchini flower starters, chicken and veal mains, fresh pastas). We split an antipasto platter and each ordered a pasta (hers: gnocchi and burrata in vodka sauce, mine: pappardelle in bolognese)The food was phenomenal: that antipasto platter had creamy fresh mozzarella, bracingly salty prosciutto, smoky roasted peppers, briny olives, and a truffle provolone) while the pastas were cooked perfectly (the vodka sauce not too heavy, with just enough punch while the bolognese was rich and meaty). The meal was capped with a surprisingly light tarte with cannoli cream and fresh berries..My husband & I had a lovely evening dining at Emilia's on a Thursday evening.  The restaurant is a good size and we were given a table at the front by the window.  The waiter was great with excellent suggestions & descriptions of the food.  We ate a ton and each plate of food was better than the next.  We ordered so much that we took 3 containers back home.  A superb evening with great service and delicious food!.After a long day at the zoo, my friend recommended her family's favorite Italian restaurant.We weren't super hungry but still ordered a bunch of food.(Not pictured) their bread- when you sit down they come over and give you a giant basket of warm bread with butter, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I didn't want to eat the bread because I was saving my stomach for the food we ordered but it just looked so good!!! EAT THIS and somehow find room for more food!!!! Fried Calamari - perfectly battered, seasoned and fried. It was a pretty sizable appetizers portion for the 3 of us but the marinara sauce is out of this world. We just wanted to dip everything in this sauce! Ask for extra lemons!! Insulate Tre Colore - very bitter salad because of the ingredients (yes, I knew it was supposed to be bitter) lol but it complimented the calamari perfectly! Add some lemon and pepper to cut the bitterness down a little!! Chicken parmigiana - I shared this with my sister because I knew I was going to be stuffed after the appetizers. The waiter was nice enough to split the order into two plates so we didn't have to share and pass! This chicken parm was perfectly cheesey and cooked and still tastes bomb dot com while being full.Pappardelle Bolognese - this was AMAZING! I had a bite of my friends and honestly they knocked it out of the park. The pasta is fresh and homemade and the sauce is meaty and flavorful. 10/10 would recommend and would come back to order!!The backyard area is nice and cute! The tables are pretty spaced out and there's a cover over most of the tables with heaters facing inwards. We loved the little waterfall situation they had going on and felt 100% safe dining outdoors!!!.Ate at Emilia's about this past summer. It was a fantastic meal. They have a tent set up for outdoor dining (which is what we did) and they also offer takeout. We ordered the Mozzarella Caprese, the Fettuccine with Swordfish dressed with Truffled Oil, and the Lamb in a brown butter sauce with Risotto. We also got a bottle of Chardonnay to go with our meal. The Fettuccine was delicious, you tasted the truffle without it overwhelming the dish. The lamb was super tender, and the risotto was nice & buttery. For dessert we decided on their Coconut Sorbet (served in a coconut shell!) and Dark Chocolate Cake. The coconut sobert was great - velvety, creamy. The chocolate cake was moist, not overly sweet which I appreciate. All in all a delicious meal..Very nice meal. Had a table with a street view. Good service. Fresh and generous portions. Will come back again..This review is only for their pick up services. I've ordered pick up from here twice so far. Their food items can be a hit or miss. Ordered for a family of 5. We ordered different items from the menu both times. Their portions really depend on the food item. My famiy loved the seafood platter. I ordered the Cheese ravioli which wasn't amazing, I'd definitely not order it again just because I didn't really love it. The fettuccine Forestire was amazing!! I ordered it once and someone else ordered it a second time. The portions for it are definitely sharable between 2 people. The restaurant provided us with complimentary bread - it was delicious. They lost two stars because they forgot two items from the order and when I called to inform them, they knew and did not bother contacting me. Also, We had ordered fried calamari and it was cold and chewy. It almost tasted old. Their services are for dine-in and pick up/take out only. They seem to have indoor dining during COVID. The staff were wearing masks and there was hand sanitizer readily available it seems..This spot we stumbled upon on a Monday afternoon! No reservations needed. Out fort seating in the back with a heated and covered patio! I would recommend sitting outside than in. The food was great! The steak cooked to beat perfect. We also had an order of the truffle pasta dish but subbed the original pasta with cavatells, I would recommend getting a pasta that's made in house, it was beyond amazing! The drink list is your classics, espresso, French, and a wide variety of wine..Delicious. Family business that welcomes you with open arms. The bolognese was delicious and the perfect amount. Highly recommend..I love this place. I come here often to have lunch while my daughter naps with her father. The service is always great, food is always good and the bread is always amazing. I  always get gnocchi..I was very impressed with the service of Emilia's! My group sat on the heated outdoor patio in the back which was a nice alternative to the sometimes noisy street. Their starting bread was great, our food came quickly, and everyone enjoyed their meal. My friend and I each got the truffle pasta special and while it was nice, there wasn't a ton of truffle flavor. It seemed more like a mushroom dish with a touch of truffle. Still, overall a good dish. Our waiter also gave us a free cannoli when we ordered one! The cannolis were amazing - has a touch of orange and chocolate chips. A nice spot with good prices and even better service!"
"I order from here at least once a week, and whenever I have my friend over for dinner she insists we order from Chen Yuan because of how tasty it is.Chinese takeout usually doesn't vary too much, but for some reason this place is above average. The service is so friendly and best of all the prices are insanely good for this area..They are nasty and rip you off when never they can, they used some shit that makes you sick so becarfull.No longer take credit cards and not very nice or patient on the phone anymore, can't tell if it's new management? Now no longer my go to for Chinese food..Love this family run Chinese joint, my go to for Chinese takeout in the neighborhood. They are nice and patient on the phone, make some food substitutions as requested, their food is fresh and delicious and they take credit cards..I noticed the gentlemen overcharged me for my food, and asked him for the price of each item (as I didn't have the menu in front of me) He got angry then hung up the phone. A chinese restaurant that is clearly taking advantage of the gentrification..If I can give this place no stars I would!! Terrible! I've lived in this community over 20 years.This owner has gotten worse and unfortunately it has hurt his business.I went in and ordered food. He said $22. Then he saw my card he said $26. I asked him that's tax, he said yeaaaa. Does not start making my food.Then a white man enters and orders food. Also paying with card. When his food was done, he let him pay with his card no problem. After he leaves he asks me are you ready. I said yes. He says no to pay!I told him I've never had to pay before you made my food before, why now. He kept demanding me to pay and then finally says ""you people sometimes don't have money on your card so pay now"".... What?! How disgusting. Even still I remained calm because this isn't my first rodeo with him or this establishment. I've also seen how they've treat others-terrible. I then tell him as a member of this community over 20 years and being here multiple times I couldn't believe his behavior and he should be ashamed. Hearted getting lots saying pay first.Ipull out my camera...he instantly recognize who I was and even recalled my address since my family orders from there enough to know (Not me though). He starts saying on camera I'll make it now don't worry... LOL. I couldn't believe it. A customer was about to come in and also witnessed his behavior and said he would never return. I honestly tried to get him to understand how being prejudice or racist will hurt his business and better not to assume but instead he continued to talk over me.A LOST CAUSE..The best Chinese food in Bushwick. Chicken and broccoli in garlic sauce is the best, orange chicken is 5/5. Fast delivery, friendly and very affordable. This is the spot for Chinese food..This place is an great little place fo typical NYC style Chinese food.It's a small corner location with two tables for seating. Mostly a take out place but you can sit down for a lunchtime meal. I've tried most of the staples General​ Tso's, lo main, chicken with broccoli, fried dumplings, egg rolls,  and it's all solid. The wonton soup is above average in my opinion. The half fried chicken and fried rice combo is a good deal of food for the price. I live a few blocks away and usually pick up my order. It's generally done in 15 minutes or less. Overall pretty good place for Chinese food..I order from here all the time, for the past year. Food is on point. I usually get the orange chicken with either chicken fried or House fried rice. Their crab Rangoon is delicious also..this place is your classic corner chinese food but they must have extra MSG because this is the best cheap chinese food place i've ordered from. the owner and boss-dad of the place is super chill and the service is super quick. never had food poisoning, so cheap, flavorful and fast is why this place gets 5 stars.Honestly the food is good. It's great. However time and time again I keep giving them chances but their customer service is off the charts disrespectful. Also restaurant closes in the middle of the day randomly. Unfortunately I will not be ordering from this restaurant anymore."
"This place is tiny. No tables-just an order counter and a counter on the window for people who choose to stay & eat in. I went for lunch with a friend on a weekday and the place was empty short of 2 other people making carry out orders. Our server-who's name slips my mind- was very kind, well informed, and more than willing to answer my multiple questions. I wanted to know about noodle sizes, protein options, sweetness/spiciness of many of the dishes, & whether they had Coca Cola or Pepsi. I ended up getting a spicy steak/noodle dish that I really enjoyed with lime squeezed into it. My vegetarian friend got a tofu dish that she was less than enthused with the taste of-hence the 4 stars. I couldn't take off any more than that as the sheer amount of food we both got as part of the lunch special was out of this world! We both had leftovers after stuffing our faces with a huge portion of food!"
"So, on a hunt for my local hood Chinese spot, the reviews on this place were doable. We ordered Shrimp Egg Foo Young , Chicken in Garlic Sauce and crab rangoon. My Sister liked the egg foo you d and my chicken in garlic sauce came spicy and nice flavor. The fried rice was one of the better ones I've had. So I've found my spot for Chinese in the area. Delivery was fast and everything was packed nicely..Looks clean. Looks efficient. And definitely does the occasional Chinese food fix. Food is pretty good not that the place next door isn't that great anymore. Actually over the years this place hasn't disappointed me. This time is a bit different. First of all, I am addicted to yelps ordering with GrubHub and it's been a life saver.  Except need to pay some tax hehe, I don't have to make that call in the middle of a crowd and screaming my sesame chicken over with extra sesame over the phone. Back to the food, i found out they have a dinner combo special for like $10 which is reasons and beside that, the portion is actually enough for 2. Reason I love Chinese food. You get your bang for every dollar you spend. On top of that, they throw in a egg roll. Food for pick up is fast. I got there around 10 minutes after ordering, I got my stuff and on my way. Fyi guys if you read up to here, please ask for no fork or plastic bag for bonus. Enjoy..The food is always fresh and good.There vegetable roll is sensational.         A MUST TRY Best place in Kensington..The food is always fresh and good.There vegetable roll is sensational.         A MUST TRY. Try there duck dishit's delicis.First time ordering from here and very disappointed. Ordered a large Curry Beef (#66) and the flavor was awful. Hardly any curry taste and the vegetables had a funny metallic taste. My grandson ordered Sesame Chicken (S1) and the the dish looked really good. He really loves Sesame Chicken and was disappointed also with this dish.  He said some of the chicken pieces had an off taste.  Also ordered Fried Dumplings (#9) that seemed they were refried. The skins of the dumplings were hard and dry but the filling wasn't bad..I used to go to another Chinese restaurant but they unfortunately closed down and with that I needed to find a new one and Wing Hua 2 is really good. I usually order the same thing because it's so good (C30) but the ladies at the cash register is sweet and they would eventually know who you are. I highly recommend this place and give the people some love..Since moving into the neighborhood I've ordered from here dozens of times. The food was consistently yummy (and cheap), and delivery was always surprisingly quick. The perfect kinda place to order from when you don't feel like cooking dinner. Over the past month or two they've taken a total nose dive. My last couple of orders have taken over an hour and a half to arrive but I figured they were just having off nights. Tonight I opted to try pick up on my way home from work and unfortunately it wasn't any better. They forgot the sauce on one of the chicken dishes and the veggie fried rice had maybe two pieces of broccoli total. It's pretty tough to mess up wonton soup, but the filling tasted like old playdough. To top it off, the fortune cookies I always order (which they charge for btw) never managed to make their way into the bag. Guess it's time to find a new take out joint. Luckily there are a bunch to choose from on Church Ave..If I could give this business less than one star I would. I ordered food from here and it took me 2 and a half hours to even figure out what was going on with my order (keep in mind, their business is only 5 BLOCKS AWAY!) Finally my patience grew thin and I called the restaurant only for them to have me on hold for 20 minutes (I can only assume they hadn't even started my order or forgot it completely). Eventually, the phone disconnected and I, for whatever reason, couldn't get a hold of them again. I contacted eat 24 and they got in contact with them and told me my order was on its way. It finally arrived (after about 30 more minutes) and the delivery guy was extremely rude to me and even hassled me for not giving him a tip! Finally I opened my order, only for it to be WRONG and missing items. Thank goodness for Eat 24 for refunding my order. I tried to order something again today (hoping that my previous experience was a one time occurrence) and they've actually blocked me from ordering, or at least i assumed they did since on yelp it says ""sorry this place doesn't deliver to you"" lmao.Just figured I'd share my crappy experience. P.S., dont tip ahead of time, wait to receive your order and tip based off their service. Just tryna save you some money..An amazing restaurant for classic Chinese American food. Crunchy chicken wings, delicious crab rangoon, awesome sesame chicken, and their veggie fried rice is loaded with all kinds of veggies. There's a very kind counter girl and speedy service. My only gripe is they are cash only..Food is marginal. Portions are large. Delivery is abysmal ... repeatedly takes over 90 minutes for delivery. Please, someone open a good, reliable Chinese restaurant in Ditmas Park..The food here isn't good. Unfortunately the only good Chinese delivery place we've found in the neighborhood is vegetarian-only, and sometimes we want something else. Our order included mushu shicken (edible but weak, with machine-made pancakes and a cloyingly sweet sauce), chicken chow-fun (pretty good), and vegetable dumplings (so bad they went straight into the trash). I don't think I've ever taken a bite of a takeout order and just thrown out the rest, so these dumplings were a brand new low--thick, chewy, doughy, gluey skin, with pallid and flavorless filling. Are these stuffed with your cutting board scraps? Or did you buy them frozen from the lowest bidder?Come on, people. This is the food of utter thoughtlessness and neglect. The neighborhood doesn't need this. Why not act like you care?Two stars rather than one, because the best alternatives aren't much better. For the moment."
"Walking into the store, I thought it would be sub-par based on the location. However, as our different subs came out, they were still steaming until our last bites. I would recommend their hot foods over ready to go items!.Great little spot in the Financial district to grab a quick bite for breakfast or lunch! I was able to get my wrap and coffee within 5 minutes which is always a pleasant surprise. Also the staff is really warm and welcoming. They have oat milk for all my fellow non-dairy folks out there and they have a variety of options for breakfast. Many of them healthy too! Also the prices are quite reasonable so I would definitely check it out..Delicious! This teeny weenie breakfast cafe is my go-to lunch spot. They offer an assortment of healthy options at very reasonable prices. I suggest the healthy wrap & add in avocado & cheese - to die for! And only $8. They also have adorable fresh fruit cups for $2.75 for a little pick me up..With all of the expensive and high end delis in FiDi, it's good to know a quality eatery still exists! They have very reasonably priced breakfast sandwiches and platters and other specials. Their staff are also very friendly and courteous and their chefs are quick! They also serve up a good cup of coffee. Highly recommend stopping by this spot if you're in the area and looking for a lower priced meal with a home cooked flavor..This is my breakfast sandwich spot!! Good pricing and great sandwiches, especially compared to other options in this area. Give great portions, always get my order right, and the staff is always friendly.I grab breakfast here at least once a week. The staff is always friendly, the food always comes out quick and warm, and the quality is consistently good. I especially like their breakfast sandwiches, which are delicious and cheap - egg and cheese on a roll is only $2.50. Really a great neighborhood joint that  everyone living in FiDi should support..Really good breakfast sandwiches and very cheap!! Very friendly staff and quick to pick up. Yelps app made an incorrect order via grub hub but this store was quick to fix it when grub hub wouldn't..Incredible food for a quick grab. The hazelnut coffee is great and the two eggs bacon bagel is a banger..Service was quick and to the point.  They don't play with their brunch/lunch hours and what they'll serve at a certain time.  I wasn't even aware we came at a clutch time until the people after us tried ordering from the menu and had very few options to choose from. We all enjoyed our sandwiches and wraps.  I got a breakfast burrito, the babes both opted for grilled cheese with tomatoes or ham added.  My mom enjoyed her Reuben.  Great quality deli meat.  My only complaint is the veggies I paid extra for each were hardly present in my wrap.  Why upcharge me for two additions when you hardly add any at all?.Sooo good! was really looking for a good BEC in downtown manhattan and this was one of the best ones i've ever had! definitely going back"
"Not enough nice things to say about the service we received for a private luncheon last weekend. Everyone was wonderful, everything ran smoothly, the restaurant is charming. Strongly recommend if you are looking to host a 20ish person event in the area..I love this cozy neighborhood spot for excellent italian food. The menu is BIG and there are lots of options to choose from. I always leave looking forward to my next time to try something new. The wait staff is very nice and attentive. I had one of the new specials, it's a homemade linguine with ossobucco. It was amazing! I also love the pork ragu with homemade pappardelle. Will be back as always!.Love this little wine nook in Chelsea. In addition to a solid wine list, they gave us a pile of bread and oil, plus a plate of olives to snack on. Have been going here on and off for years and will continue..Great place for a lunch/dinner. Great food (especially specials) The staff is amazing and very attentive. Never had any issues with delivery as well.We ended up having dinner here somewhat by accident when our intended dinner spot in the area ended up being unexpectedly closed tonight. It was a happy accident, because we had a good experience!My husband really enjoyed the branzino. It was a nice portion with a good side dish of veggies and potatoes. I had the kale salad and the gnocchi, which was homemade and tasty. While the place looks a little lived in and maybe could use a coat of paint or a bit of updating, it was cozy, and the service was friendly. This is a good option if you are in the neighborhood and do not have a reservation, as they seemed ready to accommodate walk-in diners most of the time..Food 3.5/5.0Service 3.5/5.0Value 3.0/5.0Decor 3.5/5.0 Overall 3.5/5.0Nice outdoor dining setup with good partitioning between tables.  Food was generally pretty good, including my go-to chicken parm (not sure if that's considered basic).  Would come back.My husband and I have loved this place for years. We celebrated our 30 th anniversary here with friends. Elegant yet relaxing; old world service and an imaginative menu that is always grounded in classic Venetian cuisine. Recent meal: Superb red wine matched with a perfectly cooked duck breast. Caesar salad and fried artichokes. Perfect espresso. No room for dessert but they gave us a plate of tasty biscotti and chocolate treats..All in all was ok. Maitre d was just not wearing a mask upon entry, sitting us down and taking our orders.  Meatballs could be better tbh..I love this place the food is absolutely delicious, but the salad portions are insane for the price.  About 1/3 the amount there should be..This is our neighbourhood ""go to"" spot. It is classy, fun and the food is consistently delicious. The side bar is a hip and cool hangout spot. There is a secluded back room- outside dining and ambiance everywhere.We've been coming here since the day it opened. Claudio, the owner/manager, even let my daughter 'hostess' on breaks from college 17 years ago. Many special occasion family dinners held here over the last 25 years. Thank you Claudio for always making it worth it."
"Eoin is the best bartender on the upper east side! Highly recommend the espresso martini! Xoxo gossip girl.First of all, the service was spectacular! Our server made sure we had good seats and turned on the fan for us outside. My bf got the Guinness and agreed with other reviews that said it was a great pour! I got the passion fruit marg, even though it seemed like a beer bar, but was not disappointed! Both drinks were great and we'll definitely come back since I want to try some of their food (a bar that serves pig in a blankets!!)Overall, a fun and laidback bar with great service!.Eoin is the best bartender in the tristate area!.Love this neighborhood bar and Barry the bartender. Always a good time. It's a small dark bar filled with so many dudes. I live across from here and have wondered in late night by myself and made so many friends. They have regulars that frequent it and if you stay awhile, it gets pretty fun late at night and there is always the strap hangers from Dorian that are still seeking that last chance to take a girl home for some loving....A gem of a bar on the UES in Yorkville. Small, comfy neighborhood feel. The kind of place you can make quick friends at the bar. There's a little alcove in the back if you get there early enough, if you're feeling less social or have a small group of friends.Duncan the bartender is a really good guy. He'll take care of you. There's a nice selection of beer and they always have something locak, like Bronx Brew. It also has one of the best trivia nights in town on Mondays (starts around 8 pm). Don't miss it..Great bar. Highly recommend going here. Great bartender and clientele. Really good Guinness here at this bar..A great local pub in the Upper East Side.  Steps away from the Q, get out at 83rd St, take the escalator. Good beers on draft and more cans and bottles, including $5 daily specials on Founder's IPA, Modelo, Guinness Blonde, Michelob Ultra, Magic Hat. Friendly Bartenders and a comfy, intimate pub.  Located on 84th, between 2nd and 3rd Ave. This is a great bar to stop in with some friends, great for nightcap. Come here for Happy Hour after work, it's mellow then, a perfect way to unwind after a long day of work. You'll meet friendly people and have some great conversations. There is free WiFi.  It's a captive portal.  Tip, give your real email and you'll get an occasional offer to redeem a free beer. They don't spam, just an occasional message. Love this place, it's a such a benefit to have this in my neighborhood..Cute, tiny, cozy neighborhood pub with amazing service.  We were on the block waiting for another bar to open and honestly we should have stayed here ...the service here - both bartenders -  extremely friendly (I believe Barry was the super friendly guy) as were the locals who were at the bar. Vibe was chill and fun, like a place if you went a couple times they would know your name and you would get chummy with the customers at the bar and the bartenders I ordered and IPA and it was great..Nice friendly bar tender, quiet pub, great place to have a drink ... Love it!But no finger foods just drinks..Great Classic Pub!!!   Super Friendly bartenders and very welcoming.  We make sure to visit and have drinks with Gene & Staff on our Annual LACo Fire Department visits for St. Patty's Day..  Slainte!!! (CHEERS)"
The food here is very inexpensive and has very tasty food. The employees here are sometimes rude but like we know them for years now we just ignore them. Delivery is pretty fast but they always ask for tip..I like the food here. Not the best food I've tasted but it is the best Chinese restaurant in this area. The shrimp is always crispy. The food tastes fresh and the rice is tasty (rarely use soy sauce when I order from here). I wouldn't recommend ordering for delivery. I always order for pick-up because delivery takes too long.
"Decided to give this place a try due to all the negative reviews as I am one who is always willing to give a place a chance, and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of pizza. It looks doughy (which isn't a bad thing) when you see it for the first time but it's rather light and airy. Tried the cheese and pepperoni. If they can deliver this kind of pizza with consistency I'll order again. One star off for not being on the apps or being able to order from their own site (you have to call in and order, old school yes). As far as the negative reviews claiming of rudeness, I can't comment on that as my encounter with the person who took my order was quick and to the point..pizza was fine. one staff member was nice, the other, I think the boss, not so much. He didn't thank me, and re-packaged my slices into bags instead of the boxes that I asked for, after they had already went in the box. It was and will remain the last place I'd go for pizza in the neighborhood..Let me be clear, I like their pizza.  very good slice but the attitude is awful.  Went in to order, waited 5 min before someone even approached the pizza area and took my order.  Its like they couldn't be bothered with my order until they finished watching the soccer game.  I ordered the special that was advertised online for $12.99 for a large pizza.  they said it was now 15.99, I pointed out to them the sign right outside the store said $12.99.  They said they didnt have a chance to change the sign and they couldn't reach the web designer to modify the online price.  They ended the conversation with ""you want it or not?"".  I said no and I took my business to Lillian's up the block..Pizza was ok.  But the counter guy was so unfriendly I felt like I was imposing.  I'll spend my pizza $$ at Lillian's from now on..I've tried several Pizza places in the Forest Hills area and can say ""Mike's"" is without a doubt the absolute BEST in the biz!!!None of the competitors in the area can come close.I usually order a pizza slice every now and then but today I ordered a Veal Parm hero and it reminded me of my days growing up in the Bronx. It was just perfect! Really blew my mind! You know it's good when you moan after taking a bite, lol! That good!.Mike's Pizzeria & Restaurant is absolutely amazing. We couldn't believe how cheap this place was. Every thing I've tried so far has been terrific. The crew was extremely courteous and service is great. I'm certainly happy that I found Mike's Pizzeria & Restaurant..Didn't expect it but, Mike's Pizzeria & Restaurant was actually remarkable. Clean and cute atmosphere. Every single item that we ordered was super fresh and yummy. The staff is definitely a highlight of this place because they are always fast, courteous, and provide service with a smile! If you haven't tried Mike's Pizzeria & Restaurant, then you must go..Oh man!   For those of you ordering delivery, please read.   I just stopped in to get something quick to eat between jobs.    Of the 2 guys there neither wore gloves!   They grabbed my food with bare hands to throw in the oven then came back to the counter to take my money with those same hands.   Same guy decided to add pepperoni on a pie he just made with those same bare hands.   I even caught him sapping up oil from a slice, with a dirty rag, that he just used to clean the counter!!!!!  You never really know how your food is being prepared, at any restaurant, but to go in and see this makes a good customer disappear.   I will definitely not be returning but hope they start wearing gloves ESPECIALLY during COVID!.In the mid 1980's I worked a couple of doors down in the liquor store and this was one of work lunch spots. I don't recall if it was known as Mike's back then, but there was definitely a pizzeria at this location.I was in the neighborhood yesterday and stopped in for nostalgia's sake.Had two slices (round and square) and a beer.Typical NYC slices and the beer was cold.No complaints..The most dirty place you can find. Terrible customer service and food is disgusting. Waist of money"
"Usual subway, nice woman behind the counter. For your customers and your staff, you may want to turn on the air conditioning... It was like a tropical jungle in there....Super stingy woman there. Avoid her at all costs unless you want 3 spinach leaves on your sandwich. Trust, just go to another Subway. Horrible customer service..This Subway gets 5 stars for its location and 1 star for everything else. Believe me, this is a tough review to write because i am such a fan of Subways.  I love their sandwiches.  It always feels healthy.  I love the veggie options offered, and their 9 grain wheat bread.  I always get the chicken breast for a healthy option, and will occasionally splurge on the Philly cheesesteak when i am in a messy mood, and wanna be bad.  The reason for the low rating is because of the actual store itself and the staff inside.  I feel so bad for this particular location, and the owner that decided to open up here.  The rent must be very expensive because they keep renting space out and putting a fake wall so the store gets smaller and smaller.  How bad could the rent truly be on Queens Blvd?  I have no idea.  Soon there will be zero seats for eating indoors.  Additionally, the staff in here aren't fluent in English.  I don't have time for someone to mess up something so simple as a cold cut sandwich. Sad part is, all i do is point to the veggies and meats that i want.  No talking involved, and no need to master the English language on any level.  There is one woman in here (i think she is from Sri Lanka), and her English is hardcore limited.  She is always making international phones calls on her cellphone to relatives in India and just carrying on. I mean, just seriously unnecessary longwinded conversations.  Do your relatives really need to hear you gossip in India while you're on the job??  NO, i don't think so.  So unprofessional.  Every time she responds to me, she comes off rude and condescending with her facial expressions.  I wish here well.  I understand coming to America to chase the American dream and then wound up working at a fast food shop was not her definition of the ""American Dream"".  I understand she is disgruntled and bitter.  But damn, try to perform and put on your happy face till you win the mega millions..This Subway is the best spot in Sunnyside, there is a lady who works at night time and sometimes in the after who gives out free small drinks to any student 18 and below. She's kind and nice. For sure has the best customer service :).I love subway but this is the worst management and customer service with its nasty owner with no manners.She is so fake,and she is only nice when you pay her a lot.But when you want to take advantage of a desl or promo she either says they are not part of the promo or says she does not have it or makes you a very poor sandwichWhich she thinks when you buy it for cheaper you can not get the regular stuffed sandwich because she loses money.I bought two steak and cheese sandwiches online 2 for 10 $.She put very little steak, not even.cheese.She had s very nasty attitude because she was not making any money on me,and she did not mind showing me that she was not really happy to make my cheap sandwiches.I asked for some cheese, she put the cheese,she did not even ask what kind of cheese I want and did not even toast it.She put some onion even though I did not ask.She was preparing herself to wrap my sandwiches without asking for any vegetables and sauce.I said I want vegetables with my sandwich.She respond I should have told when ordering online even though there is no such option.She said those are not regular priced sandwiches and this is all I can get for a 5 dollar sandwich ,other than that she loses money she said.I know you and subway authorities are gonna read this.Shame on you that you are trying to rip off the customer because the deal that subway provided makes you thimk you lose money.so instead of you losing the money let the customer pay for it not you.You are embrassing yourself with your terrible attitude and poor work ethics.I believe subway wide take care of this business because she is doing imperfect job for sure.Hello, I am a long time customer from this spot. This is my favorite subway. I love the lady who works there she is so sweat and always asks how I am doing. So that's a good start for greetings. My sandwich orders always on point with accuracy and taste. I believe this the least you could expect from great service; always good greetings and accuracy with orders. So I decided to give you guys five stars you deserve it. Especially during these times. Stay safe and well, be there soon!!.Worst food ever, I ordered veggie patty sandwich and 3cookies. The bread is hard as stone, the veggie patty is hard as stone, the wrap paper is messy and disgusting. I said if no cookies, cancel this item, they just didn't deliver the cookies, but no refund. Most importantly, I was hungry and didn't want to waste $22 dollars for delivery this shit. I ate it. Then I had a serious stomachache, and had to eat pain relief. Later in the night, I got serious diarrhea. It was a nightmare! Don't order from them, save your life!.Weird service!!  Only one person handling everything at this Subways.  She kept asking me personal questions!  I just want to eat in peace and leave!  The pizza was Luke warm and stale.  It looked appetizing from the advertisement on the window.  I don't suggest it!   I won't be coming back.  So stingy with their napkins too!!.I actually liked the pizza I got from them yesterday. I had a little bbq sauce flavor pizza craving last night. Didn't want to order a whole pie from Pizza Hut and the local pizzeria doesn't seem like offer putting bbq sauce on pizza. I stumbled upon this subway joint and saw a pizza sign. I went in to try to find out what their personalized pizzas are all about. It was on the menu and only one lady was working. No one was in there so it felt a little odd but that was no big deal. She explained to me how the personalized pizza works and I got the one in the photo for about $5. To be honest, it was frozen pizza dough reheated in the oven but it was delicious and it helped with me sudden bbq flavor pizza craving, so I gotta give it some credit despite all the negative reviews..This is definitely the WORST Subway I have ever tried. The food quality here is unbelievable disgusting! Make me sick! So disappointed, as a long time Subway customer. Will NEVER ODER FROM HERE!"
"Love this Deli food and service is always great.  Breakfast sandwiches are the best in queens..Best breakfast sandwiches. The Sausage, egg and cheese is not to be played with!!! The family that owns the deli is so kind. Go here!.Whoever here said that they were nice people is greatly mistaken. I went in because Mrs. Chu made an appointment to see me regarding a business matter. I walked in prepared to order a breakfast sandwich and chat, but Mr. Chu immediately became hostile for no reason. I walked out disgusted with his attitude. I live up the street and will NEVER go back here..We love Frank! Best bacon egg cheese around! Best customer service & family owned. Support your local business!.Really nice people and great prices and tasty sandwiches, the only thing I dislike is that they close pretty early other than that it's a great little deli."
"One of the best Greek restaurants in New York City. The environment - and price range is upscale but the food is well worth the price! The bread basket with dips is extremely tasty. The restaurant has a big selection of international wines that you can accompany your meal with (including Assyrtiko and Vivliochora).Overall, we have always been extremely satisfied every single time we dine there. Pro tip: Thalassa usually offers Restaurant week menu, so make sure to check out their deals!.Wow, every dish was good!! It's expensive but it was a beautiful dining experience and the service was impeccable. We started off with the bread and it wa surprisingly soft! Then we had the lavraki tartare and octopus as appetizers and they were both good, but portions were pretty tiny for the price. I've never had lavraki tartare before so the white fish's color threw me off a bit. The octopus is also pretty soft and flavorful. Next up is our entrees. I got the seafood thalassina and wow, my jaw dropped. Yes, it seemed buttery so you can't really go wrong with that but this dish was not tiny and full of seafood flavor. Scallops, shrimps, mussels were all good! The two people I went with have been there many times and they both enjoyed their dishes as well. I'll definitely come back! After all, they're also a huge supporter of the nonprofit that I am a part of. Thalassa is awesome!.If the food is anything like the hostess that picked up the phone to assist with my reservation this evening then I'm assuming it taste as good as three day old prepackaged Greek food from Whole Foods..Such a nice experience at this restaurant!  Very nice environment - felt spacious and open. Our waiter was excellent which made all the difference.  Had some grilled calamari for an appetizer which was so tender and flavorful I would consider getting a double portion as my entree next time!  The fresh grilled fish was delicious.  Wanted to try the grilled king shrimp but the table near us got the last order.  Our waiter offered to substitute a large shrimp instead, and it was a great recommendation- the chef put a few extra on the plate and we ended up bringing several home to enjoy the next day.  They were cooked perfectly.  We had some spicy whipped feta dip with pitas for a starter, which was delicious - so that's what real pita bread tastes like!  Who knew!. We were much too full for dessert, but our waiter brought us a complimentary tasting of the baklava (which I never would have ordered because baklava is too sticky sweet for me).  Three little crisp slices which were so delicious and crisp without being sticky or gooey - and a nice hint of cinnamon to boot!  Really good - will be sure to order this next time!  What a little gem to find in our neighborhood - can't wait to try it again!.This restaurant is outstanding!! The way I found it is definitely out of the ordinary. I love Dover sole, and searched it, sure enough, Thalassa came up. It is a gorgeous place in the heart of Tribeca. Our server Gabrielle was outstanding. For our appetizer we had the grilled Portuguese Octopus... this was the best I have ever eaten. For the main coarse we shared the lamb shank & the Dover sole... the entire experience was amazing!!! I will be a regular   Came back again, this time I chose some different things. African King Shrimp, Calamari, had to have the Octopus & Dover Sole again. It was amazing!!.This restaurant is outstanding!! The way I found it is definitely out of the ordinary. I love Dover sole, and searched it, sure enough, Thalassa came up. It is a gorgeous place in the heart of Tribeca. Our server Gabrielle was outstanding. For our appetizer we had the grilled Portuguese Octopus... this was the best I have ever eaten. For the main coarse we shared the lamb shank & the Dover sole... the entire experience was amazing!!! I will be a regular here.Hubby and I were given a Pulsd voucher gift that we almost forgot and was about to expire the very same day so we decided to call in and was accommodated in an hour. I also realized that this place wasn't only in my Bookmarks but that I've been wanting to check it as a potential venue for both work and personal event, so was able to hit two birds in one stone last Friday. Upon entering, I was impressed by the overall design and vibe of the place. Really spacious too, had a second floor space and a wine cellar, on top of the regular space. Hostess was friendly and checked our coats right away then led us to a nice table. Gabriel, who's one of the Supervisors, also introduced himself and attended to us wonderfully throughout the night. For appetizers, hubby had the fish tacos which he said was delicious! And I had the grilled octopus which was so fresh, tender, and honestly the best that I've had. Perfectly executed! Gave my compliments to the Chef. For the main entree, I had the red snapper fillet and my husband had seabass. Both really satisfying! One thing that really made an impression on me is they have their fresh seafood on display and supposedly flown in from the Mediterranean. How amazing is that?As for dessert, I wouldn't have given in but since it was included, I couldn't resist even having 2 bites of their Panna Cotta with caramelized pear and berries. My goodness I wanted more but had to restrain myself. Husband had the baklava and got to enjoy the complimentary dessert tray that the Chef sent over. Lucky him.After I asked to see the upper space and wine cellar, I have already noted this as a potential venue. Not just for clients but for some personal events too. What won me over was not just the space, but more of the warm attentive service and fantastic food! Happy to have met their Executive Chef Ralpheal and was able to compliment him personally on how delicious everything was, especially the octopus! I'd be back just for that! :)Overall, such a great dining experience! Thanks for taking such good care of us! I believe we'll be back sooner! Cannot wait! :).My job has hosted their holiday party two times at Thalassa so far and they've never disappointed. When we entered we were greeted by the manager and staff and escorted to the coat check on the top floor. I must say I appreciate art and they truly have a great deal of landscape captures but I was told that's the norm for restaurants on that side of town. We entered the top level and the table setting and ambiance was beautiful. Low lights with stream lights on different sections of the top level. I mentioned their landscaping art on the first level, well on the top level there's so much more to see and they're all beautiful. The bar was where they catered appetizers and drinks. At every turn there was food and the bartender actually remembered our drinks after the 2nd visit. The appetizers were very good! Lamb, scallops, and other great combos. I was so full from the appetizer by the time I got to the dinner plate I was a stuffed potato. Everything was great! Food, service, and drinks. They may have to host for 2020..Great authentic Greek food, great service and great ambiance! Loved finding this Tribeca gem, will definitely be back soon.The Executive chef Ralpheal Abrahante made a complete fool of himself on the show Chopped,It was aired on12/15/2020. He is possibly the biggest egotisjerk I've ever seen on the show. Was never more happy when he was bounced in the first round after saying ""My Food Is Life Changing"" LOLOLOL. What a Tool....Top notch restaurant. Went for restaurant week and each of the courses delivered on every note.  Highly recommend, especially during restaurant week. Enjoyed the crudo, octopus, lamb, stuffed sea bass."
"It was my first time back since the start of the pandemic. Everything seemed pretty much the same including the price. It was good to see they are managing well.I had a Narraganset lager, and tasted an Old Fashion. They have a good bartender.I ordered a medium-rare, beef burger on a brioche roll with fried onions, mushrooms, and cheddar. It came medium, but it was nicely pink, and delicious. You can taste that it is grass-fed. The salad and the fries were good. The salad dressing was a bit solid, so it was hard to spread. The fries were seasoned, and normal sized. I was trying to remember if they were always like this, or had been thinner.The server was friendly, and the service good. The play pretty good music, and it is loud enough that a screaming toddler will go unnoticed.I missed the onion rings, but I have a few pandemic pounds to work off..tl;dr solid solid burger joint with great beef, bun of your choice (pretty rare option in my experience). The beef is slightly under-seasoned for even my asian palate but nothing a little salting at the table can't fix.I dig this spot because they're not afraid to let the quality of their meat shine. I don't taste any filler ingredients in the beef. I also like how you can choose your preferred patty doneness. I ordered the build-your-own burger and added the bacon which was still crispy by the time I brought it home.Their takeout process is also great! They keep the food in a insulated container until it's picked up so it stays nice and warm.I also ordered fries and tater tots, both of which were crispy and not overly seasoned!.Was craving burgers and a beer and found this place. It's a cute place with quick service. I'm giving it a three star because there wasn't a wow factor. The Buffalo wings were a good size and cooked well but they were crispy.. the pulled pork quesadilla was good but nothing special about it. Now to the burger, the bluemoon burger was good, but it was a bit bland. A side note the burgers do not come out soggy, so that's a plus. I hate a saggy bottom bun..I was sitting at a red light when I saw someone with a buffalo wing in their hands a couple weeks ago and I knew I had to try it. I looked the menu up really quick to see if I'd like to eat here and once I saw the photos of the burgers I decided to give it a try. My servers name was Noah and he is also the bartender. Pretty nice guy with a great attitude and demeanor. I was very happy with my wings and the turkey burger. There's an up charge for all the  toppings you add to your burger so add in moderation if your on the fence. They have outdoor or indoor dining and they are also checking your vaccination card here..The fours stars is for the lunch special, which is a great deal for $13.90: choice of several types of burgers (meat, black bean, turkey or chicken), fries or salad, and a fresh baked cookie.  The burger was quite good and came on a hefty brioche bun that didn't drip.  What I really loved is that multiple toppings were available for no additional charge.  For those who don't want to dine indoors, there is ample insulated & heated outdoor seating..Got delivery and it came quicker than expected and was very good. Burger was definitely mediumand tasted fresh. Chocolate chip cookie thrown in  was a nice touch. Will try dining in next time:).It smelled good is all I can say about this place. I don't know if this place is short staffed but after being seated and waiting for 10 mins, I never got a server to take my order even though clearly he saw me sitting there so I got up and left.I refuse to pay for shitty service so I'm taking my money elsewhere..End of August 2021...Covid is real; don't let them lie to you. Let's get into it.Some staff are wearing masks, they are checking vaccination cards (or excelsior passes) for indoor dining, limited seating indoors, a lot of outdoor seating. QR code menus in effect unless you ask for something different. 90 min seat limits.The server, who's name we did not catch, was a true gem. She was super helpful with menu questions, attentive without being intrusive, and overall a cool lady. There also was another woman at the front, who may have been the manager. She was dope too. One friend ordered two sliders, the pork belly and the pulled pork; ate them both without comment, lol. The other friend had the signature B&B burger as is with a side of skinny fries. She asked for aioli for her fries, and they did charge extra for that. I had the Pluckin Awesome sandwich without the cheese added an egg. I also had tater tots as my side. Tater tots were BOMB. Perfectly crisp and still a bit moist without being too greasy. The Pluckin Awesome was pretty good, but the egg was necessary for added moisture. Overall turkey burger was seasoned well. My only criticism is that the bread was a little dry. This hurt my heart because it is brioche! It was almost like the buns had been left out all day. I think my friend thought the same thing because I noticed she broke off a few pieces...like a bird.The vibe of B&B is chill. They have a wide selection of drinks, so it seems like a nice place for a low key date night or the girl's night we had. The area seems like it gets poppin because there are quite a few bars and restaurants on that part of 5th Ave..My friend and I had a great experience here. The food, service, and atmosphere were wonderful. Classy casual (if that's a thing) is how I'd describe it. Sports on the televisions, but not a rowdy sports bar. Of course, it was a very cold Tuesday night in the middle of January, so maybe it gets more animated during popular sports games. Also, our vax cards and ID were checked at the door- thank you!.Solid vegan menu! But no vegan appetizers except for salad which is BORING. And no vegan deserts as well. Lots of outdoor seating with heaters but only 5 tables for indoor seating with divisions. Thank God we were seated inside because it was cold when we went there and we see people seating outside still cold and with jackets on even with heat on their booths. So I think those heaters are useless. Customized my burger and they accidentally put the v&b sauce which is not so good for my taste. Everything is extra fee so my burger and fries came up to $21. Decent serving but I wish it's bigger coz I have a big appetite. We were a party of 4 and we didn't wait to get seated.. no reservations. May I suggest chips and guacamole for vegan apps please and not just salad."
"Our grandchild visiting from MA had specifically asked us to go to a vegetarian Indian restaurant, and we found Pongal first just by walking past one day, and then looking it up on yelp!  We loved that they followed to the letter asking for vaccine verification and ID, so we felt reasonably comfortable eating in (not that there was an eating outdoor option, lol).  Had an excellent experience, both food and service.  Three starters: mulligatawny soup, steaming hot which was so appreciated on this cold, windy evening; idli (apparently usually 2 per serving but the woman - owner? manager? - asked if we would like to have 3 and we did); and samosas (same number).  They were so good!  Never had large idli like those, totally bland and perfect for dipping into the little cup of sambar (soupy lentil stew) or the coconut chutney.  The samosas were really good, bigger and with more filling than we usually find, and really good dipped into either the spicier green sauce or the tamarind (?) chutney served with.Our entrees were: aloo gobi for my husband who doesn't tolerate spicy food, and this he pronounced very good, served with rice; teen had baingan bhartha (eggplant) w rice also and really liked it a lot; I tried something different, a mixed veg utthapam.  This was a lightly fried pancake with peas, tomatoes, carrots and sambar and a chutney.  Three very satisfying appetizers and 3 delicious mains, and we were quite full!  But put a dessert menu in front of me and all bets are off, lol!  We let the teen choose, and they chose something called Shrikhand, which was a yogurt-based (I think) pudding with cardamom, saffron, and some chopped pistachios.  Mmmmm!  Creamy and smooth but not too rich, we shared 1 order with 3 spoons.  We had plenty of fuel to walk the 30 or so blocks home!We really enjoyed the entire meal and expect that we'll be eating at Pongal again even without our grandchild!.We were looking to have some authentic South Indian food and we came across this restaurant. We tried both the Madras thali and Pongal.Madras thali:The Poori and the curry for it was very good. Pappadam isn't usually the most authentic addition, I would have liked just the regular rice appalam. Also the quantity of white rice for the thali was just too less ! The tamarind rice again wasn't authentic. The sambar and rasam was pretty decent. The next dish we wanted to have was Sweet pongal and unfortunately they did not have it :( That was disappointing considering that was the name of the restaurant lol! so we ended up getting the spicy Pongal. But that was good .. so that was a good thing !! :D Also i would recommend you to try the buttermilk on a hot sunny day! :DOverall cannot say it the food felt very South Indian but sure is a decent place to try !.I'll start out by noting that I've only ordered delivery from Pongal. I usually get the mysore masala dosa which comes with two chutneys and sambar. I also normally get an order of idli and vada. They pack the dosa and the masala separately, which I actually really like because otherwise, the dosa gets even soggier than normal. Of course, if you get a dosa delivered, you lost out on its crispiness, so be prepared for that if you get it delivered. The mysore dosa is not particularly spicy, and the aloo masala is very good, but could also use more spice. The sambar is full of flavor and vegetables, but very thin. I really like both the chunteys as well. Idli and vada are both good, too. On that note, when I recently ordered delivery, they forgot to add my vada, so I only got one idli, although I had ordered one idli and one vada. It took some time to explain the situation to them, but ultimately, they generously told me they'd give me an extra one on my next order, which is nice. I'll update the review if they honor that promise, but it's a nice gesture nonetheless..Great hospitality, and highly authentic dosa and chaats available here. Cannot wait to try the rest of their menu!Definitely my go-to spot for Mysore Rava Dosa and Chaat moving forward!.I typically rarely go to Indian restaurants being an Indian myself and already eat our cuisine at home frequently. Though I was also with family in New York and they typically still like Indian food when going out as well. This restaurant was very small. And there was very little space in between tables Plus not a lot of legroom. Because if I chose to scoot my chair out I would be in the aisle way of the entrance. I expected there to be more distance when masks were required in New York. Overall the food was good. Especially the chutney because you can rarely find restaurants that use fresh coconut..Up till last night, I considered Pongal to be one of the best restaurants in New York.... Not anymore. I can not say enough bad about this place. We have ordered delivery from here about fifteen times, and it was always very good and very spicy - but to protect our health we will never order from here again. Last night the food was very very salty. Neither my partner nor I have ever had food that tasted that salty in our lives. In large quantities salt is dangerous. My blood pressure was elevated, we both had extreme vertigo and also edema. Still working to flush the salt out.These restaurants always have some excuse for these kind of problems. I am sure Pongal will not accept any responsibility for this complete failure. Maybe a new chef...? I don't know and I don't care. I will never give them another dollar and risk my health with this very unhealthy food. I think it is time for me to take a break from Indian food for a few years. Either it is too oily, too sweet, too salty, or not spicy enough. Restaurants need to have consistency above all else, if they can't master that, get out of the business..My girlfriend insisted that we give this place another shot. There was some improvement, but I will keep it at two stars, till I see if the improvement stays.Got delivery, really bad Chana Chaat - tasted like nothing - like canned chickpeas smothered in Danon yogurt, tasteless. Yuck. Tasted Middle-Eastern not Indian!Also, Madras Rava Masala Dosa was just alright, certainly nowhere near hot/spicy enough. She got Madras Rava, she liked. I loved that the dosas were still crispy (most delivered dosas are soggy). The Sanbar was very hot, a plus, but was too creamy at the bottom. Will try again soon. Do need to get the heat up..A complete waste of time and money. While the last order from here was almost hot enough, this was a joke. OK Indian Dudes, I am a white American and I know way way more about how your food should be prepared. I am going to start offering classes. Mild is never right - never right! I got sick from this food because it was so mild. The sambar is the worst on the planet, creamy and not hot at all. What a joke. Without a doubt I will never give the Mild Child - Pongal another try..Well, after a year and a half, I decided to give Pongal another try. Simple enough, got two dosas from there, a Madras Rava Masala Dosa and a Madrass Rava Dosa. While they weren't quite hot enough, they only missed the mark by 30% and the dosas were very good and very crisp. There was also a very substantial portion of Sambar. We also ordered the Bisibelebath Weekend Special, and it was really good. Again to get higher than three stars they would have had to have made it truly hot enough. Sad note: Of all the restauranteurs in New York, who deal in Hot?Spicy food, the Indians have the least backbone. Almost any run-of-the-mill Mexican, Tex-Mex, Thai, Szechuan, Jamaican or Korean place is hotter. Some Italian restaurants serve hotter food. What is WRONG with the Indian population of New York. Guys - you should be so humiliated and disgraced by the weakness of the Indian food in New York..This used to be one of my favorite South Indian places in the city, but not anymore. They are unable to make the food spicy enough for me anymore, maybe a new owner?  It is stuck at very mild, even when you ask for HOT! Recently they actually told me that the chef (if that's what he is) said he could not make the food any spicier. So that was my last visit.Also, it seems as if most of the staff is not from India, I asked them..I had an amazing dining experience here. We ordered the cheese masala dosa and a thali platter for two people. Everything was delicious and fresh and the prices were reasonable ! Highly recommend ordering the masala tea to start your meal..Actually some of the BEST Indian food i've had in the city. I have tried soo many different spots for dosas but this place, this place is IT! The dosa was perfectly flavored & fresh. I highly recommend the cheese spring dosa..I enjoyed my lunch at Pongal. I decided to come here because a friend had recommended it. So far it is my favorite South Indian restaurant in NY. I had their chef's lunch special, which came with a dosa, an idli, a medu vada, sambhar, coconut chutney and red chutney. The service was good. I was seated quickly and my food came out promptly. Whenever I needed a server (to order the check, or if I had a question), there was always someone nearby. The food was also good. The vada wasn't too spicy, the idli was pillow-soft and the dosa had the perfect proportion of crispy parts to soft parts. All three if these tasted very good, and I could not have asked for them to be made better. Hats off to the chef. However, the coconut chutney and the tomato sauce, although good, did not particularly leave an impression, and the sambhar was a bit spicy for my taste (although it was not unbearably spicy). I really enjoyed the Badam milk, though. It was perfect: just enough crushed almonds inside, not too sweet (just the way I like it) and not too large in size.I really enjoyed my lunch overall and would come back here..11/10. Sooooo amazing. Ordered #96 and eggplant dish #72... couldn't be happier right now. If you love Indian food as much as I do, do yourself a favor and try Pongal!"
"Food was good.Ordered pizza,salad and lasagna .They were all good & so was the service ..I hadn't been here in years. During the pandemic we ordered in once and I wasn't thrilled, but take out is always a let down. We decided to eat in here on a weds pm after a wake. We were seated very quickly. We ordered and our appetizer came out very quickly. But then it went down hill from that point on.  The service was bad. We were waiting forever for our entree. We even got the attention of our server. We asked her to check on it. She went in the kitchen, then avoided us for a good 10-15 mins and finally said your food should be out shortly. Then it had to be another 10 mins. We ordered the fried zucchini flowers which I am pretty sure, said it had some truffle oil. Well there was NO truffle flavor whatsoever. They were fried ricotta. Too heavy. Then I ordered the veal Osso Bucco it was good. I requested to substitute the risotto for Brussel sprouts. My husband had the ahi tuna special. He said it was ok. If you ask me, it didn't look appetizing..I used to love this place and used to recommend to all my family and friends but NOT ANYMORE. There is ZERO customer service here. The girl who took my delivery order on the phone tonight 2/10/22 was the most rude person I've ever spoken to in the restaurant industry.My first call, she yelled at me because my dog was barking in the background and she complained that it was too loud. I apologized. The next call, I asked if I could pay with a card and she answered me very sarcastically that she doesn't know if the card machine worked. So I said ok I'll just pay cash and asked how much was the total so I can make sure I had enough to tip the driver too. She asked me what I ordered so I repeated it to her, but she instead proceeds to make a 2nd order. I clarified that I didn't need a new order, I just needed to know how much I owed. She then mumbled something and hung up on me! I called again and told her to stop giving me attitude, I just wanted to ask a simple question. Then she hangs up on me AGAIN! On my final call I asked her to please not hang up and she answered me that she did not like that I told her that she had an attitude (which she definitely absolutely had). She did not even apologize once. I think she forgot that she works in customer service.The pizza here is good, one of the best in the area. But the staff seems like they can't be bothered to treat customers nicely. I'd rather go somewhere else than be treated like that. Go to Patsy's or Emilio's instead, where the pizza is good too and everyone is friendly..Family dinner! Nice decor. Fast Good food. Street parking. Penne with broccoli rabe was good. Large serving of chicken parmigiana was shared. Customer service could be improved. They were fast and attentive but maybe too fast since we weren't quite finished and they wanted to take our plates..Food was delicious staff was fun and friendly. They did excellent with our very large party. Atmosphere is beautiful I would definitely recommend..Order the express lunch baked ziti. It was a huge portion. I was hoping there would be meat in there but it was just the pasta sauce and cheese. Nevertheless, it was tasty and good for the price. Garlic bread was yummy as well.Ordered for pick up!I really like the Margherita pizza's crust; it has the right amount of char. The tomato sauce isn't too overpowering or tart (which I prefer) and there's just the right amount of ingredients. The chicken parmigiana is another one of my go-to dishes from Patricias. The CHEESE gets nicely melted. I grew up in Morris Park and Patricias has been around for such a long time. I've also eaten in the restaurant and did take out quite a few times and would definitely eat here over other Italian choices in the area. Service is great and the ambiance of the restaurant is intimate. Cute date spot!.I tried their - Sicilian pizza - plum fresh tomato sauce. This was delish and the base was perfectly cooked in a brick over. Not pictured but also tried their gnocchi sorrentina. I did like the fresh tomato sauce but the gnocchi itself was over cooked unfortunately. Anyways, their portion size is huge and it was a good delivery option..It's been a year since I was here. It is so strange to see half the seats removed and the bar stools gone. They are doing everything they can to protect their patrons. Great pizza and cold Peroni beers. Leftover Pizza was even better the second day. Don't forget that wonderful oil with garlic and hot pepper flakes for Tarranova bread dipping. Support this restaurant!.Celebrating a family event for 11 people on a recent Saturday night. Patricia's staff couldn't have been more helpful. Used RESY and a phone call for the reservation. BTW - more than 12 people requires a simple contract with a cancellation charge per plate if you don't show. Very fair.Great restaurant- so full of life, families and singles enjoying a great meal, like being at your Italian grandma for Sunday supper. Started with family style apps: Napolitana pizza with broccoli rabe, Lemon Shrimp salad with white beans, excellent spicy calamari arrabbiata, spiedini alla romana and great complimentary tarranova bread with spicy EVVO with plenty of garlic. Entrees includes 8 different large portion pastas cooked al dente ( few places know how to get that perfect chew feeling when you bite down like you get in Italy) shrimp scampi and a large veal Osso Buco ($32) and tender veal Marsala. Clean plates for everyone with only a few left overs brought home.Six bottles of wine and Prosecco - all excellent with the Louis Martini 2016 Cabernet at $40 and the Frogs leap Chard ($50) being the most expensive. Once home, I Looked up all the wines on line and they were 2.0 to 2.5 times retail. Not bad. A few craft-beers ($7 each)for the meat eaters were ice cold. They served up our celebration cake nicely and right on time. Johnny are dedicated server was wonderful and we did not feel rushed at all. 20% gratuity added in due to the size of the party-  however, with such a large party I hoped for a complimentary bottle of house wine or a plate of dessert cookies/biscotti. Just say-in..We love Patricia's and have been there almost a dozen times. Last night, I had a huge Veal Chop Valdostano ($34) stuffed with provolone cheese and prosciutto in a demi glace sauce with browned fingerling potatoes. It was tender - like you could cut it with a fork. The sauce was great for dipping that fresh Taranova bread. My wife had the Rigatoni Pavarotti with broccoli rabe, chicken and mushrooms.($21). Cooked perfectly. However, the Scallops Casino Special appetizer was served in 4 huge scallop shells - it looked and smelled delicious, the garlic breadcrumbs were tasty, but where were the scallop pieces? Very few found. It was not worth the $21 charge.  Reasonable priced drinks: Peroni in a chilled glass: $7, nice sized Grey Goose Martini, $13, and a nice sized glass of very good house Cabernet: $12.  However, our dining experience was cut short without dessert and coffee and the sambuca (I love) because the restaurant was freezing - Not just this restaurant, but all places should keep the temp at 72. All in all we had a great time and paid $50 less for the meal than the nice restaurant we frequented the night before..We love Patricia's - eating there is like a Sunday dinner at your Italian Grandma's house. Everyone is smiling and laughing - all ages, eating perfectly cooked Italian food. A little noisy maybe, but the food combined with the people watching and the spot-on service make for a great experience. We started with a perfectly made Grey Goose martini and a Peroni along with the Authur Ave Tarranova bread with a spicy garlic olive oil for dipping. The Baccala Salad special appetizer was delcious as were the stuffed fried Zucchini flowers (BTW - where do you find Zucchini flowers in December??).The entree of Rabbit Lasagne with Béchamel sauce was a very unusual dish and the kitchen pulled it off - it tasted great. The Langostino black ink pasta was perfectly cooked (like all Patricia's pasta) with clams in a spicy red sauce.  It was also very unusual, but it lacked spice and the squat little lobster meat was very hard to get out of the shells. It would have been better if the chef had pulled the meat out and put it in the pasta. Biscotti and coffee were great. Can't wait to return..This is my second time coming here and it was just as good as the first time. The atmosphere was just as great as the food. The appetizers hit the table and was gone in an instant. The mozzarella in the antipasto was fresh. The prosciutto complimented everything else on the dish. I'm very skeptical when it comes to oysters but it was delicious. No sand or grit and tasty. The black spaghetti ,not only looked aesthetically appealing, it tasted great, not too heavy, had a spicy zing to it and was all around a good dish. The pizza....omg the pizza?! I'd sell my children(doesn't have kids) to have an endless supply. So rich, not too greasy and full of flavor. I'll definitely will be coming back!!"
"The Nova lox bagel sandwich + tomatoes + capers + onions on a cheddar bagel with scallion cream cheese is my go to whenever I fly out of PDX. Sure it's $16+ but you're at the airport...everything's over priced anyways so might as well make it worth it!!Workers at the counter are always SUPER nice and friendly as well!!!.Kenny and Zuke's carries a number of Portland favorites (Olympia Provisions rillettes, marionberry jam, Aadvark hot sauce) that you can conveniently pick up before your flight home. It's great.Out of convenience, I also decided to grab a quick dinner here. Based on the menu selection, I chose the Pastrami Lover's Dream, which apparently is a favorite. It comes with beef and turkey pastrami, swiss cheese, bacon, and Russian dressing on rye bread. How much did it cost?! Fucking nearly $16 dollars for a pint size sandwich!! Holy moly! Money side and taste buds in the mix, I can safely say that the sandwich left severely parched. Too much sodium. No sanks.It's alright here. Pick up goodies but mosey elsewhere for food..Cheesy steak sandwiches had very little cheese to the point the flavor profile really should not claim cheese. Pressed sandwich with grainy mustard and thin sliced steak. Greek salad wasn't bad but not great. Service was good, my questions were answered to satisfaction, and the sandwiches made in a timely manner..The food just wasn't very good. There are definitely better dining options at PDX Airport. Kenny & Zuke's has a prime central location between terminals A & C after one of the TSA checkpoint. It's half a grab-n-go market and half a quick food restaurant. I tried the Portland Cheesesteak Sandwich with sliced Beef, Mushrooms, Onions, and Cheese served warm Panini-style. It was bitter and bland at the same time. Neither flavor made me want to finish the flat hoagie. So, I didn't. Kenny & Zuke's Delicatessen & Market at the Portland airport is open early at 4:00 a.m. until late 11:00 p.m. Even if it is open, I'd still probably head down terminal C looking for better options if time permits before my flight..5am @ March 4th, 2020: somebody give these ladies a raise for having an absurd amount of cheer and humor while I'm feeling like a zombie. Brightened my day for sure! Breakfast bagel egg and cheese sandwich was expensive (~$8) but hit the spot perfectly. Can't speak for any of the other menu items..I didn't have much time to spend in Portland and was fortunate enough to stumble upon their airport location.So their sando is pretty decent.  The meat is tasty from the seasoning, etc.  With regard to texture, the cut of the meat is more towards shaved/sliced thin like Togo's as opposed to the thick and juicy/fatty NY and LA standards like Katz's, Langer's, etc.  It's a bit drier too though Togo's is a bit juicier.  The Russian dressing does help a bit!Not sure if I would give this location another chance but I do look forward to trying one of their more traditional locations..Each time I travel through PDX, I'm impressed with another local business that has taken up residence at the Airport, and at in-town prices.  The original Kenny & Zukes is in the Pearl District, not far from Powell's Books and on the same block as the Ace Hotel and Stumptown Coffee. The PDX outpost is right in front of you as you emerge from Terminal A/B/C side Security, and next to the new Stumptown location. I enjoyed lunch here, which at the counter offers huge paninis and other huge delicious deli sandwiches. You can take your meal to your gate, or sit at their bar like I did with a Portland Craft Brew. If you're in a bit of a hurry, smaller sandwiches are available to go, along with mustard and other condiments for gift or self-catering purposes. Service was friendly and helpful at all 3 purchase points that I visited..What a pleasure to find an airport restaurant that offers quality sandwiches & Bagels.  It's a little pricy but the service was fast and friendly and their Reuben sandwich was excellent!      5 stars for the sandwich but 4 stars over all for costing $20....Looking for a quick Breakfast option at the airport. If you have less than 30 min before your boarding, need something grab and go but I wanted more than just muffin or snack bar.  K&Z had egg, cheese bagel and that was perfect. Hope I could choose my cheese (not big cheddar fan), but came with two stack of fried eggs(!). Coffee tasted a bit weak, should have gotten from next door (but there was a huge line...) yes, a bit much $ for bagel sandwich but convenience at the airport and served my purpose for today..Wow, the BEST breakfast sandwich I've ever had!!  The Big Shot is devine!!  Airport food can be tough but this was top notch. Sat at the bar and ate while watching the runway."
"Always ask the chef what to order if you can. He recommended I order the gyro and it didn't disappoint. The staff was really friendly and provided good service from start to finish. I am giving a good review because it was a good experience but I do want to make it clear thatTHIS IS AIRPORT FOOD. Because it was made with care for the customer and my overall experience is good thats why I am leaving this review as a compliment to the staff. One thing I would suggest is toasting the bread on the pita because the sandwich was a bit softer than I would like but, it was still good. Thank you again to the staff for taking care of me..I'd have passed but too few options around.This is ""street food"" but man, you may have to LIVE on the streets to afford what they are selling.  I know it's in an airport AND it's New York but man, $19 is a bit rich for a chicken sandwich.  The sauce was good but it was a pre-cook, dipped, topped with slaw and put on a bun. Handful of school cafeteria fries and served on a small tray.Seated fast and food was quickly brought out (pre-cooked) but took too long to get paid out.....Two stars for the taste but that was more of a 12-13 meal....I feel robbed on that street..whyyy does this restaurant serve nothing but pork for breakfast?! c'mon!! it's 2022!!!.Not bad for airport food... We shared the pulled pork nachos which had a good kick. At $15 they're a little pricey but definitely enough for two people to share. Not a bad option in the Delta terminal..Was hungry at the airport before departure and decided to stop and eat real quick as well as grab a drink. Probably took about 10 minutes before I was even noticed and then given a menu. I got the bahn mi but they didn't have any cilantro...and the cucumbers were cut in big chunks. The sauce wasn't right and the pulled pork dominated most of the sandwich which is not what a real bahn mi is. Probably shouldn't have expected much from a restaurant in the airport. I couldn't even finish 1/4 of my meal..For an airport restaurant, this wasn't bad. The service was pretty fast, it seemed clean, and my meal was a large portion and tasted fine. Nothing to write home about, but it was decent! The breakfast menu is very small - only four entree options. There isn't a lot restaurant options in this terminal, though, so it's better than nothing!.I landed in JFK for a layover on a recent trip to the East Coast. Since it was right smack in the middle of lunch time, I chose to get lunch at the nearest restaurant at my terminal and that was none other than Urban Crave. Urban Crave menu offerings consisted of various burgers and sandwiches. As typical of airport food, the prices are menu. Burgers are $20 and the sandwiches are $16. I chose to get a Bahn Mi sandwich for $16. All of their sandwiches come with house made chips or for an extra fee (no surprise there with the extra fee) you can get fries.The bahn mi was ok but definitely not something to write home about. The bread was rather hard and there was not too much chicken in there. Flavorwise it was alright but a little on the spicy side. The house made chips were a little on the bland side. Overall the food here is not quite something I would crave for but do-able for a small layover..A totally unnecessary ignorance by a bartender who saw me standing by the bar to purchase couple salads but she would find any reason and other things to do but not to assist me. Left to the store right in front and was assisted right away!.So we get to the airport a little early Gate B 47 after a 45 minute walk to the terminal we were looking for  somewhere to plant and have a drink and a bite to eat the only place in site was called urban crave. 4 hrs later eating almost everything on the menu and every cocktail you can think of . I am so happy we waited and did not stop at the other hundred places we passed to get here . Great place !!! Our first Waitress Jean was incredible as well as Jamie . Can't wait to fly again ..The staff is all over the place and ordering their quick to go food seems like it could have a better process.Good tomato soup and grilled cheese!"
"- shredded chicken taco was AMAZING!- chicken salad was delicious  Ask for a sample, they will hook it up- three tacos is filling  I didn't even get to eat my pastor yet - good horchata - friendly patient cash register man  He was patient enough to explain everything on menu.Food: 4/5Ordered chicken tacos, chicken quesadillas and chips/guacamole for delivery. I didn't get to try the chicken tacos but the chicken quesadilla was pretty darn good. They packed it with a very generous amount of chicken. Also, the guacamole was very fresh and refreshing. It's a must try!We ordered through DoorDash. Delivery took a very long time but this isn't a reflection on the establishment. I think we got a slow driver..Taquerias are single-handedly one of the best things ever, and I'm so glad they're all over Bushwick! :)I ordered the veggie avocado burrito, and it was so filling. The burrito was MASSIVE. It had red and green bell peppers, tomatoes, squash and avocados. It was also filled with beans, rice, pico de gallo, cheese and sour cream. The burrito came out to around $12, which is a little bit higher in price point. However, this is New York after all.I didn't take a picture of the inside of the burrito, because trust me, it didn't look appetizing. I promise it was delicious though! Definitely ask for the green and avocado sauce! Both aren't spicy, but they add extra flavor. The cashier was super nice. The service was great. Nothing fancy for a taqueria. The prep time is a but longer, but I wanted to note that there was only one chef. So, you have to be patient, because it's truly out of everyone's control. I would still recommend this place, though..** Delivery Review**Placed an order here on a Friday evening through Uber Eats. Good selection of your regular Mexican fare with only a small deliver feeBetween two people, ordered the Veggie Avocado Burrito ($15.50), Alambre Tepito Nachos ($16.25), and a pair of Campechano Tacos ($10.50). Definitely pricier than other similar spots, but was hopeful on the quality of the food. Order arrives within the delivery window, thankfully still warm enough to not reheat. First off, the nachos are fantastic - a dense layering of chips, cheese, guac, sour cream, salsa, and every meat imaginable. One of the few times where the chips made up the least amount of the dish. As for the tacos, saltier than I would have liked, and the tortillas were stale. On a positive note, the ingredients are generous and the extra sauce on the side balanced out the flavors.Again considering the price, wouldn't order here as often. Would like to try in person at some point..Our favorite chicken quesadillas so far in the tri state area and the guacamole sauce is the best!.Food is delicious.  Food  always arrives before estimated time!!!!Their Tortas and Quesadillas. Are amazing..Yesterday's lunch treat was Taqueria Santa Fe! Quesadillas and tacos from Taqueria Santa Fe  so good!!! The children soup is delicious and will warm you up in these cold days! Cheerio!.I found this place here on Yelp. I had guests coming over for dinner and we all settled for Mexican. I ordered takeout and everything was well prepared and delicious! Chipotle tacos, chipotle chicken soup, traditional pork tacos, chorizo nachos and steak fajitas!  All of it delicious !!! We ordered the cucumber water that they prepare daily!Service is quick and sufficient..This spot is quick and delicious. I ordered for pick up and it was ready shortly after. My favorite thing I got here was the alambre tepoto nachos, which had a mixture of different meats. The chips were so delicious and I could tell it was freshly made. They were also very generous with the toppings on it. However, the chicken Tingas tacos were a little dry. The chicken seemed to be over cooked and I had to fill it with sour cream. The grilled steak tacos were better. I got the taco platter which was a great deal because tacos are way cheaper this way. I would definitely come back to this place..One of the best Mexican restaurants in the neighborhood.The food is fresh and so tasty. This is my to go place for tacos! The stuff is also very welcoming..Everything about this restaurant was great. The place was clean and smelled good. The staff and greeter was very nice. Our waiter was awesome, the staff also worked as a team in bringing and cleaning up our food. The food was fresh and awesome. Then we also had dessert and that was really good as well. Great atmosphere with really nice people."
"I LOVE this placeThis is mine and my husbands go-to!! I swear if they had a reward system we probably would have racked a billion points by nowWe love this take out spot both chinese and sushi never disappoint.Decided to try a new item... chicken panang curry and OMFG probably more tastier and authentic than some thai spots.This has become my go to take out / fast delivery Chinese food.The prices are super cheap, the menu is great, and the delivery is super fast. The delivery guys are so nice!I always get the crab rangoons, the boneless BBQ ribs, and a pork egg roll. Sometimes I add in beef and broccoli or chicken and broccoli, but lately I've been ordering the string beans and beef or string beans and pork. The food comes hot, fresh, and tastes delicious!.I tried this place on a recommendation from a friend who likes their food, and usually their delivery times are super. I used the yelp app to order online for delivery. The food prices are pretty reasonable. The delivery time said 60 minutes, which I thought was a bit long, however, the food arrived in about 30 minutes. I had my usual cream cheese wontons which were hot and fresh, super cheesy. I also tried the beef and broccoli, which had a bit too much sauce, and not nearly enough broccoli, and what broccoli was there was super hard and crunchy, not really even cooked. The beef was good though. In addition we tried the boneless beef ribs which were actually better than other places in the area, the beef was moist, with just the right amount of crisp, and the sauce wasn't too oily. Woohoo! If they can maintain their delivery times, this will be my new go to chinese place..Best place to order out or delivery, nothing in sheepshead bay compared to their quality, prices and offers. Every at home party comes out to an Asian bay party tray or roll platter. If we order in, there isn't a single other option I would consider, and I've tested all other sushi places for delivery. You'll get the best bang, the freshest fish and great service. Even their Chinese menu is better than the Chinese delivery around, it's convenient when someone in your group doesn't eat sushi. I love their wonton soup, BTW . They use the Japanese wontons rather than those thick ones all other Chinese restaurants use. I'm ordering tomorrow, special roll party tray. I'll take pics this time, and post!.Good sushi, meh Chinese food. Got takeout for a family shindig and we had a few sushi platters which were great, and a bunch of Chinese dishes which were mediocre. Scallion pancakes were good though. The sushi was fresh and not overly packed with rice. Prices are fine, it's pretty no frills but for causal sushi it's good..Great Americanized-Chinese take out. We ordered Large Sesame Chicken, Small Chicken Curry, and Garlic Wings with fries.Everything was tasty and fresh! Great prices..Very quick service, surprisingly consistent, probably a bit unhealthy, but freaking damn good!Asian Bay has been my go to cheat lunch meal whenever I have been in need of a quick, inexpensive, tasty meal in the neighborhood. Yes, I said tasty and am not ashamed to say so. When something taste good, it just taste good! I can't count the number of times I have been to Asian Bay over the years. It was my first destination in the area for ""bootleg"" Chinese food, but for a certain time period the quality deteriorated and the way they cooked the Egg Foo Young and Szechuan, Hunan and Garlic sauce dishes changed. However, I am glad to report that over the last year they seemed to have changed back to the way they used to make those dishes.I've had more than my fair share of lunch specials over time here - Chicken Egg Foo Young, Roast Pork Egg Foo Young, Chicken with Mixed Vegetables, Hunan Chicken, Szechuan Chicken, Chicken with Garlic Sauce, Sesame Chicken, Szechuan Beef, Beef with Garlic Sauce. All with fried rice and a soup (Wonton or Egg Drop). All of them are good and inexpensive, typically running from $6-$6.50 for the lunch special nowadays in 2019. The portions are fare as well and will fill anyone up, especially if you add the free soup.As for my favorites? The Szechuan, Hunan or Garlic Sauce with chicken or beef dishes are crack. My belt line has still not forgiven me for the number of times I have come here for any of those dishes for lunch special. There is always an abundance of sauce in those dishes and when mixed with the fried rice --- cheat meal perfection. I love the Egg Foo Young dishes too as they typically come with 3 huge pieces and plenty of sauce goodness. If you're ordering a lunch special, it'll come with a soup or soda. I say save your sugar levels for desserts and skip the soda. Get yourself a soup to complete your meal, preferably the Egg Drop or Wonton, which is served with 3 huge wontons.Now, the one thing people tend to be hesitant about for small Chinese fast food restaurants like this are the sanitary conditions and for good reason because many of these type of restaurants really don't take care of their establishments. But, I've never gotten sick from eating here and the place looks fairly ""clean"" on top of the A rating they have from the NYC Department of Health. In addition, the women working the register are always friendly, so I've never had issues with them.Whether it's defined as ""Chinese"" food or not, I really don't care, the bottom line is that it taste good and fills my belly right. Yes, I'm Chinese and it's typically shameful to eat at places like this for people of my ethnicity instead of ""real"" Chinese restaurants, but I'm not going to eat something I don't like somewhere that serves ""real"" Chinese food. Who cares where it's from? Right? If the place is clean and the food is good, I'm there, and I'll be continuing my once in a while cheat meal trips to Asian Bay because it's damn well delicious. BAM..Even though the order was good. Delivery person texted me FU when I didn't answer his call. Will never order from here again. When I asked for an apology they laughed. Then called me back with a laugh apology. Terrible service. Will never order again. And they sounded they are ok with it. Laughed as they made the delivery person apologize. Straight up heard everyone laughing as they said delivery person didn't speak English..My wife and I sat down for a meal and afterwards, she went back before I could ask her for another time!.     It was a very enjoyable evening     Everything was wonderful.Ordered from here and we believe that this place is under new management. The food is bland, no taste. Very weird..Don't even try Bad food super long delivery Never again There is better options out there and cheaper Small order takes like 2 hours Unbelievable"
"This place and meal was recommended to me and there is not a single complaint to be made. The food was so flavorful, portion generous and price decent. I highly suggest you try the Waakye with fried fish because that was the highlight of the dish for me. This cost me $16 and lasted me two days . The lady I met when I picked it up was really nice and recommended I try the fufu and okro next time I order. I can't wait to try it!Tip: Call ahead of time and bring cash with you.The first couple times I walked into Akwaaba I didnt order anything. I was kind of shook lol, it didnt seem like a restaurant; theres no menu, no pictures of food, and like 2 tables (Its definitely a take out only place). However they have an A food rating so eventually I just bit the bullet and ordered something. Its amazing honestly lol. The food especially the jollof is just so damn good. The fried fish and fried beef are so really good. The meat to rice ratio is way off but considering everything taste so good I live with it. Most meals there will run you $15 (fried fish, sautéed peppers onions & carrots, w/ jollof rice), some as much as $20 (fried beef, sautéed peppers onions, and carrot, jollof rice, & plantain). The owners are friendly but sort of cater to people already familiar with the food. They dont make much of an effort to explain the dishes. You kind of have to go there knowing what you want to order and once that conversation gets going they'll explain what theyve got that day. If you dont have any friends that can put you on I recommend starting with jollof and fish or beef and then just asking questions and paying attention to what other people order. Its some of the best west African food I've had. Its definitely a hidden gem and worth a visit..We wanted to support as much as we could during these hard times. So we went to different restaurants around the neighborhood to give it a try. Definitely was an experience to walk into this really dark restaurant that was covered up and didn't have a light on. The light was through a crack in the curtain, what an experience. There's no menu, you're greeted by the friendly person in the front asking what do you like ? We were like surprise us, then there were different cooking style. He can tell it was our first time, so we let him surprise is. I really enjoyed the experience and love the jollof rice..Well. It is my first time eating at this restaurant. I enjoyed it. I have been craving Ghanaian food for weeks... specifically banku and okro stew... so the verdict. I believe it is good. Pepper perfect. The only thing is I do not like my meat too chewy.  So I gave 4 stars (most African like it chewy) Pressure cook the beef and goat more then 5 stars. The draw 98% really good.Otherwise, good meal for two less than 20$. I will revisit to get Waakye soon.Do go, I like the food here!  Ghana Club.This was a no for me. (Alert! NO MENUS! YOU GOTTA FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR EVEN IF IT'S YOUR 1ST TIME!) I spent $36 dollars for dry joloff rice and dry tough beef. The spicy stew with goat was ok but it had an aftertaste that I personally didn't like. The fufu was good though. I've saved some to eat with some caribbean peper pot instead. So I'm still on the hunt for a good ghanaian/nigerian/african spot in BK..I've been looking for an African Restaurant everywhere, and I finally found one.  It was very close to home. It was my first time trying Okra Soup and Fufu. When I came to the store, I thought it was closed. I didn't know I had to ring a doorbell. I rang the doorbell and a man approached. He was very sweet. I said it's my first time here. He said I can tell. I said do you have Fufu. He said yes. I said okay and what do you usually eat with it. He said we have peanut butter soup and okra soup, but people mostly eat Fufu with okra soup. I said okay. It was $20. I said okay that's not as cheap as I accepted it to be. The okra soup was in a big bowl. It wasn't in a small bowl. When I tried it, it taste really good. The goat meat was so tender. I didn't like the cow skin. Was too tough. I don't know why they don't cook the cow skin. My poor teeth. I didn't like Fufu. I thought I would like it, but I would come back for the okra soup though. It had fish bones, goat meat, and cow skin. Also, they should update the place. It looks depressing in there honestly. If they update the place and leave the door open that would be great..I love this place! Their jollof and fish dish is always on point. Be sure to call in your order so it's ready for pickup when you get there. They usually take about 15 min to prepare your dish..It's OK, had Jollof rice and goat meat which cost 17$. The rice tasted like Briyani rice which I'm not fund of and was made with Basmati rice. Goat meat was well seasoned with a nice texture.  Also thought this was Nigerian place but it's not.The food is wonderful. The portions are GENEROUS. We ordered catering for 8 people...and it was easily enough food for 20 people. The jollof rice is exactly the way I like it--very flavorful, not too dry. The stew that comes with it is perfect and I want the recipe. Catering orders come with a jar of shito! It's delicious. I'm looking forward to getting take out again soon..This was my first Ghanaian food experience and it was amazing! Can't wait to go back. The food is made fresh to order and it's sooooo flavorful and spicy. $15 for a plate that included a huge portion of jollof, beef with sautéed peppers and onions, carrots, and plantain. All cooked to perfection. Like others have said, you ring the bell, a nice lady comes to let you in, you chit chat a bit, and you either tell her what you want or you let her make suggestions. Go for the latter -- let her make suggestions. She won't steer you wrong. There are some tables and seats, so you can sit and enjoy your meal there."

"I come very often here for lunch, friendly staff and more the lunch menu offers good non spicy food.They also make kim chi to buy in jars without msg.Check out their box menus for lunch..Ding Dong, Ding Dong! The restaurant sounds like an old door bell ringing. Well, the doors are wide open here so you could let yourself in.They have some pics of the food they serve hung on the wall as you walk in the entrance,  The food is typical Korean comfort food, not the best and not the worst either.We ordered the Ramen noodles and they tasted like your average store bought variety. The broth was nice and spicy without being too overly salted. We also ordered the fried dumpling appetizers, the dumplings were fried up perfectly and crusted on the outside, but the filling was mediocre in taste.The Bulgogi box is served with salad, rice, dried tofu and broccoli. The bulgogi was tender and tasty but they didn't give you a lot of it. I didn't know that sausage gimbap was code for luncheon meat, but it was OK and was a nicely sized rollThe service staff was very friendly and attentive and English spoken here was fluent so no issues in that department.  A side note, if you need to use the bathroom, it's the white door in the back that says employees only, but they let their patrons use it.Overall an average spot to get your Korean comfort food fix..This place is my absolute favorite and my go-to for fresh, homemade, Korean comfort food. I come here at least 3 times per month for my fix. Sang and Tammy are like extended family to me and everytime I come here they warmly welcome me and automatically know at least half of my regular order. I've had the boxes, the Katsu, the Kong guksoo, the Ramen, and the Twigim. All delcious. But my favorites? The spicy tuna gimbap and kimchi fried rice. O M G........sooooo good! Everything is made fresh and right in front of you...even the rolls! Also, Sangs' freshly made side dishes, especially her homemade kimchi are some of the best I've ever had....ever.This place is extremely unassuming, humble and clean. The emphasis is always on the flavor and love reflected in Sangs' cooking. Ding Dong continuously makes my mouth and stomach very happy....and I promise that it will do the same for yours too! :).Food was good and decent portion. Liked their galbi beef bento box. A lot can be improved though. The miso soup was little salty. Gimbap was too bland..Got the bulgogi box this time and it was ok. It wasn't worth $7.95, plus tax which came to $11. The bulgogi tasted good and the pieces were pretty thick, but there wasn't a lot of it, mostly rice. It also included a small salad with some kind of vinaigrette and some watercress with slices of spicy fishcake as sides (I didn't find spicy at all, which I like, I wish there was more). My friend ordered the cheese tteokbokki with dumplings and it was mostly sauce and had very little cheese. I think I'll just stick with the bulgogi kimbap..I ordered the bulgogi kimbap, $5.50, the portions are reasonable and the bulgogi is well seasoned. I wish they had kimchi bulgogi kimbap like Chung Moo Rollrice & Dongas, but this is a good substitute:) Plus it's a little cheaper.I picked my food up, but I would love to have stay and dined in. The décor is really cute and the place is pretty spacious. They seem to answer the phone in Korean, but they do speak English, so that's a plus..I love this place.  I feel like family every time I come in here.  Ajumma always comes to me and cooks me extra and knows I like extra kimchi!  The kimchi is made in house it is good!  You cannot beat the price for this Korean fast food!  The spicy pork box is my favorite I get it every time and I like to try new things I just don't know how to cause I actually crave it once I walk in.  So I lose the battle with my tongue and taste buds and give in.  Next time my brain will win.  But for now spicy pork box has accomplished it's mission and it is the taste bud champion.  I am actually salvating right now thing about it.....  Just get here early they do close around 8pm..Had a the sushi lunch special and they were cheap but you definitely get what you paid for.  Not good.  Tried the oodong noodle soup as well as the chicken bento box and they were much better.  Was the first restaurant I've ever been to where I felt I could smell Kim chee from the water they served us.  At the end they did bring us a seafood pancake so that was nice..From a korean snack food place that I was ordering delivery from, I didn't expect much at all but I am pleasantly surprised that it's all still in perfect place and the food is still hot. My main dish came with 2 sides, salad, and a soup! All very reasonably priced in fact. None of their dishes are pricey. Just wish they handed out menus...Been coming to the place since it opened up.  LOVE IT HERE !!! This is our favorite Korean place, great food, always fresh and the staff is always happy to see us.We've been sticking to the Fried Dumplings and Bulgogi Box each time we visit.  The Bulgogi Box is always a surprise to us because they change the sides every time.  The Bulgogi meat itself has lots of flavor, my 16-month old child can't get enough of it.Highly recommend this place to everyone..love it!!!good price, fresh rice and fish. Miso soup a little bit too salty. but generally speak, it's very good!!!"
"Went here for dinner just to try something new out on Bell Blvd. The appetizer was actually delicious, we just wished there was more squid in it lol. I ordered the Tropical Roll and it was okay, tbh now that I'm thinking back on my roll, i feel like it didn't have all of the fish it said it would in the menu (salmon, yellowtail & tuna)? It tasted more like just a salmon avocado roll with the caviar on top but i didn't really look at it too in depth when i was eating it. Bf got the King Roll and when i tasted it i wish i had gotten it instead of my tropical roll lol. It just tasted a lot better (my favorite of the three rolls). He also ordered a Lara Roll after and it was pretty good too. Overall, i had no problem with how the rice or fish tasted. Rolls were pretty good for the price. But i will say the best part of our meal was the appetizer (osi tashi ika)..Wow this is really good. My wife and I enjoyed our dinner here. They are wepp prices and tasty. Honestly think they can charge more.Ordered bunch stuff to carry out.  Sushi was fine and basic items were okay.  Overall decor and service was fine - clean and tidy; service was great.  There were someindoor patrons so it was nice to see on a weekday.For the ramen, it was pretty good. My only recommendation is to probably separate all items fromsoup. The noodles were separated but all else was inside the soup, resulting in some soggy items.  I know there is still a learning process.  Wishing this local business a load of success. Please support your local businesses!!.We came here for Friday dinner. We got here around 7:30pm. Plenty of seats. We ordered 7 special rolls: House Special Roll, Tropical Roll, USA roll, New York Roll, honey bee roll, James Bond Roll, and Chilian Roll. There's one person serving and one chef so the service is a bit slow because it gets busy with phone call orders and dine-in folks. It was almost full by the time we were leaving. My favorite rolls were James Bond roll, House Special roll, and USA roll. I definitely want to come back here. It's reasonably priced for special sushi rolls..My order looked nothing like the takeout or dine in photos of the food. The sushi rice was mushy and the rolls were tiny. The shrimp tempura was doused in sauce and the salmon avocado pieces were extra small. The king roll was disappointing because it just tasted like rice and none of the fillings of soft shell crab or kani salad..I can't believe I've never been to this place.  The interior looks really quaint and cozy, like a little Japanese village.  I'm looking forward to a regular meal here rather than take out sushi.  When we got the meal home, we discovered that the salmon sushi/sashimi were off.  There was definitely a not so fresh smell to them and and tasted off.  We the tried the spicy salmon roll, which did not smell due to it being in sauce.  But, it did tasted off as well.  The rest of the meal was ok.  Not the best.  But, we chalked it up to Covid/lack of staff, etc.  We'll come back and try a regular meal once things are back to normal.  The dining room looks like a cool hang out place..While deciding what to eat during COVID, we found this place & decided to try it out. I have to say, their bento box game is pretty solid. The portions are pretty good for the price you pay - they definitely don't cheap out on the good stuff. My boyfriend & I had also ordered some appetizers. Trust me when I say, it was filling enough for dinner and we even had enough for leftovers.I can see myself being a regular here. The wait isn't long & the prices are pretty reasonable. Plus, I'm still able to get a good sushi fix here!.I went to Kenta Sushi today because the place I was originally going to have lunch at (also in the area) was packed. When I came in, it took the waiter a while to notice us. But as soon as she realized that we were  dining in, she brought us to our seats. I ordered a shrimp bento lunch special and my friend ordered a chicken bento lunch special. Again, it took a while to come, but we were given water and miso soup first. When the bento box came I couldn't help but notice how pretty it was. The presentation was neat, but there was a lot of empty space on the tray. My shrimp bento box consisted of rice, (ramen) noodle with shrimp and vegetable, salad, and four pieces of sushi. It was fun eating it and I enjoyed the flavors they used. It was very filling for $9. I would come back again to try the other items on the menu, but the service was on the slower side..You would expect that a $11-$13 special roll is kinda affordable, but it's more so a rip off. I got three spicy salmon rolls, one tuna roll, and four special rolls- all together $78 before tip. Some may think it's an average price, but the SIZING of the sushi piece is unbelievably bad. It's so small, barely any tuna, and it's so mushy that it falls apart. I usually get full with two spicy salmon rolls but I had to order two more special rolls to really fill me up. And it was not good at all, nor was the spicy Mayo, the spicy Mayo I barely touched. Will never come back.The kani salad was good but it was too salty, the roll was mushy the sweet shrimp had no flavor otherwise was good"
"It was a really great experience over here. Came along with my friends for lunch, friendly staffs and food is delicious as expected. Authentic taste of Indian and Nepali as well. Overall happy moments. Definitely recommend this place for south asian taste!.I ordered delivery from this place and was shocked how quick it came on a Wednesday evening! It's only 10mins by car so that's most likely why. Ordered: Lamb bryani2 different naans (regular and garlic)Chicken vindaloo I felt that the quality was pretty good, naan bread looked pretty big - which was amazing soft and fluffy and the flavors were on point. The chicken was a little tough but it's probably bc they use the same chicken from the tandoori grilled so it can be rather dry. They might be able to improve on that.Sauce was good, we ate all of it and the lamb was tender in the Biryani. It's a tad overpriced (but given the area that makes sense) but for this quality I would order it again..Very satisfying food ! Went for dinner and had an amazing experience.The staffs were really friendly and the food was with nice amount with the deliciousness..I ordered the Vegetarian Lunch Box off of their site. It didn't really have a description but I searched Yelp reviews for what it may look like and I was thinking it would have 2 different vegetables. However, I was just given 2 of Chana Saag. I wish there was a description on what is included in the lunch specials to make it clear. It was $12 for rice, 1 vegetable, and naan which is still a good price. I asked for Spice and it was a really great flavor and spicy. The naan kind of sucks. Its really thick and came kind of crumbly. I wouldn't order naan from here if you're craving it lolOverall, food was good. But, I wish the menu was clear on whats included & I wish quality of naan was better..I've been looking for a new go-to Indian spot and I think this is The One. Ordered the:* Butter chicken: creamy and delicious.* Chana saag: big portion, more spinach than chickpeas.* Butter naan: fluffy, perfect.If you order delivery, do it through their website because you'll get 10% off $30 with code SPICE10. Also I noticed the dish costs are lower than they are through external delivery services. Also to note, they ask if you want ""mild, regular, spice, or extra spicy"" for each dish. I chose ""spice"" and they weren't playing around! But it was a good, flavorful spice, not overwhelming or painful. I guess i should expect that given the name. :).Craving Indian cuisine, I ordered take out from this establishment. I really appreciated that the 15% off from the Yelp check in, which the place honored even though there is no dining in during this time. While I was waiting, the person who took my order, provided me with a complimentary spiced black tea, which tasted so comforting, wonderful, and slightly exotic, with notes of clove and chai. I decided to order the Tandoor Mix Grill, garlic naan and of course, Mangolassi, my favorite Indian drink. The Mangolassi was incredibly bright orange and had a weird aftertaste to it that is difficult to describe. I did like how it was extremely thick, chilled though. It was just a tad too sweet. I wasn't a fan of the garlic naan. There wasn't enough garlic for me and the naan was too thick - I prefer thinner and crunchy, while still being fluffy. This meal also came with basmati rice. The Tandoori Mix Grill consisted of chicken, lamb, beef and shrimp. Everything was flavored beautifully with a perfect amount of char and crispness. My favorite was the shrimp, which was nice and juicy. The lamb was also very tasty, and quite tender. I think my least favorite was the beef, as it was a bit on the tough side. Overall, I wasn't that impressed and would probably not return..I wish the portions were a tad bigger given the cost however the flavor of the dishes are on point. Saag Paneer: delicious! Dal Tadka: asked to make spicy and it was holy crap spicy which we loved. Chicken Biryani - great flavoring of rice and chicken was moistWe are glad to have an Indian spot not too far from us that we will now regularly order from..I was so pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food from this place! It was so delicious and flavorful and just what I was hoping for. I got the aloo gobi and veggie momos and I can't wait for my next order. Best of all they're on Deliverzero so less waste and the food is still super hot when it's delivered!.Spice & Grill is the best Indian restaurant in Fort Greene/Clinton Hill, in my opinion (I believe I've tried them all.)  Everything we've ordered here has had bright vivid flavors.  Besides the delicious food, we've been super impressed with their delivery  - on time every time, and that Spice & Grill participates in the ""Deliver Zero"" program  - the plastic containers are high quality and are returnable to the restaurant for re-use.why not five stars?  as others here have said, the portions are a bit small for the price..Literally Does Not Miss!!!! Came here to eat outside on a Friday night w 2 others and it was soooo good. We split goat biryani, kadai paneer, and aloo gobi!"

"For being in a gas station this is one of the best Dunkin's around. Never really a line, food and drinks are on point so not a complaint to be named. While filling up on gas I recommend you get a iced caramel latte..Very disappointed at this location!  My coffee was disgusting didn't even tasted like coffee but milk only . So asked them to please add some more coffee to it,  their answer was that I had to pay extra for them to fix it. It's not fair that I had to pay extra for me to be able to have a better tasting ""coffee""..I was a regular customer of this franchise location ever since this store opened up last year and had been pleased with the overall service I received. However, I will never go to this location after I was greeted with sheer discrimination and confrontation from the cashier Farzana at this location-life is simply too short to dwell on the agony. I am a huge DD fan and use the DD app regularly to rack up points, redeem coupons, and of course beverages. I never had any problem at any other DD locations when I use the official DD app to purchase and redeem drinks. As an educated consumers, I have always used credit card to load up DD account and never paid with cash. I had always visited this location at least three times a week, if not daily to buy ice coffee/ice latte using the DD app. When I showed Farzana my reward of last week via the official email I received from DD, she went postal on me. First, she accused me of ""never paying for my drink"" in front of 5 customers behind me with an elevated tone. Second, she took out a pen and wrote down the coupon number of the coupon and said that she would ""investigate"" me, hinting I was stealing or otherwise illegally fabricated the coupon. Lastly, when I explained to her that I have always ""paid via the app"" but she just would not listened and told me to take my ice latte.I have never been more confused and disappointed at a food establishment. This specific franchise location has proven to discourage potential customers from using DD app and want me to pay cash. If this is the case, perhaps the management of location should post cash/credit card only. I am a paying customer yet in her eyes, I am somehow a thief because I am redeeming a free drink. Are you kidding me? Farzana, I understand that in retail business you may be working for long hours, but you should never be treating loyal and returning customers like a thief. What has gotten to DD customer service these days?.I go here everyday for iced cold brew. Today is my last time I will ever come here. The lady that works there I always see her sitting in the side of the cash register. Today I ordered a 2 for 5 bagel and cream cheese. I wanted to substitute a bagel with croissant and the current cashier said I can swap it. But to that lady she happen to speak my native language and she was talking shit about my order !!! She probably didn't realize I am fluent in her language. It's disgusting what they say. Horrible person and disgusting attitude. I will make sure my complaint go very far to get her in trouble..This place is terrible. Well at least the people that they hire in this location. The staff are mono tone. Plus they cannot speak or comprehend English. When they run out of something and that's the exact thing you order- forget about it!! - the only response you will get is a  ""no"" or is that a ""know"" or maybe a ""now?""  What the hell is NO supposed to mean that I did not understand? How about a pleasant full reply such as ""we apologize but ran out of such and such thing.""  Worse part about it hard to park without being blocked or boxed in.  It would have been a great addition for the area but not a strategic location especially in a very small tight busy gas station. A convenient DD that became inconvenient.  Don't come here!!!.These guys are fast friendly & efficient! Quick w/ my lattes before I jump onto my highways!  Kudos to the crew"
"Omg!!! This bar was amazing and so was Juan!! If you are ever around check it out. Expensive drinks? No way. Best place I have ever been to. Totally recommend this place if you want to have a good time and bestie time.They're known to try to overcharge patrons for extra drinks then have bouncers assault those who catch on (even those still willing to tip on the correct order). I'd recommend going elsewhere but accompanying friends who insist on going.Sexual assault on the dance floor is more or less explicitly allowed by on site security..Pretty dull and the vibes are simply off. Bouncers are interesting - laughing at you if you're not a ""VIP"" even if it's your first time. They scan your ID and chuckle that you're not a VIP and tell you to tip better. Did not stay long as it simply did not feel worthwhile..I was ripped off and charged $90.00 for 6 well vodkas. I later then checked my bank account and the bartender added a $10 tip for himself that I did not authorize. Fortunately American Express is taking the money back from the bar..NEVER AGAIN. I was soo excited to go with 3 friends BUT the security at the door was unforgettably AND unacceptably rude. He said he didn't like how I ""grabbed my ID out of his hand."" All complete BS. He was pulling a power play. He had no explanation other than that. He was playing on his ego. I WILL NEVER put myself or my friends thru this type of disrespect to go out anywhere in NY, there's too much to experience and enjoy..I was there the other night on Tuesday Latin night bouncer is rude and also I cursed at them when I was drunk and  came second day to apologize and he was acting stupid dont  go to this bar there many options in the area and also the owner did it even try adress the issue Not a place if u want to feel safe their service bad.Your security last night behaved violently and bully! This is not okay ! Good that I have videos recorded and definitely going to sue them. I tried to contact administration but no answer. Ritz slowly because place with bad reputation and violent behavior! Falls for your safety I don't recommend this place !.As I mentioned on another review, another small gay bar in New York. Like most bars and dance clubs in New York City, the bar is small. The space itself is nice enough. Drinks are expensive. It was OK..This is such a trashy place. I was there during a happy hour special on well drinks and asked the pretentious bartender for a recommendation. His response? ""Couldn't tell ya."" How lovely. What I got wasn't good, and I believe I was sneakily double-charged. Obnoxiously loud music in a claustrophobic environment. The guys at the door checking vaccine cards were stupid as hell, quibbling over little details and then chuckling over the ruse they were creating, like straight guys with no sense of humor do, probably singling me out because I live outside of town. I only give a second star because the drag queen performing in the background on this Thursday night had charisma in spades and truly earned every bit of the money she made. She almost made me want to stay - but I couldn't wait to get out of this place - which felt like the pit of hell - and head to someplace classy. I went to Joe Allen's and had the best drink and stimulating conversation. It's still to be had in New York sometimes; you just have to know where to find it..Is it possible to give negative stars? Came in for one drink and got the worse service at a gay bar ever (I frequent weho and the fruit loop so this is a fair assessment). Look I know NYC is filled with rude people and scammers but I didn't think it would take form in ""The Ritz"". Have you ever seen a bill with no items on it? Look below. Shady ass white gays who think they're the best"
"The mapo tofu uses Szechuan peppercorn, so it has a good tingling spice.The general TSO chicken also has chicken in it t. Been to many other places where it was mostly the breaded outside..Not so sure what the hype is about. Just average quality Chinese food. Was not bad but nothing phenomenal. They don't deliver - I had to go pick up and they are cash only..Tasty Chinese takeout without having to get to Chinatown. I had the lo mein and the fried dumplings and enjoyed both. Excited to go back and try a few more things. Great service as well. I called ahead and my order was ready within 10 minutes. Definitely recommend!.Drunk me remembers this being excellent food. Sober me regrets everything. Sober me also understands drunk me's need to consume an abnormal amount of lomein the night before. Drunk me is forgiven by sober me. Drunk me would come here again.Also incredibly friendly staff :).Just picked up yesterday. Great food! This will be my go-to Chinese spot now. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken combo platter with lomein and my husband had the general tso's chicken with fried rice, each came with an egg roll. My meal was so good and I love the taste of the sweet and sour sauce! My husband enjoyed his as well. Very generous portions and the employees are super friendly! Also I ordered the hot and sour soup and let me tell you.. it is AMAZING! I think it's actually the best hot and sour soup I've had. Great flavor, hearty, perfect amount of spice and texture was on point.Last thing is my order was done in only 10 mins, we showed up 20 mins after and even after taking it back home the food was still piping hot!No complaints here... oh just.. it's cash only.They have an ATM..For a sesame shrimp and it wasn't that hood but everything else was. I had cheese wontons and an egg roll. But I'm surprised that the sesame shrimp was awful.Beware!!!!! It has been two weeks since I last visited this restaurant. I normally do not eat at too many Chinese restaurants. However, the one day that I didn't bring my lunch to work is the day I decided to  stop by and grab something to eat. I ordered plain lo mein with boneless chicken which is something that I never ordered but I wanted something different. Little did I know that something different was going to creep up on me. I was enjoying the food while I consumed it, although I was uncertain about the boneless chicken which you can never be certain if it is chicken. Fast forward to exactly 24 hours after consuming the food, I began to feel very sick. I was suffering with abdominal cramps, diarrhea, loss of appetite (which is a rarity for me lol), fever, nausea which are all symptoms of food poisoning. I was ill for four days and unable to eat anything as well. I love to eat food but I do not like to get sick because someone failed to handle the food properly. With that being said, I will not purchase anything from this restaurant in the future. I'll stick to my regular Chinese restaurants..The best Chinese food I have ever had! I normally don't enjoy General Tso's chicken but I decided to try for something new and ended up falling in love. Def will visit again..Low price option for lunch in this area which is great since Brooklyn is getting to be an expensive place very fast.  A meal now requires me to do overtime.  Great greasy Chinese takeout and they do give very good portions so you do get a great value.  A big fan of the crab rangoon.  I love fried stuff at Chinese restaurants for some reason.  Hopefully they don't get pushed out of the neighborhood like other reasonably priced restaurants..Not only is the food extremely good, but the friendly neighborhood feeling from this restaurant is what keeps me coming back. They recommend their favorites, throw in the occasional free soda, and always have me leaving with a smile. A true BedStuy staple."
"The BEST burger in NYC!!! Wonderful seasoning, and huge sized patty on pita bread, with choice of feta or American cheese. The chicken shish-kabob on a stick was very nicely grilled, but they foolishly wrapped only in tin foil for delivery, so the juices and marinade escaped onto the paper bag instead of in my mouth. Fries could use a bit more of a cook. Definitely avoid for dessert the Loukomades, like a Greek zeppole; they were drenched in so much oil from the deep fry that I had to wrap each in several paper towels to squeeze out the grease. But overall, I would definitely order again. The burger was really sensational, the chicken kabob was tasty, and though they're located on the far East Side near York Ave, they deliver to the Upper West Side! Plus, and they're open late, one of the few places I was able to order delivery at almost 11 pm. So, order and enjoy!.Stay away. Rude and unfriendly staff. Incapable of meeting estimated delivery timelines..Meh, lunch leaves a lot to be desired. Chicken souvlaki was the greasiest I've ever seen, and for some reason they put the pita underneath the chicken, so it soaked up all the grease and became complete mush.Tzatziki sauce was flavorless, in fact nothing really had much flavor with the exception of the potatoes, which I did actually find good.Overpriced and subpar, would not recommend, would not go back..Massive delays and rude hostess. We have ordered from this place several times and 80% of the time they are late. Yesterday we placed an order at around 1130am and the food did not arrive until 130pm. When we called the ""hostess"" she plainly replied that they were busy. No apologies of any kind. We will not order from this restaurant again..Yia Yia's was so great. Would recommend. A quick walk from Central Park, so easy to get to (beautiful area/walk). Phenomenal taste and large portions. Reasonably priced and nice staff. Will go back!.Stopped in over lunch time during the week and even with a moderate crowd there was hardly a wait. The food was really good too- I got the Spanokopita as a starter which was flaky and warm and yum, and a chicken sandwich which was also great. I brought it home to eat and it traveled well- not greasy or anything. A little pricey for me since the sandwich doesn't come with a side, although many things are like that these days, but was really good and I'd certainly return to try another menu item next..I've ordered from Yia Yia's several times since moving to the UES. Everything has always been delicious. I usually order the lamb gyro sandwich or platter, avgolemono soup, greek lemon potatoes always instead of french fries and the quality and flavors are consistently great. I have walked in once and there is plenty of indoor seating. Their customer service is excellent and they are pretty quick with preparation. I saw lots of takeout bags lined up for delivery companies. The Greek Salad was wonderful and ingredients were fresh. I will continue to support this local Greek Spot!.I loooved Yia Yia's lemon potatoes. It was my first time having tried them and wow were they flavorful.  I ordered the falafel plate with lemon potatoes and hummus; the salad was fresh and the falafels were crispy. The hummus was unfortunately quite bland, though very creamy, so I didn't eat as much as I usually do with the pita bread at other restaurants. I would add a little extra oomf to the flavor of the falafel's, but they had an excellent consistency and crunch. The lady who took my order was very sweet and the service itself was fairly quick..If you're looking for a casual dining place to have great Greek food at amazing price, this is the place. The staff couldn't be nicer and it is a bright modern clean place with a lot of seats and a good location. I would definitely recommend this place and come back..Second visit, this time for dinner to go.  We shared a Greek salad - ample portion for the two of us, with 5 or 6 cubes of feta, red onion, and a few kalamata olives.  Light dressing, good salad.  We again shared a spanakopita, one of my favorite foods.  For mains, we ordered one chicken souvlaki plate and one vegetable souvlaki plate.  Each came with 2 skewers of either 6 nice chicken cubes or 6 hefty pieces of vegetable: 2 big chunks of eggplant, 2 big chunks of zucchini, and 2 big chunks of tomato.  Of course, we shared the skewers.  You get a lovely side of Greek salad with the souvlaki plate, so we have salad for tomorrow night!  Plenty of pita wedges, bot with the large Greek salad we had shared, and then soaking up the juices from our skewers.  The side we both chose was lemon potatoes, and I must say they were really lemony and delicious!  A small cup of tzatziki rounded out the souvlaki plate and it's a great tzatziki.Glad this was our dinner choice this evening!.Walking around our new neighborhood, we noticed this place on a side street.  I could live on Greek food so I couldn't resist going to take a look.I already had some fish at home for dinner; we bought 2 spanakopita to go with it.  It was warm even after a 14-block walk home in cold weather but I heated it in the oven on a tray anyway.  Delicious!There are maybe 2 tables inside, which seems to be a small amount of what could be there, if no pandemic.  The salads and the desserts in the glass case we're very tempting!  We're looking forward to going back there for lunch sometime soon!"
"My omakase experience has been a couple 1 Michelin star sushi places in Singapore and Bay Area as well as Masa in NYC. I was pretty excited to try this 2 Michelin star sushi place and it did not disappoint! By far my favourite omakase that I've ever had. I'm pretty sure it was just Chef Ichimura who was handling everything as I didn't see anyone in the back kitchen. He serves everyone at the counter and plates all the appetizers as well. It was great to see him work his magic! In terms of appetizers, my favourite was the uni with caviar pie. I did like the appetizers from Masa better overall so there is some room for improvement! Definitely where this place shines is in the sushi courses. The fish was so fresh and none of them fishy at all , including the needlefish sushi which I find typically very fishy. The way he does the chutoro (2 slices) and otoro (3 slices) is amazing. I actually usually prefer chutoro to otoro because otoro can be too heavy for me. But I'm this case, I didn't find it too heavy at all. Both of them literally melt in your mouth in the most magical way. For dessert, they could go a bit more creative than just ice cream though it was yummy. After dinner, the chef personally said goodbye to all the guests at the door. Service was amazing - I would definitely come back! Highly highly recommend for all omakase lovers..When I think of the perfect dining experience I think back to my time at Uchu.Having just been to Sushi Noz on the UES I was excited to see how Uchu would compare, and im happy to say not only Sushi Noz did not stand a chance but also a lot of michelin star restaurants were put to shame. The only question I was left with was ""when are they receiving their third star?'We were punctual with our dinner reservation for their second seating but found most guests waiting outside, I was puzzled to see Uchu making us wait outside but figured they must need time to prepare the whole place for the second wave of guests. Turns out a gentleman who was standing by the door did not pull it hard enough and thought the door was locked, more guests arrived and some of us made assumptions about the door being locked and others asked the man standing by the door if the door was locked which he promptly confirmed it. Lessons were learned, don't ever assume or trust other guests as they also don't know what they are doing. After a 15 min delay he finally pulls the door open and realizes he just made the rest of us late, after this comical gaffe we finally head in, all 8 guests at once.I would like to say thank you to both Chef Ichimura, a kind, hard working and extremely talented chef who makes you wanna cry when you watch him prepare your meal, and our somm Leo who was beyond excellent from greeting guests to assisting the chef, as though one conducts a symphony. I was trully in awe of the preparation that was taken for a small group of people dining with them. Every single detail was carefully thought of and rehearsed, even their playlist, comprised mostly of jazz, touched a string in my heart when ""Everything happens to me"" by Chet Baker started playing as I sipped on a George Laval Champagne that was recommended and it delivered everything and much more.They have a fantastic wine menu, I could look at it for hours, unfortunately I have to leave at some point so I must decide on a bottle. I do recommend you take a stroll through their champagne section and spending a bit more than you usually would, it is filled with a lot of hard to find exciting champagne growers, delivering incredible depth for a more than fair price. I often encounter tired michelin star restaurants who held their place on the ranks for too long. But for Uchu everything is new and exciting, despite being veterans in the restaurant scene, they serve dinner as though it is their first and last. The food isn't demanding and it's not sitting in a glass dome with a mushroom, it's astonishing and straight forward, timeless and truthful. I can't wait to come back.Extraordinary and exceptional and exquisite. I really enjoy their style of service, and appreciate it immensely. They're glad you're there, they're incredibly attentive and observant and helpful, but they also stand back and wait until it's appropriate. Not once were they intrusive or solicitous. And they were also very accommodating of my particular eating style. Namely, I eat slowly. They were fine with lining then up on my plate if necessary while I fixated on all the overwhelming textures and flavors. Very gratefully, this was a truly memorable and remarkable experience..Spectacular omakase experience. Each piece was beyond fresh and flavorful. Even the ginger was the best I've ever had (I kept eating it as a snack :P) The portion is the most generous among other high end sushi places. There was lots of memorable pieces like the shrimp, uni and otoro. There was a steamed eel sushi with thick broth - very creative and interesting. Chef was always smiling. And the service was excellent and detail-oriented. Well deserved Michelin 2 stars. Will def come back..One of the best dining experiences I have ever had.  The service was excellent, Leo was very attentive and knowledgeable. My gf and I loved the intimate setting and how Chef Ichimura prepares everything himself. I've eaten at some of the best sushi places in the world and this is one of the best. The rice was perfect, temperature and seasoning. I can't think of one dish or piece of sushi that I thought was less than spectacular..For a special occasion, in a very intimate setting and concentrate on savoring the flavors of Japan where you discover the authenticity of its cuisine, personalized attention and prices above the average Para una ocasión especial, en un ambiente muy íntimo y concentrarse en paladear los sabores de Japón en el que descubres la autenticidad de su cocina, atención personalizada y precios por arriba del promedio.An unforgettable experience of traditional Japanese cuisine, unique and subtle flavors, freshness and generous portions of Uni and Toro, the service is excellent in a very pleasant silence to enjoy the unique flavors of this delicious cuisineUna experiencia inolvidable de la cocina tradicional japonésa, sabores únicos y sutiles, frescura y porciones generosas de Uni y Toro, el servicio es excelente en un  de completo silencio muy agradable para poder disfrutar de los sabores únicos de esta deliciosa cocina.I enjoyed my experience here more than Masa.At Masa, Mr. Masa and another chef made sushi for a group of 6. I had the other chef and for the first 3 pieces of sushi, the rice was not packed properly. I felt like my experience overall was degraded. Here as Uchu, Mr. Ichimura handled all 9 guests. I felt like the experience overall was better because of that.Two items especially stood out to me here.One was the uni cracker sandwich. It was basically a lots of uni and rice with a top and bottom cracker made out of those cheap ice cream cones. I've never had anything like it before. It was so unique and there was so much uni! The second were the toro pieces. Normally it's 1 piece of fish on top of rice, but for the 2 toro pieces,  Mr. Ichimura put three pieces of fish on each piece! It also wasn't the same consecutive cuts. He made sure that each piece was from a different piece of toro, probably for variety and consistency. It was super tasty and definitely unique. I've never seen this done at other places.Overall I had a great experience here. The food was great. The ambiance was intimate. The service was great. I'd recommend others checking this place out!.The uni is sooooo great!Will definitely come here again in the future! Love the chef here so handsome hhhh.I had the pleasure to be Mr. Ichimura's guest just a little before Christmas 2019. While it was not a ""life changing"" experience (no act of eating should be), it certainly was a memorable one that me and my wife talk about often.Mr. Ichimura and his staff are without a doubt, the embodiment of ""Shokunin""- Modest, silent, yet work relentlessly striving to be the best in their field; and ""Omotenashi""- Wholeheartedly looking after guests while dignified as the best, most professional, in their very line of work. The food- Furthermore the service, are great representations of traditional Japanese hospitality and professionalism. I want to commend Mr. Ichimura and his sake sommelier for the great pleasure of being your guest of the evening.I don't want to spend too much time talking about food. You will find conventional praise in other reviews. Just pay attention to the rice, it's a sophisticated blend. Pay attention to its temperature when Nigiri's served... in your mouth in contrast with the fish. How the subtle sweetness with just the right warmth accentuates the natural flavors of the great selection of fish Ichimura for his guests. Try to feel the air between the grains, the fluffy texture, as the fish melts and blends in your mouth... how the flavors express themselves in those ephemeral moments.... An experience that is rare to come by in a lifetime.  There is a dress code in Uchu. I want to point out that if you go there in shitty cloths- other guests hate you! Please don't go in a T-shirt or ugly sweater. Look at Mr. Ichimura- Every night he greets his guests with freshly ironed Kimono/Yukata, and he's working in a kitchen. Every staff member is in full suit. Please show some respect for these professionals. I was irritated by a pair of Chinese trust fund kids who didn't give a damn and dressed poorly. Uchu was compassionate even though I want them out- It's not about snobbiness, it's about respect. Imagine you are the best at your field (tech, medicine, hospitality, social work), when you serve, you want to be acknowledged. Only those who don't work have no respect for others.Their bar is currently under renovation- a disappointment, because the one down the road that was recommended (Bar Goto) was crowded and had pretty rude services.A tip- Try to get the Sake pairing. Me and my wife started without the pairing because we saw some rare French vintage and wanted to order it. Seeing other guests getting a great variety of excellent sake next to us, full of attention and great stories- We got a little jealous and caught up with the pairing. It was excellent.Despite the invoice, which had a comma, I would happily come back. Like Masa, this is an obligatory visit when you're in NY and want to call yourself a sushi connoisseur. Thank you Mr. Ichimura!.This place ranks amongst the best dining experiences EVER. And not just in the sushi category... hospitality and service were unmatched. We had only told them we were celebrating a birthday BUT the host researched about us and found out that our anniversary is in a few weeks and that we have a son  so throughout the night Chef Ichimura and the hosts regularly congratulated us on our anniversary and said happy birthday! The food is amazing. So many dishes that made you go ""WOW"" for lack of a more sophisticated word. Like the uni, caviar, and wasabi sandwich  or the unforgettable sablefish sushi or the impeccable 3 layer toro sushi or the globs of Hokkaido uni  so much to say about this place. And I didn't even mention the journey we took with the sake pairing. The host gave us societal and cultural background on every single same - not just notes or fragrances to taste. This place was just on another level. No brainer why it's got 2 Michelin stars and if anything I'm wondering if it's quaint LES location prevents it from having 3 because this place rivals Masa (another all time fave of mine). And of course those who have seen Chef Ichimura in action at Brushstroke know all this already. If you can, highly recommend getting one of the only 20 seats he serves every evening. You will forever remember the experience and never ever regret it. P.S. I was so excited eating I forgot to take pics of 3 sushi pieces  But those pieces are imbedded in my memory forever!"
"Consistently great staff even before the following inside the occurred: 7/23/20 I placed and order and after waited 1hr 15min I called the location to inquire about my delivery. Door dash somehow messed up the pick up by neglecting to deliver it at all. The manager replaced the order within minutes. Including giving me a complementary extra side. The entire staff was responsive and genuinely cared. Unusual for a fast food restaurant. Great staff and manager/management..Be prepared to wait and wait and wait some more if you want food or good service. If you have time to go to another Popeyes establishment just go there altogether! They're more concerned with how they look then being punctual and efficient at their job. Yeah it's just chicken but customer service and courtesy go a long way..The Popeyes is unbelievably unorganized and dishonest.For starters, I ordered 3 chicken sandwiches (2 spicy and 1 regular) The total came out to $13.03, so I gave the cashier a $20. The change that I should be getting back is $6.97. I don't know if the cashier thought I was dumb and/or she was trying to rip me off, but she handed me back 97 cents only. I later told her that I gave her a $20 bill so she had to ask her manager for the key to unlock the register so she can give me the remaining $6. Afterward,I stepped to the side to wait for my chicken sandwiches. Another customer behind me also ordered a chicken sandwich and she got hers in a matter of seconds after the cashier simply handed her one from the under the heat lamp. It wasn't until 5-10 minutes later when I got fed up with waiting and decided to ask for my sandwiches. They ""finally"" realized that my ticket had been sitting around for the past 10 minutes so they decided THEN to give me my sandwiches. I will never be back at this location again nor would I recommend this venue to anyone..If you're getting food from here for sustenance, it gets the job done at bare minimal. Otherwise, they have been getting my in store purchase and deliveries wrong for years with the explanation that they have new workers. Never provide sauces unless asking for it after receiving bag. Always gets the chicken selection wrong. Always missing a drinks. Sucks bc there aren't many eateries in the neighborhood.The absolute worst Popeyes in NYC.  4 People were ahead of me and I was served 25 Minutes later. I ordered a Chicken Sandwich that took another 15 minutes to prepare. Avoid this Popeyes at all cost..WTF!!!!I spent over $45! & still they gave me the littlest pieces of Chickens!!! Tenders Over Cooked!! Mash potatoes slightly soapy, Mac and cheese.... tastes Nasty!!!No Lettuce/tomatoes in my kids Chicken Sandwiches!I am Done with Parkchester Popeyes Restaurant!.Clueless or racist..can't tell these days. Just now I stood there for five minutes while two counter people -(who were just at the counter as cashiers) are putting things away, first time I just let it be. Then i was like, ""Anyone working at the counter?""and a Latina counter worker with glasses just looked through me. Another worker was helping the previous customer but usually one might say,"" just one moment"" to be courteous. Lol I guess that's why Burger King next door gets most of your business and why you guys only have two stars. I'm sure corporate is very happy with you lol.I don't usually review fast food but I do have an issue about really crappy workers. Lol.If I could leave zero stars I would. Smh for a fast food restaurant they move so slow. The manager gives zero f@cks and it shows. The food is not consistent and I wish they would just close down!.This Popeye's is terrible.  The service is SUPER SLOW.  Both in-person and for delivery.I waited 3 hours for an Uber Eats order and all I ordered was a chicken sandwich.  I only ordered from them because I had an UberEats voucher and everything else in the area was closed.  Never again!  I guess it's good that the service is horrible because it gives me no incentive to eat junk food..I hadn't been to this Popeyes since it's re opening due to some questionable things  that went down there before it closed- things of the poop variety . I figured that a ""grand reopening "" and a couple of months staying away would make it safe enough to eat their. Long story short the lines are extremely long and the staff is super slow moving. They have deals on occasion but you get what you pay for, at least at this chain. I made the mistake of ordering the $5 popcorn chicken meal and opened the box to find several large pieces of fried chicken skin and about 4 tiny pieces of fried chicken. My biscuit saved the meal"
"We came here for Restaurant Week and the food and service were both impeccable. Nothing complicated, just excellent value for money. The wine list was interesting and affordable. Highly recommended.John P..I rally wanted to like this venue. Highly recommend by a friend.  Our party of six arrived early on a Saturday evening so the place was very quiet. The piped in music was soft and unobtrusive. Lovely setting. Our server was superb. Very knowledgeable about the menu and how each dish was prepared. The cocktails were excellent.For me it went downhill from there. The Insalata Di Finocchi sounded interesting but was rather flavorless. The Tonnarelli Cacio e Pepe pasta was overcooked and gloppy, not at all memorable. I did taste the Focacce Magherita flatbread which was quite good.Bottom line. Five star service and ambience but I found my dishes ordinary. Others at my table were less critical..Cute this spot in Flatiron. I'd been watching them on Instagram for a while and was impressed by what they showcased. Even though I have to give it 3 stars, there was a lot to like about this spot. We made a reservation on Open Table. I recommend as it was full from the time we arrive until we left. We started at the bar while we waited for our table. It's busy and took a little while to get our drinks. The cocktail menu is big and the pictures are as picturesque as they look on Instagram.  I had the Citriolo. It was light and refreshing. Nothing exceptional. I'd say the price is a bit high for a good, but very normal cocktail in NYC. When we moved to our table, our server was exceptional. She was attentive, shared recommendations and never felt like we were being rushed. To start, we ordered the burrata with prosciutto and the octopus. The burrata was delicious! I'm not an octopus fan, but my party said it was also delicious. They also give you bread with a dipping oil to hold you over while you browse the menu. We ordered a variety of pastas for dinner including the special of the night the squid ink gnocchi. This is where it falls flat. The pastas were okay. Maybe even a little underwhelming. Wish so many good pasta options in the city, this one will not stand out. I think I'll skip the mains next time, but can see myself going back for a cocktail and an appetizer..This place was very memorable. Unfortunately it was memorable for being one of the top worst dining experiences I've had in NYC. It pains me to say it. No one greeted us when we walked in. Left standing there like idiots for a while. Host was running huge trays of drinks instead. Finally sat. Again ignored forever. Server knew nothing about the menu. Lots of empty glasses around the restaurant. Asked busboy for utensils, he returned & awkwardly just handed them to me lol! (Like no napkin, or tray, or placement.) Then the food. It was actually so bad. First time in like a decade I've sent food back, but had no choice. Pasta with sausage & mozzarella. It was like a yellow drenched Mac & cheese out of a box w/ a sprinkle of sausage. My date & I both couldn't eat it. Took so long for them to notice, we just sent it back & left hungry. They offered nothing to make it right. I hate writing bad reviews. But def won't be returning..I made last minute reservations here with two friends, and let me tell you, we were happy! You have to try the pappardelle. It is amazing! The gnocchi was great too. These two were solid items. The wine list was also good too. The service was prompt and professional. Definitely would come back again!.I've been coming to Bocca for years, from back when it used to be all dark inside and was a great place to escape the office for a catch up with a friend and where you wouldn't bump into any other co-workers! Always enjoyed the tuna sandwich at lunch. Dinner is more expensive, so it's not my first choice for pasta but ended up going this week for restaurant week and as usual everything was great. Firstly, the tomato dipping sauce they give you with the bread is amazing, it has never changed in all the years I have been going and I really hope it doesn't! For dinner I had the eggplant (delicious) and branzino (thought was small but was actually a perfect portion and very flavorful). It's a great place, and glad it still is doing well after all these years..I had an amazing ladies night dinner here! From the moment you walk in, there is an incredible aesthetic and chill vibe. We got lots of dishes and shared and what stood out for me was the cauliflower in cream sauce, the pasta was honestly the freshest I've had in years and the calamari and dipping sauces were delicious. Amazing service and will definitely be going there with friends and family soon!.We booked at this place via recommendation of opentable.com and this place truly exceeded our expectations. We arrived slightly early for our dinner and decided to have some cocktails at the bar. Yes, you read that right, bar seating is allowed again in NYC. I then have a Toronto; gin-based cocktail and my partner had a Spritz so fitting for mid-May weather.We were then told by the maître d that our indoor table is ready. We started with a complimentary home bread and olive oil followed by focacce parma; homemade mozzarella, prosciutto de parma, tomato sauce, and rucola. It was delicious and the portion is perfect for 2 people.For our entree, I chose fettuccine con Funghi e crema de Tartufo or homemade fettuccine with wild mushrooms and black truffle sauce while my partner chose pappardelle al ragu di Agnello; homemade ribbon pasta with tomato's braised lamb shank and pecorino romano. Both dishes are freshly made and delicious it suited well with our choices of quartino of wine (size of 2 glasses serving).We then capped the night with Sicilian lemon tart to share. This place serves solid Italian dishes, we both enjoyed the efficient customer service, definitely a neighborhood gem!.NYC has its share of Italian restaurants and Bocca is one of the upscale offerings.  Here you start off with a cocktail or even go for a martini - why not?  I asked for mine extra dirty (oh no).  The pastas are good I ordered the cacio e Pepe and with the added fresh pepper was satisfying.  The restaurant can get crowded and the staff are efficient maybe even too efficient. Upscale comes at a cost particularly if you booze it up..Bocca Cucina and Bar Ratings: 3.6/5Food: 3/5 - I was not impressed by the food, especially the free bread was disappointing. It was stale and hard, probably the worse I have had at an Italian restaurant, not a fan. For the first course, we started with the caprese (fresh mozzarella and tomatoes) along with the meatballs. I would recommend the meatballs; it was tasty, delicious, and super flavorful, very tender and juicy as well. For entrees, we both ordered pasta. The homemade pasta with tomato braised lamb shank blew my mind. Pasta was chewy and al dente topped with the tomato braised lamb, great combo and fresh ingredients. Exceeded my expectations and what saved this category of ratings. The flavors were on point and it was perfect. The orecchiette pasta with clams was actually really bland, and I had to add a decent amount of salt for flavors. I did not like the texture of the pasta at all. It was very doughy, and not chewy at all. Desserts were pretty average, they definitely lack the wow moment for me. Taste like store bought desserts, especially the sliced pineapple on top of the coconut panna cotta taste like it literally came straight from a pineapple juice can. I would say fresh strawberries or blueberries on top of the panna cotta would elevated it so much more. Ambiance: 4/5 - Bar area looks great and chill. Interior is pretty and classy with good interior decorations. It is also pretty dark and dimly-lit It was actually pretty quiet inside, so this would be a good place for a date night. Outdoor seating is pretty solid, recommend to sit outside when the weather is nice. Price: 3.5/5 - We went for restaurant week, so it was $39 per person before tax and tips. The portion was good, and we were pretty full after the meal, but I just wished that the quality of the orecchiette pasta and the desserts to be better. It will made the experience a lot better. Service: 4/5 - Typical customer service at a restaurant and nothing too special. Our server was great, and I like how energetic and enthusiastic he was when taking our orders and recommending dishes to us. However, there wasn't a good system in place. There are other servers that came by and took our bills and orders, so there was a lot of confusion between us and our server that was taking care of us. BLUF: I will not return again. It was a good experience for restaurant week, but there's much better restaurant to try out for some authentic Italian food. If you do want to stop by, order the meatballs and the tomato braised lamb shank pasta. Please skip the desserts."
"Beautiful hotel and very convenient location. It's close to all of the subways and also the Staten Island ferry. Battery park is nearby which is awesome because you can see the Statue of Liberty! The hotel itself is very clear. All of the staff were nice, warm, welcoming, and friendly. The breakfast staff could have been nicer but they did clean up a lot. The breakfast was not quickly restocked with food which was annoying. The milk was also warm! Nasty. The room was a nice size and it was perfect for my husband and I. I would definitely visit this hotel again if I were to visit NYC!.stayed for 4 nights on a recent business trip. I had asked for housekeeping service every day, and I didn't receive it once despite following up every evening when I got back to my room to see it was unserviced. I ran out of bathroom tissue and went downstairs to the front desk to get a new roll and was told they didn't have any and was given TISSUE PAPER instead.Aside from that, the room was run down with an old and springy mattress and an absolutely filthy in-room coffee machine, and the coffee and hot water downstairs was luke-warm at best.I paid $300 a night for this room. I travel quite extensively for business and this was easily the worst hotel experience I can remember. Dont stay here!!.This Hampton Inn is squeezed in downtown in the buildings looks like it was reconstructed from another location that used to be there. It had a decent breakfast but again all the spaces seem small there was one elevator that took forever. The room seemed cramped but the location was very convenient to the financial district downtown area..My stay at Hampton Inn Manhattan/downtown financial district was subpar. There was a leak under the bathroom sink that couldn't be repaired. They offered to change my room, but my cat had already acclimated to that one. I didn't want to further disturb him since we had spent hours on the road prior to checking in. Unfortunately the leak was not my biggest concern. On my third day I noticed my cats ears twitching none stop, he also seemed agitated and uncomfortable. Despite having one more night there, I ended up leaving in fear that my cat was having a negative reaction to being in an unknown place too long. The following day I took my cat to the vet where he was diagnosed with having ear mites which he caught at the hotel. I was completely devastated and disgusted. Aside from that there was also some animal cruelty taking place in front of the hotel. A man was kicking and punching his dog. I interfered and threatened to call the cops. I then asked the concierge if that man was a guest and he wasn't sure. He also added the reason he didn't interfere or do something was because it wasn't taking place in hotel property. This angered me, I feel something more should've been done by the employees. Lastly they have a 1 hour gym policy and it's by appointment. I understand and respect their policy, however there was nobody else on schedule for the gym that day and I was told I will have to go back up after the hour to make an appointment and get a new key. I felt rushed and couldn't quite get a great workout because I was limited to an hour even though there was nobody on the schedule but me. overall I wouldn't come here again especially not with one of my pets..Bedbugs :( stay away. despite seeming very clean. and wasn't refunded. kind staff but rude GM. no one followed up with me about the experience either..Horrible experience.Booked a day room to get some rest after the redeye flight.The lady at check in was extremely rude. We were visibly tired and she made us wait in the lobby for 30 minutes until her ""shift"" started to check us in. A couple of hours in, loud hammering started. And I mean loud! Nobody bothered to tell us they were doing remodeling on the floor. So needless to say we didn't get any sleep. Just stay away from this place..Cute place Yes it's small but convenient. We stayed one night for our date night and the place was perfect for what I wanted . I needed a place close to tribeca and preferably with Breakfast . This place was perfect around the corner from the 1 train . In a safe cute area . The customer service was amazing . The bed was a king extremely comfortable and clean .  Breakfast was delicious . A nice variety of breads , cereals , waffles , eggs and juices . Fresh coffee and the paper where my way of walking out with a smile . I purchased the romantic package with wine and chocolates . Nothing fancy or romantic so I would probably definitely skip that . I recommend you kill a rose or something on the bed  .  Make it seem a little more romantic . The price difference wasn't much so I can't complain . Over all I would definitely return.Amazing right off the bat! COVID friendly proper precautions set in place 6 feet markers and not to mention I was bleeding from a wound I had encountered at another property . The manager was great! Even offered me a first aid kit and bandages! Great service and great staff so far . No wonder their occupancy rate is still 30 to 40 percent and they can afford to keep their prices where their at. Keep it up!.Stayed here pre cruise, and couldn't be happier. Rode the MegaBus from Boston and it dropped us street side at 27th and 7th. We took the 1 Subway to the South Ferry stop. Up the escalator toThe street and it's a short 2.5 block walk to the hotel. Not a problem, even with cruise luggage in tow. Check in was easy, tea and coffee in the lobby. The room was clean and appropriately appointed. Not the biggest hotel room I have seen, but hey, it's NYC!  The bathroom was great and the shower head could have sandblasted a rusty Studebaker bumper. Included breakfast was good with eggs, meat, oatmeal, waffles, dry cereal, yogurts, pastries, etc. All you could need. The proximity to the Subway and Staten Island Ferry is a huge plus. Don't hesitate to book..Clean facility and nice staff. We arrived at 9:30AM. Check in is 3PM. So we pre checked in. Gave her our credit cards and checked our bags at the desk. Returned at 3:30PM and were told that our rooms were still not ready. Pretty disappointing.Edit: we didn't get access to our room until 4:45PM and consequently almost missed a prepaid reservation at Del Posto which almost cost me $250 for a no show. Lucky for us we could get changed and make it to the restaurant only 10 minutes past our reservation. Came back to this shit-tel and were in our rooms only 12 minutes and the fire alarm went off. 40 degrees outside   Never never never stay here. Ignore me at your own peril."
"Great place ! Food is fresh and taste very good ! Great place for a quick lunch or you can sit and enjoy it . Owners are very friendly and always smiling . They also have made to order sandwiches , burgers , wraps salads . I recommend you go and try it out ! You will thank me later !.Had a restaurant.com gift certificate for $10 off at food cave and they did not honor it. Buffet was only half full.  Will not go back.Stopped by twice for lunch and once for breakfast. Hot buffet style. $5.99 per lb with a free can of soda. Ordered my pbj right before work and it took about 15 min. They made my pbj at min 14. Why? The store needs a better management at their workflow. The cashier line as well as the waiting area is a chaos. Ppl trying to pass and get through one another either due to waiting for their food, trying to pay or trying to get food from the buffet stand. If the spacing is bigger prob will def solve the issues.  Buffet Food was just ok. Not even hot, it's more towards the cold side. Had some rotisserie chickens, meatball, curry chicken, rice and spaghetti. As far as coffee- many varieties: French vanilla, Columbia, hazelnut, etc but why no decaf?.The tacos here are great. If you're in this area, get their tacos. It's really good and you won't be disappointed. I was pleasantly surprised and it's cheap too. But before you go make sure you check their business hours..Praying I don't get sick from having just eaten here. This place is straight up nasty. The buffet food is sketchy as hell. On Saturdays it's only half full! That was a bad sign by itself. There's few other places to eat around here so I guess that's how they stay in business. But my advice, take a walk to somewhere decent, or eat here and roll the dice. Nasty..This is probably my favorite restaurant in the area. Food is delicious and service is very good. Would highly recommend.First step when running a business, treat ALL customers equally. This rat traps/ roach nest is one of the worst establishments I have ever walked into. It is so cramped and unorganized. A few co-workers have gotten sick from eating in here. I was standing second in line to get a cup of coffee, keep in mind I walked pass 2 other places only because this restaurant is closer to my job, the manager skips me to help the 2 women standing behind me. He has done this before, but I guess today was my lucky day. I don't care who your regulars are, there is a line for a reason. With that being said, my money will stay in my pocket. Customers don't need you, you need them..I was here late afternoon, they stop lunch menu like around 4pm. Little disappointed as the dinner me u is much more expensive.  Buffet food, found it to be too dried and avoid the jerk chicken at all cost super spicy, unable to tolerate.  Try it at your own risk :).I go to this place fairly often and it's a solid experience every time. Their chicken wings which normally comes in honey bbq, regular bbq, Thai chili, and chicken Parmesan are hands down one of the best wings I've ever had. I love their mango smoothie especially for the price! Their buffet menu is pretty extensive and there's also a great selection of salads and sandwiches that can be ordered. If you're not sure what you're in the mood for this is the place to come to because something will surely  catch your eye!.Quick and efficient. They change up the menu which is good. The wings and the jerk chicken are delicious"
"Cute space, great coffee, King David Tacos, fast service, convenient location on Flatbush. What more could you need? Had a large almond milk latte, and it got me wired for hours! They also sell whole beans (from Stumptown)..I went to Hungry Ghost with a friend as a starting point for a walk. Full disclaimer, I don't drink coffee, but as someone who feels hopelessly in the minority of adults I am occasionally open to a coffee shop meet where I know the only viable option for me will likely be hot cocoa. Well, I ordered one and honestly, it tasted kind of like any coffee shop hot cocoa I've had, kind of bitter (like dark chocolatey? I don't like dark chocolate at all) and not smooth enough. Like the problem could be too little cocoa or too little sugar. Either way, for me it was nothing special, but if you're a coffee lover, obvious your mileage has a lot more potential for variation.PS- When are coffee places gonna start keeping lactose free milk on hand? No love for us!.This is a terrible place to do work. They have WiFi, but it's slow. And they literally don't have any outlets. They went so far as to tape over and lock plates covering what used to be outlets. Wtf..AMAZING !! First time here and the customer service was exceptional and the coffee was even better than expected !!!! the lattes were sooo smooth and silky & the cappuccinos were great too ! They are following social distancing inside as well , so it wasn't crowded at all. They were fast in getting the orders ready and the desserts look good too. Definitely my go to coffee house when im in park slope..This place was the BOMB before COVID and it's still the best, the coffee is amaze balls..Using Covid as am excuse to close bathrooms is a lake trend. Doing this at a coffee place is especially lame. Doing so at a coffee place that charges top dollar scores you a shiny single star!.I was a dreary, decaffeinated ghost until I came here to return to the land of the living as a happy human. You can hear the spooky voice, saying ""reeeeeallaaax"" through the walls. (Not really, Hungry Ghost usually plays mellow R&B, chill pop, or sweet 00's hip hop - where are you now my dear Ne-Yo?)~Whole milk cortado is thick and flavorful~Iced coffee is delicious~Iced Matcha Latte, if you like matte, is yummy and grassy ~Salted Peanut Butter is the perfect amount of soft and crumbly and potently peanut buttery *A highlight*Baristas have always been kind!Bring your laptop weekdays 11am-4pm but otherwise, expect to not find a spot with your machine, and enjoy the ambiance - live edge cedar tables, dark wood, light walls, filament bulbs and exposed brick as you listen to 2011 Adele. Reeeelllaaaaaax.Delicious chai latte - muted sweetness was appreciated. The size of the latte was perfect large enough to last while reading a few chapters of my book. Hungry Ghost is spacious and was a lovely place to read for an afternoon. The ample table space makes this place a great location in which to work..Great coffee (using Stumptown beans) and I love how they offer oat milk here in addition to whole, almond, and soy. The cafe also serves up a variety of baked goods and light sandwiches during the day, though when I arrived on a Sunday afternoon, they were all out of hot croissants/sandwiches. My friend highly recommended the ham and cheese croissant, so I'll have to give it a try next time..I usually go for the cheapest coffee, from a bagel cart or deli - partially due to convenience and partially because it annoys me to pay so much extra for haut café. But a few times I have ended up in Hungry Ghost, because I'm running late or forgot to get coffee closer to home, and each time I am surprised anew: Oh! This stuff really is better!Yes, it costs almost exactly twice as much as coffee from the bagel cart. But it's coffee that's actually worth drinking and experiencing.I would downgrade them for the price, but the truth is they are charging a fair price for a superior product. If I compare their pricing to their true peers, they suddenly look very reasonable - maybe even a bargain. So I won't complain that the Lexus costs more than the Hyundai. Compared to the BMW, it looks pretty good..I usually go for the cheapest coffee, from a bagel cart or deli - partially due to convenience and partially because it annoys me to pay so much extra for haut café.

"There's a Hungry Ghost in Tribeca! I visited the Brooklyn locations and was surprised to see one right by where I commute to work. It's setup is very similar to the cafe that was previously here. This corner space has a lot of natural light, making the cafe well lit. There's easy to grab snack on the left side of the cafe and baked goods by the counter. There are no actual tables but there are ledges with high chairs that you can sit and eat. I ordered a latte and it was to my liking of what I consider the perfect balance of milk and espresso. All staff were super friendly and ready to take your order! Stamp cards available per beverage. Excited to come back another time..Not consistent at all. There are days the coffee is amazing & other days when it taste like Dunkin' Donuts coffee. - Staff is friendly - Always crowded unless you come early in the morning (7am)- breakfast option are good but taste mediocre I've slowly started to dislike Hungry Ghost, it's becoming a game of roulette when determining if your gonna get a good cup of coffee or not"
"The roast beef sandwich legend of south Brooklyn. Don't get me wrong RnR is amazing for late nights, they take cards and they have a more extensive menu.... But when you're in the mood for a roast beef sandwich without all the frills and you've got actual cash on you (they don't take credit/debit) you come to the legendary Brennan and Carr. Fries, onion rings, amazing clam chowder, roast beef sandwiches served on a pillowy roll. Ask for it dipped and pay to get a bowl of that incredible broth on the side. Dunk your sandwich in it for at least 3 seconds till it's soaked. It'll be an orgasmic experience in your mouth. I guarantee it. Draft beers include a no fuss no muss bud and bud light. They have other bottle beers. We got Heineken because we like tasting our beer ;-)Service is super quick and no frills. Get the roast beef sandwich rare , with onions, dipped with a side of gravy. Get fries with cheese on the side, an order of onion rings, and if you're especially hungry, New England clam chowder and possibly mozzarella sticks. Best damn lunch/dinner you've ever had..Ahhh Brennan and Carr. Right in my own back yard. How have I not written a formal review yet?Of course they get 5 stars. Why you ask?Because their roast beef sammies are LEGENDARY. they're served piping hot dunked in beef au jus. Get the meat dunked? Yes!Get the sandwich dunked? Yes!Get au jus ladled over the top? YES!!!Gargioulo burger? Roast beef inside a hamburger Fries are piping hotClam chowder? Get it Chicken sandwich? Get it. Onion rings?  Get it!Honestly everything here is great. Service is fast and friendly. Just keep in mind. CASH ONLY!.I'd been to Roll-N-Roaster dozens of times before trying the old-school Brennan & Carr's.Brennan & Carr's is truly a gem stuck in time; as you walk in, you can see the vintage architecture and stained-glass windows transporting you back to the restaurant's glory days. Classic menus and cash-only signs are displayed near the entrance. My guests and I ordered Roast Beef Sandwiches with Cheese, as well as sides of fries and onion rings. The finger foods were decent, but the hot roast beef sandwiches were out of this world! The flavor, let alone the quality of the roast beef, surpasses Roll-N-Roaster. However, a word of caution--the gravy, while tasty, is quite watery in texture and turns the untoasted rolls into a mushy mess. My best advice is to use hundreds of napkins, request lite gravy, or request for the gravy to be placed on the side (somehow) because you'll end up with a sloppy mess!Overall, the roast-beef sandwiches are excellent, which is to be expected given the restaurant's reputation! The service was great--the waiter was highly attentive and cordial. Unfortunately, while there is a parking lot behind the restaurant, it only holds about eight cars, making parking a bit of a hassle. Nevertheless, the restaurant is a true Brooklyn landmark that should be frequented. I highly urge you to check them out!.What can I say... it's Brennan & Carr. I've know of this place since I was a young man, it's an icon and destination for all real foodies. I just never had the opportunity to go. I've even dreamed of going into Brooklyn just to say I've been there. Finally I had my chance, driving home from a Long Island customer visit I detoured off the Belt Parkway and made my way. Good thing I chose that day because I just skated under the vaccine ID mandate in NYC. I'm vaccinated I just didn't have proof with me. I got a sandwich and side dip and went to town. People, if you are reading this and have never been there just plan a trip and go. You can drive, they have a parking lot which is more rare that a tree in Brooklyn..No much 2 say besides WOW if ya lookin for AMAZING roast beef ya don't have to anymore this spot is a 100% must for any tourist and if your from Brooklyn why haven't ya been here yet!!!!!!!!.Only rating this based on this specific sandwich.  I do want to say that i've eaten here many times as a kid and normally this is 5 stars.  This rating is  based solely on takeout that then traveled 2 hours before I got it.  And it's STILL 4 stars.I have many good memories with my Father here so for that alone I am so happy that this place is still around.  For the area the prices are decent and (when open inside) a nice place to grab a small meal.  They are however, my 2nd favorite place to get a Roast Beef in the general area...I won't say the first hahaSo this sandwich traveled to the Poconos and was still hot and delicious when I got it.  The roll wasn't destroyed (got my au jus on the side to dip rather than get it dipped there) and the meat was as excellent as I ever remember it being.  What else can you say?  If you're from the area...then you already know.  If you're not, get in there and find out..Cuisine: 1Service: 6Decor: 5Value: 5Overall: 4I know this has been a neighborhood treasure for decades, and maybe it was a gem at some point, but clearly those days are in the rear view mirror.In the past, my friends and I have dined here and thought it was okay, but not worth the hype at all. However, I drove by yesterday and decided to get a roast beef sandwich, double dipped. What I got was a nearly stall roll with really tough slices of roast beef in between, and barely any au jus. Totally unsatisfactory.What the hell was that? I understand why they are only doing takeout, but your standards should be kept. I ate it immediately in their parking lot in hopes that the roast beef won't become overcooked ... ... too late! Not sure what else to say except I wish there were still Roy Rogers near where I live. Hahaha.Holy Roast Beef-ol-ey!It is about a 20 minute walk from the Avenue U station on the Q train, so if you are worried about accessibility to public transit, it will not present a problem. Plus, it is a fairly straight walk. Simply walk up about 12 blocks to Nostrand Ave and it is right there!To compare this with Roll-N-Roaster is like comparing cheese and cabbage. They are both food, but they are definitely not alike otherwise, save for almost identical menus. The roast beef sandwich here is so good, so juicy, so wet, and it is piled high with goodness. Even the roll it is served on is dipped in juices (they call it hot broth) to make the whole thing a sinful treat. I still find it hard to believe I finished one of these. The cheese layer is a bit amateur, and it does not melt into the meat; it still adds plenty of flavor to an already insane sandwich.As they do not accept credit cards, that is all that I got. When I return (and I hope that is soon), I will get myself a bowl of their clam chowder with the sandwich to create the perfect harmony of savoriness. Now you have no excuse not to give Brennan & Carr a go!.Brennan & Carr continues to rock it and I'll love this place forever.  Opting for the crispy chicken sandwich of late, I went old school yesterday and indulged in the double dipped au jus roast beef sandwich.  Absolutely amazing in its simplicity and nothing can ever compare. #ThankYouThursday2021.A Brooklyn institution.   Of course the roast beef sandwich drenched in au jus and onion rings are simply delicious.  Tonight I discovered how amazing the cheeseburgers are!  You can tell they use a very high quality of meat.  The burgers are cooked to perfection and are scrumptious.  I'm also a fan of B&C's apple pie.  This is comfort food at its finest..They have the BEST fries. I live a few blocks from Roll n Roaster- they don't got nothing on Brennan & Carrs..I'm not a big fan of roast beef because it's usually super dry, but my sandwich was super moist! I love that they give you an option to have the beef broth on the side and you can just dip your sandwich in it. The staff is super friendly! The onion rings tasted okay, they were nice and crunchy. The apple pie was yummy! It came warm and paired really well with the ice cream."
"This has to be one of the best sushi restaurants in queens hands down.i didn't know about about this restaurant until recently when my wife introduced me to it .she has been coming here for some time now.and this is one of her favorite sushi spots .there food has a good taste to it and is prepared well also.Great spot for all you sushi lovers ,and you wont break the bank. The place is well kept and the staff is courteous..Love this spot.  It is conveniently located near queens court .   They are pleasant and treat city workers well.    Great spot for lunch..We decided to give Sushi Koi another chance. We placed an order for pick up and were told it would be ready in 10 minutes. We walked in in 15 minutes and still had to wait another 15 minutes but at least it was made in front of our eyes. We had the Three Hero Roll, Red Dragon roll, one tuna/avocado hand-roll and two miso soups. The soup was delicious, not too salty, good amount of tofu and seaweed. Very flavorful. Three Hero was really good but the other rolls, Red Dragon and hand roll, were both bland..I live close-by but since it always looked empty, I thought it's not a good sign and continually skipped it.Last week we gave it the first try. It was late evening and we just wanted something small. We shared a miso soup and each of us had a sushi (spicy salmon and salmon crunch) roll. We were pleasantly surprised and thought to come again, in spite of a slow service (only one more table/2 ppl dinning in).I decided to give it another try. This time with my daughter. 3 sushi rolls, 2 hand rolls and 2 miso. $25. The rolls were good, fresh. It took forever to get the soups. Service was even more horrendous this time. The waiter was much more interested in his cellphone or was sitting with his colleague at a table at the other end, not once checking on his clients. In conclusion, the food was good. If we ever give them another chance it will be for delivery (the only sushi delivered to my area), mostly because of their prices. If they ever raise it, we're definitely done..Horrible service. Placed an order for pick up before noon, saying we would pick up at 1. When we got there they sent out a small child to tell us it would be another half hour, when we finally got an adult to come out she was very rude and basically said they didn't even start making the food, they just expected us to sit outside and wait for a half hour, you can't come into the restaurant right not just FYI. Don't order from here..I got the two-rolls lunch special takeout. I ordered the avocado roll and eel avocado with miso soup. The avocado is fresh and the eel is delicious.   Everything is nicely packed and the price is affordable..Horrible nasty give u what they want not what you ordered don't like to give refund disgusting.I have to say Sushi Koi is not one of the top cheap sushi spots in Queens nor is it the most inviting place to dine. I come here only when I am craving sushi and in a rush to get home from work. It's a block away from the E/F train on Union Tpke station. The restaurant is usually pretty dimly lit and empty. Almost every time I come, it's on a weeknight and there are kids (assuming the owners kids) doing homework or riding a small bike around the restaurant. Definitely feel like they could use a renovation here. The fish is alright though, but I always question how fresh it is since it's never busy in here. But hey, I haven't gotten sick from eating here yet! *knocks on wood.Came here after work with my work friends and had a pleasure. The place is actually pretty small but since we came around 9:30/10:00PM and there were only two other tables. By the time we left, we were the only table. The sushi was definitely better than expected, especially for ""all you can eat"". Will definitely come back for ""all you can eat."".There is one person working as waiter, host, and delivery person. Sushi itself was good, but not worth the long wait. I was told my food would be ready in 20 minutes and ended up waiting an hour..This spot is close to my job so I generally come for lunch during the week. At this time there is usually just one woman taking all the orders, bringing out the food and taking payments. She's fast, but if the restaurant is crowded, there will be a wait. The prices are reasonable, especially the lunch specials and the food comes out quickly. It's good sushi. I usually get the three roll combo that comes with a soup or salad. Some of my co-workers get the bento boxes and say they're good. Nice spot for lunch if you're in the area."
"After the chicken teriyaki lunch bento I had from here, I plan never to return. The salad was just a little bit of lettuce with an overly vinegary dressing, the teriyaki was inexplicably spicy, which all but drowned out any other flavor there might have been. Even their rice was off (undercooked). At least the miso soup was alright and the shumai weren't bad. I called my order ahead but had to wait ten minutes on top of the fifteen that had passed after I placed my order."
"Great atmosphere, good latte. I had their Greek yogurt & granola bowl too, which was so so. My intent was to go there to study & it would've been a great place to do so if they had wifi... Server told me it was ""broken,"" which I wish I would've known before I ordered $16 worth of food & coffee.My boyfriend and I met some friends here for lunch today and it was a fantastic atmosphere with plenty of large tables for our group. I had the avocado toast with an added fried egg, and my boyfriend had the cauliflower tahini sandwich. The avocado toast had both large chunks of avocado and more creamy avocado as well, which was a nice balance. The egg was cooked perfectly and the feta was an excellent complement. My only complaint would be that it was a bit hard to cut through the toast with the knife provided as it was very hard.My boyfriend's sandwich was very good as well. It was a decent size and full of flavor.Overall, this is a great spot to meet friends, work, study, or just enjoy a nice cup of coffee/breakfast!.I put three stars but this place is more of a three and a half. I came here to get some work done. Really nice and spacious environment with plenty of seating and outlets. However, the WiFi wasn't working which is a bit of a bummer. I ordered a Chai Latte with Almond Milk and my friend ordered a Matcha Latte which had a nice presentation. Chai Latte came out plain looking, but tasted nice with a good amount of cinnamon so no complaints there. Matcha Latte is a good unsweetened latte which I like, but others might not so just giving anyone reading this the heads up..Fast casual cafe offering Mediterranean food and good coffee. They take the orders at the counter and bring the food to you. We got the food very quickly (so good if you're in a rush). All three dishes we had tasted decent and yummy, just not the highest quality or best if you're going for uniqueness or quality. A bit of shame they put refined sugar in the eggplant salad and cauliflower sandwich pepper spread so my husband couldn't eat it. Oat milk latte was good, just milk was steamed super hot..What a great location! I really love every Gotan location I've tried but this one definitely stands out with its cute outdoor seating area. Also, the brunch here is delicious - if you want to taste a lot of different things, try the Gotan Breakfast. I got the avocado toast and it was very fresh and filling..This place is pretty typical for Tribeca. Quaint and upscale on the inside. Basically a gentrified Panera. Food was pretty solid. Had the Mediterranean chicken sandwich on a crispy baguette with great flavoring. It came with an over-dressed salad unfortunately. Worth $15.50? Probably not..The vibes at Gotan are literally impeccable. It is such a cute little space that is perfect for WFH, which I have been doing for the past month. Gotan has large wooden tables for big groups to hang out, and smaller cafe-styled tables with outlets for studying. The entire place lets in alot of sunlight, and has a nice wood and greenery aesthetic, which is comforting and cozy. My slight complaint is that the wifi is not the fastest, but its still great if you're doing light work. The iced mocha I got was also very chocolatey and yummy, which I enjoyed. I got the Gotan breakfast, which was delicious. I thought that it might not be filling enough, but I was thoroughly stuffed until dinner. The tomato and cucumber mix was very flavorful, and the potatoes were well spiced. My friend got a tuna salad, which also had large portions and didn't skimp on the tuna. The food came out very fast and the staff was all super helpful! I would highly recommend coming here to enjoy a pleasant afternoon of reading and relaxing..The Chicken Shawarma Salad is a unique take on an old favorite. Warm, flavorful, and healthy - I wish I could eat this salad every day..I came here to catch up with a friend on a Saturday afternoon. I loved that they had plenty of outdoor seating and we had no trouble finding a spot quickly.I decided to order an iced latte with almond milk and a tuna sandwich for lunch. The food came  out very quickly which was great. I really enjoyed the iced matcha latte because it wasn't too sweet but also didn't taste watery. The tuna sandwich wasn't presented very well and was just ok. The bread was a bit tough but the actual tuna and the inside of the sandwich was pretty good.I would definitely come back just because it has a great outdoor setting with plenty of space, but I would probably try something else on the menu..Love. Great environment and delicious food. Cheddar biscuit was so good + iced matcha."
"Oh My Freaking Gosh.Rows of gorgeous and unusual leather handbags (I'm a bag snob, sorry) in bright colours.  Kate Spade, eat dirt.  Well, maybe just eat crow since the price tags on these marvelous morsels of leather warrant homelessness for a month.  I can at least afford Kate Spade and still eat (well maybe frank and beans, but at least something.)Service was fine for a high end shop like this - the shopgirl was definitely foreign and a little aloof, but I was okay with that..I really love this place, their handbags and jewelry are extremely well made. Everything is very unique and opulent, bags unlike any in soho. I have had bags made by Jamin Puech for over 10 years, and the necklace I bought there is one of a kind, made of vintage French casino pieces. Visit this place just to look at their beautiful merchandise, and buy something if it's in your budget!!!!!.Gorgeous, unique bags.  The prices are high, but the sale pricing (up to 80% off) makes them more reasonable.  A little luxury that is practical for everyday living..I used to walk by this store and always admire and liked the design of these bags until I got one bag there 2 weeks ago and the bag broke right away!!! I wore the bag twice and first the button broke and then the handle completely came off!!!!! ridiculous!!!! just bad quality and bad design and customer service just terrible.  The manager of the soho store, Donna, could not help me or exchange the bag because I bought it on sale, now keep in mind that a sale in this store means I still paid a good amount for this bag and you would think that they would want to keep a customer happy so that she would come back and buy again next season, but instead decided to send me an email saying that the ""management"" decided that there was nothing they could do for me since I wanted no repairs in my bag.  Why would i want repairs on a bag that was defective since the moment I bought it???.  These people stole my money and fooled me.  At the end I got no bag and wasted my $$$$. The way that this store and brand are doing business is just wrong and it will not last for too long!!! I will NEVER buy there again and make sure everyone knows what a horrible brand they are and poor quality in their designs!"
"The Sparrow is back, and, we thought, as good as ever. He loved his steak sandwich, but my made-in-house veggie burger was terrific, we really enjoyed the crispy brussels sprouts, and our cocktails, too. Best of all is they play the only good music playlist I think I ever hear in Astoria. A great hang..I've been here twice and both times the drinks have been alright but the bartender is insufferable. If you don't like working with people, find another job sir..I really liked The Sparrow Tavern... We came last Friday night and it was super trendy, the draft list looked great, and the food menu looked even better. It's right around the house from my house, which is the biggest perk of them all. Sparrow Tavern is understated, low-key, no frills. The prices are decent and you have a great meal. The service on a Friday was a little light - one server had about 10 tables, so that made the turnarounds a bit slow on drinks, etc. but overall great spot. For food we went with wings, and I had the falafel sandwich for my meal. We also got a side of tater tots. As spot that has tots is fab in my little black book.PS since moving to Astoria I've been all about the falafel. It's bomb. BLESS UP..One of my favorite places in Queens for brunch! Honestly, anything you order it's simply delicious. The only thing I do have to say, is that they charge you for everything. Sides? Charge. Cheese? Charge. Bacon? Charge. Napkins? Charge (JK) but they do charge you for every little add on. Their coffee is really good, not sure where they get it from but every time I always make sure to order a cappuccino or latte. My favorite dish is their veggie burger. YES, their veggie burger. Their veggie burger is not like your typical patty.. it's simply amazing and it comes with this spicy mustard on the side. This is the only place where I'll order a veggie burger. It's never really packed, which is fairly weird given that most places in Astoria are packed on the weekends. The ambiance is very rustic and homey. Their staff is super friendly and attentive. The place itself is fairly small so it's pretty intimate. Deff a place worth checking out, if you're looking for a new brunch spot in Astoria. It's also super close to Astoria Park!.Definitely a great brunch stable in Astoria Queens. One of our best go to spots in Astoria! I Got the chicken Tinga again and it does not disappoint!The service can be a bit slow and it's a tarvern so not the cleanest or classiest place that's why it's only 4 starBut I would come back again.Charming bar with a not so charming manager. Beware the ramen-headed Tea Nazi. I used to enjoy Sparrow when I lived in the neighborhood. It has always been a little overpriced but the food and vibe were good. Unfortunately, I had one of the most uncomfortable experiences with the manager who was beyond rude to us for no reason. We stopped in around 7 PM last night to and it was pretty slow. It was cold out and I had a tea I needed to finish.I asked the friendly blonde server if it was OK if. She said it was no problem and we thanked her for her flexibility. We are perusing the bar menu when a middle aged woman with a nose ring (TN) informs me that I will have to throw it out. Her tone is nasty to say the least. I calmly tell her that I'm almost done with it, we're ordering cocktails, and that the other server said it was OK to finish. TN Narrows her eyes with absolute contempt and says ""Who told you THAT? Someone who's NOT THE MANAGER?"" as she darts a dirty look between myself and the offending server. I probably looked at her like she was crazy because she was acting just that. Look, I've worked in the service industry. I understand that dealing with people sucks but I cannot emphasize enough that we were polite and calm despite her obvious hostility over something so petty. The other server sheepishly apologized for the manager's rudeness but it was not her fault at all and I honestly feel bad for the employees who have to work with such a rude and unreasonable person.I would say the final straw came when I got my teeny cocktail. An Aperol spritz is usually served in a pretty sizable wine glass and for $13 it was a pitiful amount. At this point, they already had our business and it was cold out so I resigned myself to a couple of rounds. TN called me ""sweetie"" a few times which gave me full body ick. -_- I wanted to burn some sage because her vibe was so bad. I understand that I'm not a regular but don't be a dick to your customers if you want them to return..Two words, Brisket Tacos. Hands down the best thing on the menu. I've tried all the tacos, the chicken rings with eggs, bread, and potatoes. The steaks ( regular, and breakfast), chicken pot pie, seasoned fries, and breakfast burger and arugula salad. Everything was a bit bland for my tastebuds. But the brisket tacos were aaaamazing. I would have given a better review but the service was lackluster as well. We went back a second time because I try most places twice before giving them a review. Both times, the brisket tacos were the best, and the rest of the things could use some more seasonings. Even a bit of salt and pepper would work. Something wasn't working for me. Maybe in the future they'll improve but as of now, it's a pass for me..Super Brunch here, highly recommended. I'm English and had the Full English Breakfast, it was better than an English Breakfast, a novel interpretation superbly executed, full marks and complements to the chef.We had Bloody Marys, they were delicious, big and strong.I loved this place, felt like a proper pub. Service was good and the atmosphere easy going and relaxed..This is a solid place to grab some drinks and bites. Sparrow Tavern is very low key, inside and out. The service is always pleasant and attentive without being pushy. Th price is fair, making this tavern a nice place to chill without trying to impress anyone.With the decor of vintage, rescue of mix and match furniture, the place is comfortable. I have been here mostly for brunch time and a few times in the evening for drinks. Everything I have tried on brunch menu are quite delicious, something that I didn't expect in the very beginning. The steak and eggs are solid and filling. The burger is always juicy and probably, truly hand packed since the patty is never overly compacted. The french toast looks quite modest, but it is well executed.... just like everything on the menu. FYI, their hand cut fries with herbs and spices are great to wash down with beer.I wouldn't run to this place, but this is a good option if you are in the area. Personally, I rather drink here than the beer garden... just saying..This hidden gem of a bar/ pub restaurant is amazing!!The menu has a lot of choices vegetarian to meat! The chicken sandwich was delicious and it was able to hold together and the ciabatta roll did not fall apart.The specialty drinks were delicious. I had one of their desserts - I can't remember the name but it was like a sweet French toast soaked in Carmel and cream- so wonderful."
"One of our favorite pizza spots, my husband and I order on the regular, almost once a week. Can't stop, won't stop. We look forward to it every time. The pizza is nearly perfect- just the right amount of ooey gooey delightful cheese, always delivered fresh, we enjoy the toppings, can't go wrong!.At first I was leaning towards rounding up to 4 stars, but I think I will have to lower down to 3 stars. Yes, the slices are big. And they taste good. And the location is great too. But the slice is not memorable. Just a lot of cheese and meh. Not a lot of sauce, the cheese covers the entire slice. It also was pretty floppy which tells me there was some undercooked crust. The crust is mostly cooked; I felt like I was eating hot cheesy bread with a slight hint of tomato. Simply put, I was not feeling it that much. The Buffalo chicken slice is almost the same way. Very hot, and lots of cheese. The chicken on the slice is juicy and flavorful. It looks globby, and in some respect, there are parts of the slice that taste that way too. Just a big mess. Delicious though when you get that marriage of bread and cheese and chicken, but you will be destroying most of the rainforest with how many napkins you will need to eat this. I needed maybe two trees worth.Last note, I strongly recommend getting a Ginger Ale for these slices. Otherwise you will be living in the bathroom for the next half hour.Maybe next time I will try a pasta dish, or stick with one plain slice, maybe..Came here for a quick slice - got the Grandma. Very very good!! Great flavor. Love the tomato sauce and nice crispy crust. I was almost full after the first slice so beware they are big.Only a few bar stools to sit so it's a spot to pick up a slice and walk around Chelsea or get it delivered..I feel bad giving this place 3 stars because it's a small shop right by 14th Street and the service was fine. There was nothing bad about my actual experience there other than the food. I got two slices of plain cheese pizza for $3 a piece and 4 garlic knots for around $1.75. Everything was just bland and lacked flavor. The crust isn't super thin and crispy like I like (personal preference though). The sauce wasn't sweet, it actually had no flavor. The cheese was a little too thick and too chewy. The garlic knots were too doughy and there wasn't enough garlic flavor to it. The marinara sauce we got on the side was the best part. Unfortunately this place didn't satisfy my craving for a simple New York slice of pizza. If you're in the area and really want pizza, you might have better luck with one of the speciality slices..As someone who has completed comprehensive reviews of dozens of New York City's best pizzas, I dont know how Pizza Italia is not much more famous. I was incredibly surprised by this hidden gem on 17th Street. Their slices are massive, delicious, and covered in tons of fresh toppings. Pizza Italia skips nothing and as a result they offer great slices that are surprisingly hard to rival in the city. White Slice (5/5): White Pizza is my favorite so I am very picky about what suffices as a good slice. This exceeded expectations. At Pizza Italia, they understand exactly what needs to be done to make a great White Slice. They use great cheese and plenty of it. This is not a glorified piece of bread. Their crust is great but they let the mozzarella and ricotta dominate the flavor profile of the slice. Buffalo Chicken Slice (5/5): This is the best Buffalo Chicken Slice I have ever had, and I am not usually a big fan of the slice. I was most impressed with their chicken. It comes with the biggest chunks of chicken breast I have ever seen on a pizza. Additionally, they use plenty of cheese and Buffalo sauce. You are getting everything you payed for with this slice. Barbecue Chicken Slice (4/5): This slice was great but was the least impressive of the three. With this slice, I found the sweet barbecue sauce to be overwhelming. It came with the same massive pieces of chicken breast that were on the Buffalo Chicken Slice, only this slice had less cheese and more too much barbecue sauce. It is also a square slice and I much prefer traditional slices. I found the dough to be much better on their traditional slice pizza. It was still good, but it did not impress me as much as the others. If you are looking for one of the best and biggest slices in Manhattan, Pizza Italia is a great option. It now ranks among my favorite places for a fast slice in New York City. There are plenty of more famous options in the city that don't deserve more attention than this unassuming but impressive spot in Chelsea!.I stopped here for a quick slice on my lunch break!!! we split a margarita and a buffalo chicken slice. simply delicious. i will be back!.[delivery review]Grandma pizza - good sauce, very saucy, very cheesy, the crust is a little thicker than I prefer, but solid pizza. Good neighborhood rotation but I wouldn't go out of my way for it..Good pizza but they charge you more than what's displayed on their menu (roughly 12% more). I contemplated getting a second slice, but doing this isn't good business..Grabbed lunch at Pizza Italia on Thursday afternoon. While the Buffalo Chicken Pizza Slice was decent, the traditional Cheese Pizza Slice was a huge disappointment. With other solid pizza options in the area, this would not be a place I returned.Quality: Ordered two different slices at Pizza Italia. Started with a standard Cheese Pizza Slice. It was not very good. Lacking in terms of flavor, and having a tough crust, it was not what I look for in my pizza. The Buffalo Chicken Pizza Slice was much better, making me believe the biggest issue is the red pizza sauce. It still had the crust issues, but the flavor and the mix of buffalo sauce and cheese was decent.Quantity: Large slices and big chunks of chicken on the Buffalo Chicken Pizza Slice.Value: $3.25 for a Cheese Pizza Slice. $4.50 for a Buffalo Chicken Pizza Slice.Ambiance: Pizza Italia is located in the Chelsea area of Manhattan. The shop is long and skinny, with a fair amount of seating. On both ends are seating areas with the kitchen at the center. There is also bar seating along the window parallel to the counter. Big windows keep the space bright, though the counter design does not really allow the pizzas to be showcased. Alternative rock music played in the background, but it was drowned out by the excessive number of students yelling and playing music on their phones.Crowd: During weekday lunch it was packed with high school and middle school kids. With a school across the way, expect chaos during weekday visits.Service: Fast and friendly staff.Parking: Extremely limited street parking in the area..I've never actually been to the store but we've gotten quite a few deliveries from them. The pies come hot and fresh every time. The flavor is popping - with a hefty balance of sauce, cheese, and toppings. The crust can be slightly thicker than your average thin New York slice which can be a hit or miss for me, but the pizza is still great for a local spot made with quality ingredients. I've had their cheese pie, margherita pie and pepperoni/sausage pie which have been wonderful. I would definitely recommend ordering from them if you're around the area."
"Sushi Wrap was awesome. Never saw it anywhere else.Tomato Basil soup really tastes homemade, light and tasty, I'll trust the chef on what he said that he makes all sauces from scratch.The tuna was a perfect medium, really good. Presented very elegant.Iced Caramel Mocha was awesome too.Will definitely go back again..Don't go there or order food from them ever. This place is just terrible, staff are mean, and  they're very disrespectful to you, the place is old and stinky, food is poor and from the freezer, not the freshest. dont get ripped off. Seriously..Quirky mixture. Chef Abie makes everything from scratch and had fresh gluten free muffins just out if the oven. Lots of interesting soups, black bean, root veggies, carrot ginger and who knows what else. He grows vegetables in his own backyard. But it looks a bit like a local pizza joint and also does sushi, which seems odd. The coffee was not particularly good. The peasoup was great..This guy is a real chef with his own unique food creations.The food is always prepared fresh and tastes homemade..Super affordable, healthy and delicious. My husband and I loved everything we ordered. We got a Caesar salad, two soups and two desserts for under $25. Antonio was a great, fun server and we will definitely be back soon..Loving the healthy cookies that they are carrying. Taste great, not heavy or dry, will definitely come back and try different menu items..Just not good. Ordered French onion soup  and got brown salty water with burnt onions inside. Just really no good. I wanted to like this place but... The service was bad ( no napkin, lucky the waiter gave  us a spoon to use) the soup was bad. You should take that soup off your menu it's horrific! So many amazing places in the area to eat at will surely stay away from here..Wow! For $5 we got 2 eggs, bagel & cream cheese, salad, coffee and home fries. The eggs were amazingly tasty (but not greasy), the home fries were cold but still surprisingly delicious, the salad was nice (although a lot of onion, but whatevs), and the coffee was good. The only miss was the 'bagel', which was more like a roll, and did not have a generous serving of cream cheese, but whatevs.I would also like to try some of the fish dishes.The crowd is mostly hasidic, but we are not and we enjoyed friendly service."
"Came here for a quick drink with a friend. We sat indoors as it was a pretty windy day. Friendly service with COVID-19 safety measures in place:- temperatures taken - contact details requested- all employees wearing masks - sanitizers available We ordered a round of drinks; fries for the kids. The shoestring fries were fresh, delicious and addictive I wanted to order another one but didn't want to ruin my appetite for impending dinner..The Hawaiian burger was really good, I don't typically like pineapple in my food but it worked perfectly in this burger. The fries were good, Morning our of the ordinary. The calamari was okay, it was over fried. Service could have been better, the waiter only checked on us once..Pros: menu options, service, drinks menu, locationCons: -We visited GMT Tavern during the pandemic restrictions, and thus had to sit outside. The interior of the locale is absolutely gorgeous and it was too bad that current circumstances didn't allow for us to sit inside. If you visit once indoor dinning is back, you'll really feel the British flair of this tavern!Our service was prompt and courteous. The menu had all the staples you would expect at a British pub, including sandwiches, fish and chips and shepherd's pie. The drinks menu included both liquor and cocktails as well as a number of imported beer options. We ordered a burger and a chicken sandwich and they were cooked perfectly. We topped it with cheesecake of course!We loved the place and will come back once we can dine indoors and enjoy the decor..The outside setting at ""GMT"" was very well organized and situated in a way that will bring comfort to any individual that dines here. Maybe it was the little candle on every table that seemed to glisten and cast a glow,making it a great back drop for a romantic movie. I ordered a Stella,which came in a nice tall sexy glass,it made me want to take sips and savor the flavor and drink my beer slowly. It wasn't a wine but it could have been. That glass makes it a great imposter. I ordered a medium rare Hawaiian Burger and fries. It came with a sliced pineapple on top. It was picture perfect. I honestly had to take pictures before sinking my teeth into the juicy burger. The side of fries was just an added touch of a reminder that ""GMT"" might be fancy but can give service like the classy Tavern it is. They also follow the Social Distancing guidelines set by the CDC. Giving 6 feet of social distancing space for everyone to enjoy themselves.The waitstaff was great,attentive and serviced my every need. They did not skip a beat. I will definitely be coming back with friends to wine and dine here. If you happened to be in the Village you must stop here before you go anywhere else. You will leave with a smile on your face!.Crazy how Le Souk closed permanently, and surprisingly the same building catches fire only a few years after their last fire only a few days after they announced the close... Suspicious? Maybe a tad bit!.I came here yesterday with a good friend of mine, and I was not blown away by the food. The service was okay, not particularly great, not bad either. We had a server who kept refilling our water without us having to ask which was nice, but the food left a lot to be desired. I will say, the buffalo wings were delicious, but that could have been because we were so hungry. The food came quickly which is one of the reasons why I give this restaurant two stars instead of one. The second reason? Yep, the buffalo wings. My friend and I both ordered salad with cooked shrimp. The shrimp was okay, but the salad was basically......ICEBERG LETTUCE! Now, we all know iceberg lettuce has like no nutritional value and is basically the lowest of the low in terms of what you serve your customers. It was an insult to be offered iceberg lettuce when asking for a salad. In such an establishment, we expected better, or at least I did. I could have made a better salad by going to my local grocery store, buying some romaine lettuce, adding some cooked shrimp, parmesan cheese and croutons. And I can assure you it would have cost me half as much. I'm sure the other food on the menu is a lot better than their so called ""nutritional"" options, but if I were to suggest a place to any of you, this would not be on that list. The drinks are much too expensive, and again, the salad was so mediocre, I almost wanted to run to the local grocery store, buy some spring mix and add some dignity to the plate. So to all my burger lovers, this is probably the place for you, but even so, I'm sure there are much better places with delicious burgers and REAL salads..Food was remarkably good.  Pork sliders very tasty,  pork tacos good and calamari was tasty.  Service was attentive.  Good neighborhood pub.  Our margarita drinks were excellent.  Good location.  Was clean..Sunday roast!!! As a super fan of Sunday roast I was actually quite surprised that GMT tavern serves the Sunday roast every Sunday!  I mean I walk passed by thousand times and don't know they are a very British bar lol. Actually quite impressive about their Sunday roast.  Very yummy roast beef. My medium one is just right. Soft inside. The Yorkshire pudding is with good quality and pairs well with gravy. Their gravy is cooked with the meat sauce. I would say too much carrot inside. But great for value. Compare to tea & sympathy bigger space and good quality of Sunday roast. What can you ask for :).The service at this bar is terrible. Waited an hour for bread and butter which didn't come until after our meals were served. Waiters ignored us several times after me and my group called. They brought out several of our meals wrong. Waiters are rude. The steak was good though. manager was very attentive and helpful though.It's a Friday night and you don't have a reservation and all the restaurants in Soho and Noho are tiny with few tables, what's a person to do? You go to GMT Tavern. (They also have outdoor seating for those nice fall/summer days.) Their beer and food menu is good enough. I've had their beer, Gin Blossom, flatbread, calamari, wings, and fish n chips. Generally speaking though, the food is average at best, especially for the price which is a bit high. But it comes out quick. It's perfect for after work dinner since it's also never too loud (given that it's never really crowded)."
"My Cubana was made from scratch. My cubano weighs over a poundMy coupon nestles on lightly grilled halves of a roll, with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and avocado on the bottom, a thinly sliced, lightly battered pork chop in the middle, juicy sausages, bits of bacon and pickled jalapeños, an omelette with chopped up beef, thin slices of ham, and freshly shredded mozzarella cheese melted on top.I'm pretty sure there were other flavors in the sandwich that I missed, because each layer was a revelation.This thing is HUGE - share with a friend or treat yourself to two solid meals. Highly recommend!.If you're looking for some utterly ridiculous deliciousness, then come here and get the Tortas Neza.  It's $15 and it's enough for 2 full meals.  Share it with someone, or even better get them to cut it into 4 pieces so you have room for something else in the neighborhood afterwards.""Its layers include fried, hot-dog-like sausages; a breaded and deep fried chicken cutlet; a chorizo omelet; several slices of head cheese and ham; refried beans; pickled jalapeños, lettuce, tomato, and avocado; and a generous helping of fresh, stringy, Oaxacan-style cheese.""  Also, eggs..The hunt for the Tortas Pumas has ended, I have looked for the truck for a couple of years now and I have finally found the shop that the Tortas Pumas is sold. The sandwich is the size of a bowling ball and it is insanely good and surprisingly not greasy. The sandwich was shockingly heavy and I was struggling just to finish half the sandwich, it was ""Juan hell of a sandwich."" Oddly enough, even though the sandwich looks like a mini person, it surprisingly is constructed really well, it wasn't a messy sandwich at all, I thought I was going to have to hose myself down after. The place itself is just a window and there is a bar next door but not sure if you could eat inside. I would suggest taking the food home and stuffing your face silly in the privacy of your own home. The place is a couple of stores down from the Junction Blvd station on the 7 train. Also, all the sandwiches are named after famous soccer teams, which was kinda neat.The food:Tortas Pumas- Milaneza de pollo, jamon, queso de puerco, chorizo, huevo, quesillo and salchicha. Fried chicken cutlet, grilled ham, head cheese, chorizo omelette, Queso Oaxaca and grilled hot dogs. Yes, it is last meal on earth type meal or a food challenge for the ages, it's also a meal that requires a nap afterwards. *strongly recommended* The torta, Mexican sandwich, itself is amazing. Yes, it has just about everything you can possibly put in a torta, but that is besides the point. And surprisingly all the ingredients kinda meld together to make one cohesive torta, it is a harmonic torta with a million ingredients lol The torta is pricey at $15 but it's basically $7.50 for half which is really like a whole sandwich in and of itself. The pickled jalapenos were perfectly pickled, they were nice and sour but not too spicy, the avocado slices offer a nice creamy texture as does the coleslaw. The chorizo omelette was made well and the flavor of the chroizo is imparted throughout the omelette. The grilled hot dog is nice but not really exciting, the chicken cutlet is perfectly tender and nicely crunchy but slightly lacking in flavor on it's own. The griddled ham was basic ham, and I didn't notice the presence of head cheese, though. Overall, a really amazing sandwich that you should share with a friend or a small village. yelp.com/user_local_phot….The amount of meat and cheese used in the tortas is ridiculous. He did not leave a single topping on the grill, everything was just packed into the sandwich. I swear I could have gotten a bicep workout from curling the bag. It was really savory and enjoyable until I finished eating the whole sandwich....I was stuffed. Great late night spot but sketchy neighborhood.P.S. this is the same person that cooks for the Tortas Neza cart near Junction..This is a great hole in a wall restaurant that feels so different you just have to try it. The lady cooking was very nice and generous and prepared us amazing ""la selection"" that satisfied my hunger almost after 3 bites. The sandwich was more than enough for me and my girlfriend. I recommend this place for anyone in the area..WOW! is the only way to sum up the sandwich I had.  Took a day and a half to finish it..Little hole in the wall but a hidden gem to all. Tortas made to perfection with flavors busting from its natural taste. Meats are all cooked well and the cheese is to die for. If your down to have a food High Venture come on over to Juan bar..Had to track this place down from ""Tortas Neza"" in Corona. Literally took my boyfriend and I about half an hour to find it but we finally did. It was worth the freezing 25 degree wait outside the bar. The tortas here are huge and he does not skimp at all. The first bite of the Torta Neza with chorizo and steak was heaven. After finishing it I could not move for a good ten minutes.Would come again when I want a worthwhile heart attack."
"I came here with a small group and was so so surprised by this hidden gem. the atmosphere is so romantic- I almost wish I had come with a date instead.The food was great and the drinks were even better! We ordered a few small plates to share including the fried rice, curry plate and edamame. I have to admit it took quite a while for our food to get to our table, but when it did it was delicious.I'd recommend coming as early as you can as the line gets very long after 6 p.m. Also- don't forget to tip the band! The music was lovely. Definitely somewhere I'll come back to..Biggest downfall is the really long wait (we might have waited for about 1.5 to 2 hours outside). Parties were entering the venue about every 10-15 minutes or so, which made it a painfully long. The food itself is delicious. Favorites of the night were the appetizers: octopus, jellyfish, and fried brief (which has a crispy exterior and oozing interior). The live jazz at night was great ambiance and the staff were really responsive (they asked us if we wanted to change our seats from the back booths to the bar seat when it became available, which I really appreciate, because it changed the experience entirely). 1 less star because while the food was good, I'm not sure if I would have waited that long for it again. Other friends have said they have either not waited too long or they came 30 minutes early ahead of opening time to avoid the long line..I always start with the positive the Music, Food & Drinks are awesome.Vibe is great! Service is great.The wait was way too long, a little over 2 hours. I'm a jazz lover, I've been to a lot of jazz club in NYC & other countries I have never had more than a half hour wait. Need to get organized between sets.Here's a suggestion,do a better job in cleaning the bathroom, it was filthy ( I know harsh words sorry ) but I heard someone else make a comment about the same issue not good.Scrub it down, make it look nicer & put nice scented air fresheners.You don't want any unwanted visitors if you know what I mean..Had such a great time at tomi jazz - fun music, ambience, and good food.We stopped in right around opening so didn't have to wait too long to get seated (maybe 20-30 min). The interior is cozy, dimly lit, and pretty loud once the music gets going. Your table location will definitely impact the amount of conversation you are able to have. The seats surrounding the band are very fun but very loud.The happy hour specials are pretty good, and the portions are not skimpy at all LOL. We made the mistake of ordering way too many ""entrees,"" thinking that they would be small plates... For two people, 2 appetizers, 1 entree, and a dessert would definitely be enough food. One waiter thought it was hilarious he kept bringing out more and more plates full of food.Everything tasted great though. The omurice and avocado pasta were my favorite entrees, and the croquette and spam rice balls are great appetizers. If you love bonito flakes, you will not be disappointed by the massive pile that they throw on top of the yaki udon and okonomiyaki. The honey toast is also a beautiful and tasty dessert that beats out grace street, in my opinion.Would highly recommend this spot if you are able to come right around opening - otherwise be prepared to wait a significant amount of time..Cool live music spot.Definitely go early because there's limited seating. We tried to go on a Saturday and got their right as the performance started at 6 and the line was so long. We ended up leaving bc it wasn't moving. Then we tried again on a Sunday for their happy hour deal and showed up before they opened at 5 and were third in line. But even tough we were third, it still took them almost 30 min to seat us. Once we got inside there were lots of open seats, but again it took them another 30 minutes to start filling them up. Idk we thought that was interesting. The plum wine is so good! Definitely recommend that. We also tried the frozen lychee martini and the Misty. The lychee martini which was good, but the misty was way too strong. For food, we got the wings, croquets, cod roe udon, okonomiyaki and omurice. It was so much food. We were stuffed, but it was good! Can't beat their happy hour deal!.Came here on a Friday night and was really questioning if waiting in line for 2 hours was worth it but once you get in you know it was all worth it. The cocktails were soo good. I really like the Mandarin Slush. It has a slight creaminess from the calpico. Highly recommend. The stir-fried cod roe udon was amazing. The vibes were immaculate with live jazz. Really enjoyed my time here!.Delicious food and amazing live jazz. This place is a really hidden gem. They don't take reservations and the place is really small so prepare yourself to make a line and wait outside for a while,  we arrived a Thursday night around 7pm and waited about 30 minutes to be seated, but it was totally worth it.We were given a table right in front of the band it was loud but no that we couldn't talk, if any it gave us an amazing vibe and at the end we felt really lucky to have that table. They offer the biggest variety of sake I've ever seen in a menu, also alcohol in general, just ask for basically whatever you like and they will probably have it.Even though it was a bit chaotic it was super cozy, felt incredibly warm, atmosphere 100 points, the host and server were incredibly friendly, the exemption to the rule of most speakeasies. Music, was spectacular! Not your average jazz band, we were able to see two bands perform and one was better than the other one, just increíble. About the food it was spectacular and incredibly well priced, drinks too, well served and strong, we had the lychee martini ($14), the lemon drop ($13) Orion Beer ($8) the fried oysters ($10) edamame ($4) , takana pickles fried rice ($14) and hayashi rice ($14) , everything was spectacular!!! Well served and delicious.Cannot finish talking good things about this place. Would definitely recommend and will continue coming..We came on a weekday but the line was so long we ended up having dinner somewhere else. Around 11pm, we stopped by and there was no line. It's such an intimate, small club that you can easily enjoy the music and atmosphere from anywhere! We didn't realize that the jazz only runs to 11:30pm or so and ended up not being able to see the band until the last 15 minutes. We were first seated in a back area room so we could only hear the music. But, there's no cover charge.We grabbed a few drinks and snacks to try and it was fun, relaxing, and tasty.  The tofu salad tasted fresh, the curry croquette were crispy and tasty while the seasoned octopus with wasabi made a great appetizer. Light snacks with drinks to enjoy the atmosphere. Come early and wait in line. But, expect a very long wait - it's a super small club..Ume Hime (plum based wine). Brown sugar plum wine, calpico, GFJ and lime juice. I asked for less alcohol and it was sooo good!The crab cream croquette was crispy on the outside and very hot and creamy on the inside. There is a mild crab flavor.My sister said they were known for their cod roe spaghetti. It was good! Tasted of the sea and creamy.The jazz music was my first jazz experience. It was very enlightening. There were four performers: piano, saxophone, bass and drums. Truc explained to me that they each took turns being in the spotlight. It was a very intimate and nice ambience that the jazz music gave.We were able to stay there for a maximum of 2 hours. After that we left to see a long line of people waiting outside. Good thing we rushed before opening to grab the first set of tables!Pros:-very good service-great Japanese food-good music-heat lamps for those who wait in line outside -provide plastic dividers for different parties sitting next to each other sharing a table-there is also bar seating Cons:-long wait-2hr table time -if you arrive early and grab the first round of tables, the performers start setting up and tuning up their instruments. They start playing at 6pm ish Tip:-Arrive before 5pm to start waiting in line. They will slowly start to seat each party one by one even though it opens at 530 technically..PSA THEIR HOURS ON YELP ARE WRONG, check their website for updated hours!!! Anyway, I heard the vibes were immaculate here and I can confirm they truly are (AND food is amazing). I've recommended this place to at least 7 people already and those who went were not disappointed either. If a friend were visiting NYC, I'd def take them here. If you're coming on a Friday or weekend, definitely line up before they open (aka arrive around 4:45pm or even slightly earlier) in order to get in without waiting hours. On weekdays, in my experience you can get away with arriving up to 30 min after they've opened but it may also depend on the day/week.  Happy hour is from 5-6pm on weekdays (none on weekends) and live jazz always begins at 6pm every day. The ambience and vibes of the restaurant are super intimate and cozy, it's underground and dimly lit with candles. The servers are really nice and always do a last call for happy hour at like 5:58pm which is much appreciated. And of course, the live jazz is always soooo good - shoutout to the amazingly talented band!!Okay but the best part is that the food is actually really dank... my favorites so far are the cod roe udon (AMAZING), avocado salad, fried brie, and omurice. However, everything else I've ordered in the past were still delicious (cod roe spaghetti, okonomiyaki, tenshindon, octopus with wasabi)! I'm not much of an alc person but my friends thought their drinks were pretty good (various plum wine drinks and the matcha drink). Can't wait to come back after omicron gets better T__T"
"Very good upscale steakhouse conveniently located right in Yankee Stadium. Great place for dinner before or after the game. Specialty is steak and I recommend the bone in rib eye. Sides are all good but the lobster Mac and cheese is really good. Also, the bacon appetizer is delicious. Service was friendly and professional. Only fault was our entries took along time to arrive. Seems they were backed up in the kitchen..One of the most romantic nights of our lives! My boyfriend is a huge Yankees fan so I surprised him with Delta Suite game tickets and a fabulous steak dinner before the game! The restaurant is INSIDE the stadium.. so very convenient and there are tvs everywhere to catch the game up close. Highly recommend! Excellent service and food quality!.Came here right before watching a yankee game. Of course I ordered the signature steak this place even during covid, is set up nicely. I felt this was a top of the line steak house. The colors were yankee signature colors. There were signatures on the wall as part of the decor. I would rate this a medium sized restaurant and the staff were very attentive and nice. Ok so onto the steak... the signature steak you was able to add engraving , so of course I asked for my initials. I ordered the steak medium, the steak was a little charred in some cases, probably should order it medium rare for this cut of meat. I also ordered the lobster macaroni. Wasn't really wowed by that. I feel it lacked pepper and salt. But it was ok. If i ever attend a baseball game, I'm definitely eating here again..I have to admit that this steakhouse exceeded my expectations. I honestly thought that this place was just about the name. I thought to myself ""okay yea great there's a steakhouse in Yankee Stadium"" but lo and behold it was fantastic. I went with a large group so I was able to try quite a bit of things. For appetizers we had the onion rings, lobster mac & cheese, NYY bacon and garlic mashed potatoes. All of the sides were great. My only critique is that the lobster mac & cheese definitely could have had some more lobster but none the less the flavor was there and it was delicious. For my entree I had the Delmonico Ribeye with the au poivre sauce on the side. The steak was cooked perfectly and the au poivre sauce was the perfect touch. Not sure if they offer specialty cocktails but I had a basic drink from the bar which was fine. Just as a note you do need a ticket to the Yankee game for that day to get in. If all you want to do is eat here you can easily get a nose bleed ticket for $15 and walk around the stadium after you eat for some entertainment, the energy is always great at Yankee Stadium. I would definitely recommend and I will definitely be returning..Wonderful experience, at the now retired downtown Manhattan site.  Please if she is working up in the Bronx location ask for Ashley Startek, she was the greatest waitress I have ever I had the pleasure of dining with!!4 Stars on Food and Atmosphere, 5+ Stars for our waitress Ashely..Yummy in my tummyServer Manny was fantastic.Would love to go back again.The delicious  volcano desert with liquor was bomb yummmm.Ok, the french onion soup was decent. The soup itself was bold and flavorful and the melty, partially crispy cheese covering the top was wonderful. The toast was a bit burnt, but other than that it was perfect. Unfortunately, that's all I had here. Apparently you need reservations in advance for one of the tables, but we sat at the bar and received pretty terrible service. It was awkward trying to have dinner at the bar. Even the ascent via the elevator to the restaurant and waiting at the hostess stand was awkward. But the other restaurant was full. It seems like dining at the stadium is the thing to do and even as the first pitch was made, there were still people eating.If you're planning on eating before the game, eat elsewhere, maybe before your commute because the neighborhood area is pretty sketchy. That, or make a reservation way ahead of time..Best. Steak. Ever!!!! What a way to watch the Yankees win and chow down. Awesome seeing the special knives the players use whenever they come.  The plates have Yankees numbers on them. The theming is on point. View is great. And best of all, the service. Go Yankees!.The food here was delicious came after the game. The big flint stone steak is big enoughTo share but it was my anniversary gift to my hubby so we each got one so we could have leftovers for the weekend. The chocolate cake was delicious..Great experience. Very friendly staff and well attended. Were seated on time for our reservation.The food was absolutely delicious. I ordered the pork chops, and it came with a mushroom oyster sauce, that had a feint but very delicious flavor to it. My friend ordered the Ribeye, which was absolutely delicious. Pretty cool thing, if you order the ribeye, they engrave whatever word you want into the bone, looks so cool. My friends also enjoyed some lobster mac and cheese. Nelson was an amazing server, very timely, efficient and had a good attitude, which goes a long way, he made it all worthwhile. Will definitely be going back soon."
"I'm not sure I would make the trek out here again specifically for this restaurant, but it certainly has all the makings of a top-notch neighborhood establishment.We shared all the vegetarian appetizers, including guac, plantains, and a plate of pupusas served in a bath of salsa and curtido. I'd normally be skeptical of pan-Latin dishes appearing on a nominally Mexican menu, but it's damn hard to find good pupusas in NY, and these did the trick.For mains, we ordered that stalwart vegetarian option on every Mexican menu the world over, the chile relleno. This was a 5-star rendition, perfectly cheesy inside and crispy on the outside..I've walked by this place forever- but after Jolie Cantina is no longer, where does one get a decent Margarita?  NOT HERE! We were promptly met at the entrance and whisked away past the indoor crowd, to a music-free back yard space with a string of lightbulbs, most of which were out and a few heatlamps (we weren't lucky enough to benefit off of). Completely charmless. Service was naturally spotty because all the action was inside- so that actually was understood.  We ordered a round of cocktails including a Marg, a vodka tonic and some 12 yr old whisky on the rocks. What *eventually* was presented to us was 3 fingers of margarita and crushed ice in a juice glass $14. That is barely 4 oz (including crushed ice- I have the same glasses at home) This was a draft cocktail, my v/t in the same glass and my husband's whisky in a thimble size (2 oz) cordial glass (neat). While we were there for proper dinner we started out with some snacks simply because the wait person was insistent that we place the order- girl was busy: we ordered some guacamole- which came out presented in half an avocado for $12.  Note, Jolie Cantina's is made table side with three whole avocados for $16. We also ordered croquetas for $10- which were three pinky sized fried thingies. Natch, we ordered more drinks: a pitcher of Margs for my sister- so that she could decide the pour herself ($50).  The pitcher was the size of an infant's head.  We kind of knew it wouldn't be a Big Gulp size, so whatever, we also knew most places would have closed down their kitchen at this point, so we also ordered a bottle of red wine (not a fan of tequila) and some tacos. The wine was $75. My guess is ordered a lot more than that- because at the end of the day, this set me back $460 for three (3) people and very little food. To note, people seemed to be blissed out by this place and that's fine; I get it, sort of: gentrified Brooklyn + millennials on a Friday night = very low expectations. Never again..Wow. This was a real cool cocktail experience. I ordered their ""draft"" tequila and homemade grapefruit soda/splash of lime drink. Had 2 and it was outrageous. I don't even like tequila. It was a blanco and it was so light and refreshing. We ordered many food items. We ordered the Pupusas - with veggies and cabbage and cheese , very flavorful Panuchas- shrimp with coconut-Habenero flavoring. Not to sweet or hot. Very very good Skirt steak- thin and flavorful and yummy. Only a couple fatty pieces but I'm not a steak personThe FLAN as a dessertEverything was extremely flavorful and yummy We sat at the bar which was cool And we spent a solid amount of money. I was think that they should throw in a shot when you keep ordering and they didn't do that but it was a solid awesome experience and we will be back for sure..If a good cocktail has the power to transport you to parts unknown, then a visit to Leyenda is as good as buying a ticket to South America. I imaging that sipping on a frozen cocktail and grazing on croquetas, arepas, and pupusas is a kind of heaven most of you reading this would enjoy, so take my word for it and make your way to Leyenda. Couple that with their covered backyard and you can treat this spot like the little oasis that it is.They are well known for their cocktails, and for good reason. I love a menu that outlines exactly what kind of glass your drink will come in, which I think matters more than some people know. As I pore over the bebidas menu again while writing this review I feel so remiss to not have ordered the 'Chispa de Cobre,' a drink that serves 2 and looks like it comes in a mortar and pestle (pardon my ignorance if this is not at all what this vessel is called)-- but the ingredients list, smoked paprika, guajillo, cinnamon, spiced orange milk punch, honey, and chocolate bitters sounds like the kind of drink that would send me to oblivion. Instead I enjoyed a delicious frozen cocktail with tamarind, and their Michelada, which was solid. We snacked on some pupusas to satisfy a carb + cheese craving and were floored by how delicious this dish turned out. I have no doubt their entire menu would be divine, so I'm planning another visit asap..Super cool, small, cozy bar with sooooo many tequila options! The bartenders are super informative and happy to recommend you a great tequila to your liking. It gets pretty busy during the weekend but there's always a seat somewhere!.COVID report: as of December 2021, Leyenda had both indoor and outdoor dining (front and back patio). They have heat lamps. My boyfriend and I came for dinner in late December and sat outside in the back. They were serving the Sleyenda cocktail menu, and pretty much every drink sounded amazing, so it was hard to chose. I tried:+ Nightmare before Christmas cocktail+ Coquito ho ho cocktail+ Candy striper cocktail + Churrasco skirt steak+ Al pastor tacos+ Fried sweet plantains with crema+ Churros The food highlights were the skirt steak and plantains, and my favorite drink was the candy striper. It tasted like a boozy candy cane in the best possible way. Definitely will be back!.Loved the holiday decor and festive cocktails! I'd definitely come back for the drinks, light bites and vibes.We ordered the skirt steak, al pastor tacos and a couple of the starters which were all great. Portions were on the smaller side so I wouldn't count on getting super full. All in all, food was solid and the drinks were very impressive. I really appreciated the range of cocktails and holiday drinks..I have been a New Yorker my whole life but damn I gotta tell you...I had a great experience here. I came here on a Friday night right at dinner rush and had a great experience. I would honestly say Casa Enrique you got a little competition here in BK.I got here with my best friend around 7:50PM tonight. I was a bit skeptical because whenever one of my friends say ""I got the best Latin American restaurant"" I have a better time at Taco Bell...However, I was very wrong tonight. Everything from the beginning to end was absolutely great.We got in where it was very busy. Our server was so nice and said if you want you can take the window seat for 2 and once something opens up for 2 I will seat you. We sat for a total of 5 min and then a table for 2 opened up. Great seats (go to the back if you want great seats, but not outside). We ordered our first round of drinks after settling in. Being a martini snob and it being Latin American cuisine, I got a dirty tequila martini to see if the bartenders live up to their name. Holy **** I was very impressed. Great dirty martini overall and they did it well with Tequila!!!! I would say if you're a martini person highly recommend. Granted it wasn't on the menu still a 5/5.So the appetizers are always a good indication if the restaurant was good or not. Being I was here with my best friend, I got a vegetarian (EMPANADAS DE HABA). I was expecting average at best, but wow...(5/5) Delicious and def a must have whether a vegetarian or not. My friend had a meat dish (CHORIZO, POTATO, CHEESE FLAUTAS) and she thought it was phenomenal as well. The only disappointment was the basics (GUACAMOLE, HOUSE-MADE CHIPS & SALSA). I would give it average at beat (3/5)Whenever I get great appetizers, I am always worried about the mains. Being in the company of a carnivore, we got different dishes. My friend got a main meat dish (CHURASSCO SKIRT STEAK) while I reverted to my vegetarian ways (VEGAN TACOS). To be honest, I always hated vegan tacos at any Latin American restaurant, but damn...Very impressed from the tortilla to the flavor profile. It was easy the best vegan tacos I have ever had (5/5)As we approach the end of our meal, we decided to try the dessert to see if it will disappoint. By this point I was 2 dirty tequila martinis in and decided to for once try something different from a ""dirty (insert clear alcohol) martini."" I had the MEXICAN HOT CHOCOLATE and it was delicious (5/5). On top we got the CHURROS. Now my favorite churros are the ones from Roosevelt Ave on the E, F, R and M train platform, but these are just as good. I recommend dipping these in the MEXICAN HOT CHOCOLATE for a flavor explosion.Overall one of the beat Latin American restaurants I have been to in NYC. If you're in BK you should check this place out. Easily one of the best Latin American restaurants I have had the pleasure of trying. Outside of the GUACAMOLE, HOUSE-MADE CHIPS & SALSA, everything was a easy 5/5..So where do I start.... This place was different. You MUST make reservations before heading to this place. You can make it via the yelp app.***Vaccination Card Required for dinning ***The inside is pretty small. They have an outdoor area but it was December 2021, too cold to be out there. The menu was not large at all. I expected more of a variety option but it was decent.The spike hot cocoa was so good. I ordered 2 of those.Food was decent - nothing I'd go crazy over.Music - variety but don't expect to hear hip-hop, rnb or even latin music. I believe it was house music. Would I return? Ehh probably not. I wasn't really impressed but perhaps i had different expectations that weren't met. If you're in the area, check it out and let me know how it goes..This place is a nice quiet place, if you want to have a quick drink or something to eat. The bartenders are awesome when I want a place to myself or with company this place is my first choice"
"You can eat inside now! This ramen was crazy. I don't think I've ever had anything quite like it. I got the spicy miso tsukemen and I think it was the right choice. The noodles were the thickest ramen noodles I've ever seen, they were as thick as some udon I've had but still chewy and yellow and curly. The marinade on the egg was so delicious that I didn't even care the egg is hard boiled. Chashu is fantastic, melt in your mouth tender. The broth is very interesting. Extremely thick, not overly spicy but very flavorful. It leaned much sweeter than other miso ramens I've had. The sweetness is accompanied by a rich nutty flavor, almost like peanut butter or tahini. The kimchi provided a great fresh crunch in between bites of richness. I got the radish salad too. It's huge and fucking awesome. I'm not sure what was in the dressing exactly but I suspect a lot of sesame products. It was very cool and refreshing and I highly recommend it..Came here to try the well-known dipping ramen. There is no indoor seating, only outdoor which seats maybe 12 people. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated but the host took our order when we were ready before sitting down. I had the Sio Tsukemen which is garlic based; the broth was watery and not thick enough to stick on the noodle. This was quite disappointing as I love dipping ramen. My husband opted for the Spicy Miso ramen which did have a thick broth. Overall I wasn't that impressed. Could have been much better. I will stick with Tabetomo just a few blocks away for their dipping ramen..I have been wanting to try this place for a long time after seeing the mix of reviews, I want to give it a try myself. I had the spicy miso tsukemen (dipping ramen) is pretty good. It's not very spicy, with a lot of toppings on the side. The chicken and pork broth is think so it stick to the thick wheat noodle very well. The broth is not very vinegary like others so you could still drink it if you don't mind high sodium. I wish the egg is runny tho. And the pork is thick but cold.My husband had the sio tsukemen which is garlic based; the broth is watery and not thick enough to stick on the noodle. And I saw the other table are having the regular soup ramen the broth look very water down. There's no indoor seating, I came on the cold day at 2pm still have to wait around 15mins in the cold to be seated. The outdoor seating provides small table fan size heater so it's still cold. Outdoor sits probably max 12 people. Also keep in mind that this is cash only business. Make sure bring cash, or there's an ATM closeby..Decent ramen spot to fulfill that ramen craving. Currently, they only have outdoor dining (only 3 tables) and it's cash only!I got the Toro Niku Ramen (thick noodles) while my brother got the Minca Sio Ramen (thin noodles). The broth in the Minca Shio Ramen has a more deep richer and saltier flavor in comparison to the Toro Niku which has a lighter-tasting broth. But either way, the ramen just gets too salty by the end of the meal. The Toro Niku has two thick pieces of tender pork meat but 60% of it is fat. The cabbage helps balance the deeply marinated soy sauced flavored meat. The yolk of the egg is fully cooked.There's no wow factor. If you just want ramen that can fill you up, drop by..Small little ramen joint, if your not looking you'll walk right past it. They're still only open for outdoor dining with 5 tables. So going to be a wait if they're busy. Ordered their spicy tankatsu ramen. Would be a 4 star but the noodles were a bit to undercooked. Will recommend for a quick ramen fix..Currently they do not have any indoor seating. They have an outdoor seating structure with about 3 4 top tables.  Service was friendly and quick. Cash only establishment. There was a nice variety of ramen options. I got the basic ramen with thick rich tonkotsu broth. I love that they had 5 options of noodles, thin and thick wheat noodles, wavy noodles, rice noodles and gluten free noodles   The ramen was topped with 2 thick pieces of pork chasu, 1/2 hard boiled egg, Scallions, mushrooms and bamboo shoots and a piece of nori. It came out hot but the broth could have used a bit more flavor. Overall a solid spot for ramen if you are in the area, but not worth going out of your way for..This place is so yummy! It's definitely a hole in the wall spot for such a popular ramen restaurant. Keep an eye out for it. We realized it was nearby one of our errands and had it on our list so went to check it out. TWO TIPS FOR WINTER GOERS: 1. It's outdoor seating only, there's a small heater in each section so since it was off peak time we used an extra heater, but ITS COLD, wear a jacket,2. It's cash only..idk why opinions on this are spotty, it's cash only. Order the spicy ramen it's delicious and make sure to ask for extra tea. I think the noodles the spicy ramen come with are too thick and chewy so change out your noodles (there's options)..I used to frequent Minca's during college years and wanted to see if their ramen was still as good. I ordered the spicy ramen but it just wasn't the same :( maybe I'll revisit to try their garlic based broth ramen, which was my fav..3.5-4 stars: we started off with the famous radish salad and it was quite good. Then we tried the super spicy kimchi ramen and the spicy miso ramen. I will say that we knew in advance the ramen was a bit different than many other places we've been but we were eager to try something new. I enjoyed the spicy miso ramen though it's definitely more peanut butter-y of a flavor here, and the eggs are not soft boiled, as an FYI in case that's your thing. The chashu however was absolutely perfect and melted in your mouth. The super spicy ramen didn't have a strong flavor really, more so just spicy, which isn't my thing but my partner enjoyed it!Overall, enjoyed the meal and sitting outside with some hot tea and soup..First time back since Covid, and I am sorely disappointed. Got the spicy tonkotsu ramen tonight and it was lacking flavor, depth, umami, salt, and richness. The soy egg is hard boiled, not soft boil. The chasu was the best part - melt in your mouth good. Noodles were cooked well. If broth makes or break ramen for you, then I might skip this spot. On a positive note, the gyoza and shrimp shumai were both good."
"clean and friendly subway.  they give you more than normal portion, and you can always ask for more.  Good location close to court house with dine in seats..RIP OFF!!  STAY AWAY!  At the suggestion of some co-workers, I ordered today, used the APP to order ahead, and went & got my sandwich.  Came back to the office, and what I unwrapped looked like a tiny salad sandwich, with like one slice of meat on it, and the overall size could maybe feed a mouse.I ordered the Spicy Italian PRO, but I must have ordered from their Children under 10 menu.   For $3 more, you are supposed to get double protein - which I'm assuming is the meats.  I literally had to bring the sandwich up to my eye to discern that there were actually 2 slices of Peperoni & 2 slices of Salami on the sandwich.Whether it is a company policy, or the store policy, or maybe just that the sandwich maker did not fully read the mobile order, what I received is completely unacceptable and I feel cheated and ripped off.As you can see by the picture, it's like they made a salad sandwich threw on a slice or 2 of meat on it. It certainly doesn't look anything likeFor the same $15, I could go to a local deli on Metropolitan and get a ""Godfather"" hero that is like 4x the size of this.Now, do I expect Subway to make & sell something like that?  No.  I know that's not their business model.  But when I order ""Double""-something, I at the very least expect it to be something slightly larger than their basic sandwich.At the end of the day, I walked away feeling like my order was not completed as it was supposed to be, that I over-paid for my meal, that this location is a complete RIP OFF, and/or has SHADY business practices.  It's either that, OR their employees are not very bright, or do not have basic reading skills, or just don't care.  Whatever the case, that falls on those that own & run this franchise location.If I were you, I'd stay away from this store..This has to be one of the worst subway restaurant around. Today I dropped in this particular location, the restaurant was dead ,so I ordered 2 sandwiches one for me and one for my wife. I got the oven roasted chicken foot long on honey oat wheat bread for my self.me sandwich was Medicore .The bread didn't seem fresh at all.I ordered my wife a 6 inch tuna on honey oat wheat. The lady making the sandwich only put a very small portion of tuna on the sandwich, with a little vegetables. Usually they give you more vegetables and no meat. When my wife tried the sandwich she said this was one of the worst subway sandwiches ever. Thebread was hard there was really no tuna fish on the sandwich. The lady this morning making the sandwich seems like she was distracted or something else was going on with her.Subway usually use fresh baked bread, not bread from yesterday,come on subway you should do better than this bad sandwich making spot.I would have given them no stars if that was an option. Definitely a waste of money. I should have read the bad reviews on this subway restaurant before I choose to come inside, but I learned my lesson this spot is definitely a  no go next time iam in this area..This location is awfully small. The layout gives me a headache. The serving station where they prepare your meal is awkwardly located to the left behind a huge beam. This makes it difficult to see and causes issues when trying to navigate from the serving station, to the register to pay, and finally to the fountain machine. The tables and chairs are positioned on top of each other. The line becomes an issue if there's four or more people waiting to be serviced. The line blocks other patrons from moving about the restaurant to retrieve their drinks or seats. Also it's a fire hazard when trying to enter or exit the restaurant. They are very sloppy when it comes to making sandwiches. I had to repeat what I wanted twice. The cheese was lopsided and didn't look appealing.  I guess the guy wanted to knock out as many sandwiches as he could without considering the quality of his work. Listen guy you are no chef but c'mon pay attention to the way you slap ingredients on a sandwich. Onto the condiment lady. She was so stingy with the chipotle mayo but extremely generous with the spinach. Ehh relax there I didn't ask for a salad. Just a few will do. The woman in front of me also had to ask for extra condiments. Like damn is it coming out of your paycheck? Whatever..Just no. Do not do it. It's so dainty inside and not inviting at all. Everything here is bland including the attitude of the staff. Parking is a disaster and the cups they give you for water are so cheap you'll have to get up a minimum of 3-4 times to fill up the tiny clear cup. This place is such a waste. Download the app and join the rewards program they'll send some good coupons to get major discounts..This place NEVER has coffee. The staff: ""Coffee maker not working."" If you serve breakfast, you need to have coffee. Dunkin' Donuts is right next door -- and always has great coffee waiting to be served. The staff also needs to be more attentive. Many times I stand there waiting to order but the staff cannot be bothered to come out from the back..Went in because they take Apple Pay and this is the first subway I can actually read the labels of their sauces. It's probably the cleanest subway I've ever walked into. Saw a post below that they were skimping in sandwiches before writing this and can say that I got the usual amount of meat..SKIMMING on sandwiches!Do not go to this subway they skim on sandwiches by giving you less meat than you are entitled to.  On at least 4 separate occasions I have gone in and the employee making the sandwich put 7 slices of meat on a footlong only to put the 8th slice on when asked...leading me to believe that this is not mistaken but a management ordered practice.DO NOT give them your business as they are skimming less meat on your sandwich only to make a quick buck at your expense..This subway is not that good, one Saturday night one of the workers was basically hustling us out because she wanted to close, mind you this was earlier than the advertised time..I wish that you could give this Subway zero stars because that's what they really deserve truly. You walk in to use the restroom before you order and they stop you. You tell them you want to wash your hands before you eat and they tell you to order first then you can use the restroom. Your about to order and now they tell you the restroom is broken after gossiping to each other and laughing. This Subway staff is extremely disrespect truly made me feel uncomfortable please don't come here. I left and went some where else to eat I recommend you do the same. There so many more great places to eat around here why let them ruin your day when you could go somewhere else and have them make you smile."
"Port Authority bus terminal. Definitely not one of those places anyone enjoys waiting for their transport in. Friday afternoon, with time to spare before hopping on a bus to D.C., me and the gf thought it would be great to have one drink before hitting the road.Yelping landed us in District M. In my opinion, one of the best tucked away secrets for that area.District M can be found inside the hotel associated with their address. It's relatively easy to get to because of the elevators you can use. We really appreciated the elevators because we were carrying travel bags.When we arrived, I noticed a bunch of people (with travel bags) sitting on benches in between the bar and the restaurant. Also, I couldn't help but notice how clean and modern District M looks. There are also a variety of seating options: Nice comfy seating for groups of four or so, small tables for those who want bar service, and regular bar stool space at the bar.We opted for the small table, and afterwards approached the bartender to inquire about happy hour options. I went with the Sam Adams, and my gf went with a glass of red. The ambiance of the place is nice, quiet, and casual. Feels like an oasis when compared to the chaos nearby on 8th avenue near Port Authority.Highly recommend people check this place out..Now hotel lobby bars are not a first choice simply because they are usually ahh this place looked cool & the reviews were not bad so we figured why not check it out since we were in the area & needed to kill some time, For a hotel lobby bar this place looks nice, decent set up with room to sit. We sat & the Bar I had a some Stella since my night was just starting good beer can't go wrong my friend tried the M for maurizio taste wise ok but kinda sad looking in the sense that it was serve in a flute very small drink for the price. Decent looking bar, good music playing , service was ok at the bar .. drink prices r high beer seems to be the cheapest not a bad place to sit & drink assuming u are not making it your only stop..Chic cafe for a great quick breakfast or cup of coffee.I stopped in on a Saturday morning for a quick breakfast before work. I didn't realize it was there due to its location in the hotel's entrance in spite of being in that area quite often. There was no line and hardly anyone there and plenty of seating since it also seemed to double as a part of the lobby.The coffee was really good and the breakfast sandwich was clearly pre-made, but used high quality ingredients and reheated well.This would be a great place to meet for a coffee meeting/date or just to stop by and relax for a bit..The District M Bar inside of The  Row really nice and upscale and the bar also has a menu so check it out while in Time Square..We came here to claim our two free drinks of prosecco per night at the Row hotel (which was a scam!). As we sat down at the bar, the bartender (some young guy with tattoos) would glance at us but wouldn't come to greet us or anything. He kept hanging out near the corner of girls. We looked at the menu for about 5 minutes until he finally came over and asked us what we wanted. I told him about the free prosecco and he was confused at first but then asked us for our room number. He filled up our glass and then went back to the corner of girls. It's cool if he wants to hit on the girls, but hey, at least take care of our drinks first and our refills and then you can do whatever you want. Another bartender came by and asked us how we were doing and he cared more about us than the first guy. Their prices are quite expensive here. I recommend going somewhere else with better prices and better customer service.Went here one evening after a show for a drink because I read all the reviews that made it seem like a real hidden gem. Not the case. This is your standard, run-of-the-mill, hotel bar. If you're looking for a nice quiet place to sit between a family from Italy with 3 small children and a family from Wisconsin with their invalid granny, then this is your place!  The drinks are decent enough, but priced higher than they should be. But expected since it's in a hotel lobby in the middle of Time Square.  To use the restrooms, you need a hotel room key. We had to borrow one from the gift store salesperson..rude and unhelpful server . Works the Tuesday night shift , Latin chic.. I went to a whole new hotel bar to get away from her and that attitude.Surprisingly good gourmet hand-stretched pizza, and live entertainment certain nights.They've got a focused (read: small) menu, and the kitchen's good at what they do. Their Mulberry Street ($18; credit accepted) was a crowd-pleaser, full of spicy fennel sausage, mozzarella, and roasted bell peppers. The cheese was super stretchy, and the whole shebang came out in a jiffy.Service isn't the fastest if you need a follow up on your initial order, but in their defense, there's usually only one or two folks supporting a mob of patrons (locals and people staying at the hotel - this is a hotel bar)..Absolutely one of my favorite bars in the city! Such a hidden gem, literally, since it is located inside the Row NYC. A very intimate space compared to other places in Hell's Kitchen with lots of seating in a spacious layout, whether you prefer to sit at the bar or at a table.I've been here on dates and just to catch up with friends, and have also been here once for live music once which was fun. The noise level isn't too loud, which is great since you can actually have conversations with those you are with. I love the chic, sleek feel/decor of the bar which creates such a great atmosphere. I've always found the  bartenders/waiters have always been very nice and helpful as well.District M is home to one of my most favorite cocktails in Manhattan - 15 Shades of Green (vodka + rose). I will always come back for them! All in all, I highly recommend going to District M, especially since its location is so convenient and close to many NY attractions. It will not disappoint!.Row was pretty cool!  We came here last weekend (halloween weekend) The cocktails though were over priced but the ambience was great. Me and my girlfriend  came to stay  and watch a broadway show for the weekend and this was a cool little bar in the row hotel to hang out at before our show. The pizza was really good we ordered a mulberry pizza and two cocktails. They had a dj who was awesome and she played really good musi and was super friendly when we asked to take a photo with her.  They also had a projector up which was cool and we got to watch the game. I def. recommend this spot."
"Absolutely loved the coffee I got here. Service was wonderful, and it's very clear that the owner and employees really geek out about coffee. It's definitely not a place to get work done, but it doesn't pretend to be that. I think some coffee shops try to be a workspace while also setting a high standard for coffee, but kind of fall short on both ends. Box kite knows what it's about - an excellent cup of coffee, either taken to go, or enjoyed at the bar, maybe with a book or a friend..I admit, I don't drink coffee. However, my family, particularly my dad- and my boyfriend are all coffee snobs. Elliott's a barista himself. We liked Box Kite so much, we went back to order a second round on our first visit, and we ended up going 2 days in a row  . Boyfriend tricked me into oatmilk latte and i LOVED it. Tip: its teeny inside, like big coats and backpacks are problematic teeny. So prepare for that. Fret not, this is the upper west side, where there are tons of cute dogs to pet if you're waiting outside:) Also, you have to spend sometime looking at the wallpaper! It's super cute and funky! Lastly, to complete a fairly random review, I think they sell a few pastries, but seemed to be okay with the guy reading hemingway and munching on levain cookies from around the corner. That compliment Box Kite's coffee so well! They should do a collaboration hah.I admit, I don't drink coffee. However, my family, particularly my dad- and my boyfriend are all coffee snobs.

That compliment Box Kite's coffee so well! They should do a collaboration!!.Got an amazing iced coffee that I added cream and milk which is given you on the side and you mix it in yourself. Hands down best coffee in the west side!!.Best coffee in the area but worst service. Never friendly and today the person working there added a $3 tip without me authorizing, which I only realized because I got an email afterwards.  So shady, avoid!!.No coffee is good enough to make it worth how they treat you here.I've tried coming twice during their posted hours to buy coffee beans--once at 11am and once at 9am--only for the door to be locked with an employee inside. The first time, he ignored me until I went away. The second time, I waited 15 minutes to get inside, and the guy got annoyed and started arguing with me when I asked if their hours had changed from the ones on the door. I don't live nearby. All I wanted to know was if there was a better time to come, since it involves getting on a subway for me.Food service isn't fun, and I'm sure they're used to dealing with bad customers. But it's disappointing to be treated like one every time you try coming to this place. Look at the other one- and two-star reviews--I'm not the only one..Tiny little shop, on the expensive side (above $5 for most coffees), but good coffee for sure. Very limited choices of pastries but one very good chocolate croissant is enough for me! Kids liked the strawberry ginger muffin. Great service, nice atmosphere..Nice little coffee shop. There isn't too much seating, but that's part of the allure. I had a cappuccino and it was excellent--and I'm somewhat picky when it comes to coffee. Would definitely recommend, a nice treat!Prices are obscene, but no stars deducted since they run at the NYC standard (e.g. $5 for a latte). I guess you gotta do what you gotta do to bring in the loot..That place was undoubtedly remarkable. Best service, clean, and beautiful atmosphere. Everything is delicious. Service is also great as our server was very nice and constantly checked on us. What a great spot!.Service - 2 starsBatch brew 1 ($2.50) - 3 starsPretty dilute but smooth and not tannic.Pastry selection was dismal..Great for coffee aficionados.  Limited selection and limited space but the coffee is top notch"
"This is the second time ordering take out, and even for take out, the food is delicious. I ordered the Farfalle Riviera and my husband ordered the Veal sorrentina. The Farfalle Riviera had the right amount of creaminess with a food balance of salmon and pasta. My husband loved his veal Sorrentina as well. The portions are generous, food delicious, and the staff is friendly, so I'm giving this place five stars!.Picked up Christmas Eve dinner Veal Parmigiana and penne alla vodka perfect as always and the portions were great. Dan is the man. thanks.Friendly and affiant staff, for this low key gem in Whitestone.Their food is consistently excellent at a fair price.Parking is street, but never hard to find.It's what you hope to have in your local area great food but very casual no need to stress about what your going to wear..My neighbors recently bragged on how great the food was, my wife ""reminded "" me that we had eaten there long ago and we loved it... so off we went and was NOT disappointed in the least. Parking is street parking and on a Tuesday night was easy and close by. We got there in time to enjoy the early bird specials. Place was busy but was glad to see we were checked for our CDC card! Tables were perfect and we were comfortable from the time we went in. Staff was very attentive, courteous and responsive to our needs. Food was excellent! Nice portions (not enough to bring home) but enough to satisfy. Salmon for me and Veal Cutlet parmigiana was very good. Salad and Soup was good, Really have nothing but praise. Check them out! Support your local business..Portions are huge and the price is affordable! The staff are always friendly and attentive everytime I go. Food itself isn't amazing but it isn't horrible. I think it's worth it considering it's cheaper compared to other Italian spots.Went for an early price fixed dinner. Nice selections for $18.95. Nicely plated, generous portions. Only problem was the noise level.Will return..I can't say enough amazing things about this restaurant  My family and I have been going here for many many years. It's always been one of our favorite places to eat in the Bayside/Whitestone/Flushing area.First and foremost, the service is amazing. The waiters are extremely attentive, informative and friendly. Very accommodating for custom requests and answer any questions you have about the menu. Secondly. The FOOD!!! It's amazing. Everything I've ever gotten from here is so good. I usually get the cold antipasto salad, and the penne a la vodka when I visit every time. It's the best penne a la vodka I have ever had at any restaurant! Food is always PERFECT and very fresh and tasty. One of my favorite restaurants ever!Third - the restaurant is very nice and clean! Separate bar area set away from the dining area which I really like! It's a beautiful space and a great location to host a dinner event for friends and family. If you are in the area, definitely stop by! Located right on Utopia Parkway off the highway it's a super convenient location.Food and service is always great here. Went today about 1:30 for Christmas Eve lunch. Not too full. They asked to see our vaccination cards. However, the staff was not wearing masks, which kind of made me nervous..An excellent Italian restaurant in Whitestone! Delicious bread kicks off what is always a wonderful meal - the fresh pastas can't be beat! I had the Rigatoni ala'Ortolana and my friend had the Farfalle al Pesto and both were absolutely spectacular! A very reasonable wine list complements the meal perfectly, and the fresh fruit to end the meal in a great touch. Definitely a top-notch, fancy yet affordable Italian restaurant!.Tonight my family had a wonderful  dinner at the Riviera.  The food was hot and delicious and the portions were generous.  My husband had the lamb special that was excellent and I had the special Chicken Cordon Bleu. My brother and his wife both enjoyed a seafood and pasta dish. Great desserts and hot cappuccino to finish off.The seating is pleasant (not too congested like many NY restaurants. Food was tasty and plentiful. Consider sharing entrees. The entrees has a bit more cheese than I enjoy. Consider asking for them to go light on the cheese- you can alway add more later!  The deserts were spot on. Cappuccino and Expresso finished off the dinner. Reasonable pricing and great staff service."
"We stopped in for a quick lunch after hitting a few different stores before.  First, we started with drinks and that was probably the highlight of the meal.  I got a blue raspberry lemonade.  Anyone who knows me knows how much of a child I am when it comes to anything blue and specifically blue raspberry. It was absolutely delicious and I couldn't help myself from asking for a second towards the end of the meal. Next came the appetizers where Applebee's really shines. We got the sampler and everything was great. The mozzarella sticks were hot and the cheese was perfectly melted.  The boneless wings had a great flavor, the quesadillas (arguably my least favorite part) were good and the spinach dip hit the spot.  I could've kept eating appetizers all day.Finally, I ordered my main dish, which was a chicken fajita roll up and it just lacked much of any flavor.  It was okay, but that was it, just okay.  Next time I go to Applebee's I think I'll stick to ordering a bunch of different appetizers as my meal, because they were drastically better than my main meal..We walked in , not so many people were in the Resturant . They were short handed . I asked for a table for 4 .  The hostess said it would be a while.So we said we could sit at the bar . Then they proceeded to tell us , the Resturant is on a ""wait"" meaning the kitchen was busy . It was 6pm . And not a crowded Resturant . Just were happy to have us leave !!!!.Just got back.....where do I start?  Sat at the bar and ordered a beer and some food with my wife.  All NFL games available through Direct TV advertised on the card in front of me however no football on any of the TVs.  I ask the bartender and she asks me what channel should she put on?!?!  She asked a manager to help her and after wizzing up and down the guide he says he doesn't have any football.  After I insist he tries again and finds a game.  The prices have risen and the bartender was tending to patrons at the bar as well as all the tables in the bar area.  I realize that Covid plays a part in both price and staffing levels but I'm still not happy at this point.  Food and drink arrive after a waiter tried twice to give us things we didn't order.  I then overhear some mention a $5 drink special.  When I enquire the bartender digs a flyer with the drink special printed on it.  Too late!  I'm already sipping my drink!  A few minutes later I overhear another person mentioning a Happy hour.  I see the bartender dig out a flyer and hand it to the patron.  No where are the drink special or the happy hour apps posted where you can see them.  If you don't know to ask you are out of luck!  Although the bartender tried her best, these issues are a product of poor management.  If you check my history you'll see I am a pretty fair reviewer.  Rarely do I post less than 3 stars.  The beer was cold and our food was decent so I add a star (I wanted to go one star). There are certain things you should expect when in a chain......this place used to deliver.....it no longer does.Friendly service and very good specials.  The food is what you'd expect from a chain like this.  Covid separation is done well.  The bar is nice when there are no restrictions.  Get the riblets!.No flavor ribs where old mac and cheese pasta with cheese tossed on top asked for fries with cheese on top got got cold old fries no cheese hubs burger cold people where nice but were never going back I paid 50 bucks for dog food it was just that simple the food sucks.No flavor ribs where old mac and cheese pasta with cheese tossed on top asked for fries with cheese on top got got cold old fries no cheese hubs burger cold people where nice but were never going back I paid 50 bucks for dog food.I ordered there tonight (11/6/21) & we spent almost $50 for a fatty quesadilla w/hardly anything in it & what is usually my favorite salad which had dry grilled chicken & that wasn't the only dry thing. I offered to pay for extra dressing which the waitress asked if I would pay $4.50 extra for chicken & noodles. This was the worst Salad ever!!No wonder they don't have great ratings.They need to get their act together!.Just meh honestly. I can see why Applebee's is struggling. Any visit here is nothing remarkable and the food is just average at best. They have some great dishes but so many times I leave every location more underwhelmed than when I arrived hungry. I really used to love this chain, now I just love to skip it..Waitress was a doll but not only are sodas $2.99 but no free refillsHey, at least I got two movies tickets are out of dinner, but prob won't be going back..Absolutely delicious salad today and extremely nice, efficient and intelligent waitress!Ashley is an asset to your business!!!.I am here to happily add another well deserved 5 star review for Applebee's Grill + Bar. Very cute spot with great prices and good menu options. Every thing I bought came out in a timely manner. Their employees were all very nice and attentive. You all should check out this beautiful spot..Typical chain Environment . very friendly staff and food was Surprisingly good there also isn't a long wait which was also a plus .better then other Applebee's in the area"
"The food is the best food on City Island hands down! The staff is friendly but unfortunately they only take cash. It's seldom that I carry cash with me and definitely didn't expect that at a above average priced restaurant. But if that's not an issue for you, then I promise you won't be disappointed in anything about this beautiful place..On a sunny Saturday afternoon, the buzz on the street was that we were eating at the best restaurant in town. We waited for the restaurant to open. We were seated promptly.Very cute decor. We received complimentary bread (so it was so good). We ordered oysters, crab cake and apple fritter dessert. It was quite the multi course meal. Oysters were fresh and clean. Crab cake had some nice chunk of crab and it was flavorful. No dry crab cake here. The dessert was a huge portion. You can easily split the dessert with another person. Highly recommended it..I'm reviewing this after my husband and I had dinner here last night. I was surprised to see 3.5 stars but after reading the reviews it's clear that one rogue bad experience ruined it. This place is great! We ordered the strawberry kale salad, the burger, and lobster crab ravioli. The ravioli was so good, I dipped my fries in the sauce! Service was great, everyone was super polite and helpful. We loved dining in the backyard. The decor is super eclectic but still stylish. Just to add too, this is our very first time dining out since the pandemic began and it did NOT disappoint. We are anxious to dine here again. It totally makes the city island traffic worth it!.Just moved to the area. Absolutely AMAZINGGGGG. 10/10 the food was so fresh and delicious. The specials were incredible. We were referred here by a friend. So glad we tried it, we will definitely be back! Service was great too. They made us feel very safe!.Amazing place! First, I was impressed by the atmosphere. So unique! Second, the food was delicious! We had mussels for appetizer, a burger and cod. Everything was very tasty. The third, the stuff was very friendly and especially our waitress (Irish girl). We came from Brooklyn randomly and didn't expect much but wow!!! Definitely come back in the future!.Reservations at 730 for 6. We weren't seated until after 830. The hostess was not even polite or apologetic. We were patient and politely waited (out side in the cold I should mention) We were made to feel like we were bothering her and couldn't care less whether we stuck around or not. I understand things are difficult for restaurants right now but the way we were treated like we were bothering her was completely ridiculous. I'll say that the food was very good but for me going out is to recieve good service as there is nothing there that we cannot make ourselves at home ( and I do realize this is not the case for everyone, not everyone can cook well or likes to cook ) but the service was awful. I will never go here again..There garden is lovely.  The service was prompt and pleasant. I ordered a seared tuna salad without dressing and it came with dressing and there was no problem sending it back.  The server was apologetic. On the negative side, we had mussels as an appetizer.  The presentation and sauce were gorgeous.  However the mussels themselves tasted like frozen mussels.  The calamari was ok.   They gave a free little appetizer of crostini and salad which was delicious.At the prices they charge at this restaurant, I would expect fresh fish..The atmosphere, wait staff and cocktails are great! However, the most important part, the food, not the best. I am not a picky eater by any means but I was very turned off by the mussels. They use a larger ones, perhaps New Zealand, which I've had before and loved, but here they were very chewy and hard to swallow. I usually don't get turned off by texture either but visually and texturally, it was very difficult to get past. My fiancé's penne vodka was also not the greatest, sauce was broken and tasted tart? I wish we liked it but it wasn't for us..TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!  I have never been so disappointed as I was last weekend (Saturday 11/13 at 6:30). First and foremost, you cannot sit diners outside in freezing, cold, windy, rainy weather without HEATERS!!!!! I mean does anyone in the world like to eat dinner at a restaurant shivering and wearing their coat??? Absolutely not!! If you are going to have outdoor dining in winter, since it is now November, then you need to make sure they are going to be warm and comfortable. Secondly, do not sit all the tables outside all at once. I NEVER saw my waitress!!!! She was so inundated with like 5 tables she never came and checked on us. Literally, I was so cold and annoyed that I couldn't wait to leave. It's a shame since I have loved going to the restaurant in the past. Not sure when I will go back!.After having a quick meal on the island earlier in the day, made our way here to try something a little different for an early dinner. Beautiful patio outside to take advantage of the nice weather.Menu is a mish-mash of Italian, Mexican, and American dishes. Was thinking about the crab cakes, asking the waiter if it's locally caught - it was not. Instead, settled on the Chicken Empanadas ($12) and a beer ($6.50). To start you get free bread and olive oil; hard crust on the outside and soft inside makes for a good start. Empanadas came next, three well fried pieces served with sour cream and salsa/baked beans. For some reason the salsa was placed on the black beans, which didn't help either item. Empanadas are filled with diced chicken which tasted from a can. Had to add sour cream and salsa to get some flavor. Also tried the Rigatoni ($17?) - al dente style pasta smothered in a vegetable marsala sauce. Pasta is fine but the sauce is overly sweet, overpowering the accompanying veggies.I actually love the service here as everyone is friendly/helpful; however the food is not up to par."
"If I won the lottery, I think I'd spend half of my money on dinners at Kajitsu. If you have any doubts about whether or not this is worth it, I promise it is. Even if you aren't vegan, the menu has so much flavor and textural complexity that you won't miss the meat. My mind was just blown away one dish after another. My favorite dishes were the seasonal ingredient salad, which was just flavor and texture bombs in every bite, the pistachio fava bean paste plus grilled fennel and homemade seitan, and the jicama bamboo soup, which just reminded me of home. As you can see from the pictures, it's impossible to describe these dishes in words. You just have to experience them yourself. Even if you think you don't like things like asparagus and radish or whatever, I promise this will be the best, tenderest, literally almost creamy asparagus you'll ever have. I dream of sitting at the counter at Kajitsu and being fed until I die of happiness. You can live this dream too. Just make a reservation..The vegan omakase was a very unique experience overall, with several intriguing vegetable/noodle/soup dishes and a few ""just ok"" courses in between. I appreciated the attention to detail, and felt like I left with some new perspectives on how vegetables and tofu can be prepared.Most of the courses are really small, even for a fine dining place. I actually enjoyed not being stuffed afterwards, but it might not be filling enough for some of my male friends. I did find the distribution of serving sizes weird; the first 9 courses were mostly bite-sized (i.e. 25-200 calories each), so I found it shocking when the 10th course was a deep bowl of udon with a rich curry sauce, large enough to be a meal on its own. My favorite:- ""Oshinogi"": a vegetable salad with a diverse assortment of vegetables, leaves, and jelly sauces. I had no idea what I was eating but it was flavorful and each bite was something new.- tempura dish: still warm, loved the crunchy thin layer of batter, paired with a delicious broccoli sauce (reminded me of saag in Indian cuisine)- grilled fennel: the best part was the pistachio sauce, very nutty and aromatic. We licked our plates when no one was looking.- seasonal starter: the softest, best-textured asparagus I've ever had.Good but not mind-blowing:- Udon dish: yeah it's really hearty and savory, but it doesn't taste terribly different from some good street udon.- desserts: the strawberry jelly and mochi were small in size but had a nice kick in flavor.Meh:- Kuchidori: a sticky tofu in between two wafers. The texture of the tofu is quite unusual -- goo-ey, like a thicker version of a marshmallow. But the flavor was really bland and I wish there was some sauce/seasoning. The wafer actually had a slightly revolting scent to me. - Hassun (hirashi sushi + fava beans): really not that interesting, veggies over rice just hits different without meat tbh and there was no soy sauce.- Soup + Rice + Mukōzuke: rice was bland, again the soup is hearty and thicker than normal miso, but nothing extraordinary. The woodear was coated with something that has the texture of the snail mucus in my night skincare routine..Overall, this was more experiential dining than delicious food. I unfortunately can't describe any of the dishes in detail because I truly have no idea what I ate, but vegetable after vegetable. So many vegetables and soups I was a balloon after it, but hungry a couple hours after leaving.There was absolutely zero music and a somewhat cold atmosphere. You felt the need to speak softly and even still could hear everyone else's conversation.The best dishes for me were a salad of sorts and red soup. The worst were a burnt tofu with decorative shell and a curry noodle soup. Nothing blew us away, except a very high bill for mediocre food and poor ambience. Would not recommend unless you are a vegan who wants to cross off all the spots in NYC..This place. The attention to detail was impeccable in the 12-course dinner. From the chef taste-testing the sauces to the aesthetic placement of each leaf in the salad, I could tell the staff were very skilled and knowledgeable in creating and explaining each dish. For the sesame tofu ""sandwich"", the soft tofu was made a particular size and positioned in the middle so that it would become evenly distributed with the crispy shell as it was eaten, creating a perfect balance of textural contrast. Honestly going into the details and thought for each dish would take a million words. You have to experience it for yourself. What's even more impressive is that the courses change monthly. Reservations need to be made at least 1-2 weeks in advance, so plan ahead!.Top 10 meals I've ever had. My partner and I dined at Kajitsu for a special occasion and both still drool thinking about the food. It was both beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. Neither of us is vegan, but I'm vegetarian and we both enjoy the creativity and thoughtfulness of fine vegan dining. It's a particularly special treat to be able to enjoy vegan Japanese food, since vegetarian options at most Japanese restaurants (like American or European ones) are an afterthought. The menu here changes monthly and is prix fixe. While pricey, it's worth every single penny -- even for those on budgets. I'd describe each dish, but there were ~12 of them, plus matcha, and each was excellent. The meal overall felt well balanced, exciting, adventurous, and delightful. The service was courteous and kind. If you're celebrating an occasion, you'll be served an extra little dessert with a somebubbly for a toast. 10/10, would recommend, already planning to make Kajitsu an annual pilgrimage..I did not expect this.I'm as omnivore as you can get, and I would love to come back and try their next menus. Don't skip this place because it has ""vegan"" in its description, it is good, quality, traditional, not processed, Japanese cuisine, with rich flavors, combination of textures, and those unicorn dishes - where every different bite is unlike the other.The ""omakase"" tasting menu is $120 + tax & tip. It starts with delicate dishes, and slowly becomes richer, more complex, and aggressive - in a good way.You won't go hungry, this is a lot of food.Now I need for some out-of-town vegans friends to visit, just so I'll have an excuse to come back here..Fabulous meal-- not just fabulous vegan meal. This review is for the price fixed dinner. For lunch/snack/tea advice, see my tip We have eaten at many price fixed restaurants around the world, many of them  Japanese. We've eaten shojin ryori ( temple food) in temples of Japan. My husband has a sake sommelier certification  It is hard to surprise us when it comes to Japanese food. Kajitsu was not merely excellent food, it also surprised us with some flavor combinations we had not had before. Every course was delicious  with very well balanced flavors and textures. The soup course was so good I asked how the chef made it. The chef came out to describe the process, and specific vegetables-- it was a white miso and sake lee broth.  I've had plenty of great Japanese soups but never with sake lees, which is a flavor I love. Another standout dish had yuzu and white miso on cauliflower.  The mochi dessert was one of the best we've ever had.  The sake pairing was also good and a surprise. There were several my husband had not had before and the variety of locations/ origins as well as sake types were varied and well paired with the food. All were served in beautiful glasses. We were celebrating a special occasion and they brought us 2 complimentary glasses of champagne This is a must do restaurant. If you are vegan or vegetarian, why have you not been here?  If you are not vegetarian, you won't notice the lack of meat. Everything is tasty and beautiful. Bathroom grade: B+ ( and easily fixable). The lock on the door was broken -- swinging on one screw so it worked but needed a repair person. The door itself was also heavy to open.  The room is otherwise clean and pleasant. Just expect a bit more precision and loveliness to match the rest of the establishment's mood. It's small ( not ADA accessible, but the restaurant itself has stairs at entry and more to go up to the main dining room ).Best dining experience I'v had probably ever! From the service to the friendly staff to the amazing presentation and overall experience, everything was beyond incredible.  12 courses plus matcha and their menu changes based on the season. I enjoyed the apple dessert and fried shiitake mushrooms the most!I loved how this was a vegan restaurant so the tasting menu was something I could actually enjoy without having to worry about substitutions for meat. The staff was aware that we were celebrating my husband's birthday so they brought out champagne and caramel dessert, which was nice..That was one of the best meals I've ever had, not even taking into account it was vegan. 13 courses of some of the most interesting and delicious dishes you can ask for.The location is unassuming and feels like you are eating in someone's living room for a nice charming home cooked meal feeling. They start the meal by giving you a hot towel to wash your hands, which was a nice touch.Honestly I can't remember all the courses but some of my favorite were the fried Japanese chestnuts, the soup and rice course with the sweet potato, the miso soup, the grilled mushroom with walnut paste and the fried truffle.They really earned that Michelin star. 10 out of 5 would recommend to a friend.Kajitsu checks all the boxes with great quality food, amazing presentation, and attentive staff! The menu is fully vegan and rotates every month, so dishes include ingredients that are in-season at the time. During dinner, the restaurant serves their take on omakase. The staff shows you a basket full of the fresh items for your meal, then each course is served one at a time. They also provide a brief description when each course is brought out.I went with my party in September so there were plenty of mushrooms served throughout the evening. My personal favorite course was the grilled wild maitake with pine nuts and nama-fu, which was absolutely delicious (even to those in my party who are not normally fans of mushrooms!). I was also super impressed with the sesame tofu monaka and have not really tasted anything quite like this before. The sesame tofu filling was savory, with a small kick of wasabi, and sandwiched between light and crispy wafers. We ended our meal with two small desserts: grape jelly and the seasonal wagashi and matcha from Ippodo (which is also located downstairs and open during the day).Our group had a great time here. Make sure to savor each course and enjoy the overall experience!"

The sesame tofu filling was savory, with a small kick of wasabi, and sandwiched between light and crispy wafers. We ended our meal with two small desserts: grape jelly and the seasonal wagashi and matcha from Ippodo (which is also located downstairs and open during the day).Our group had a great time here. Make sure to savor each course and enjoy the overall experience!"
"What is the point of eating? Is it just for sustenance? For a temporary tickling of the tastebuds? Eating at Kokage, I think, opens a space for a different type of answer: to cultivate the qualities of patience, gratitude, attention. In short, a rare experience of dining that is, in my mind, quite Japanese. Kokage is the less expensive and overwhelming version of Kajitsu, the vegetarian kaiseki tour-de-force that is unmissable but also somewhat unapproachable, especially for the wallet. Kokage's food delivers all of the virtues of its more mature sister. Subtle, refined flavors. Seasonal ingredients and recipes. Understated elegance and attention to detail. Large colorful sushi rolls this is not - even good Japanese restaurants in NYC don't always exemplify these virtues, all of which are de rigueur for eating in Japan.I had the Shojin bento (but there's plenty of meat on the menu for you carnivores). The meal is named after shōjin ryōri, the vegetarian temple cuisine whose preparation and consumption are in themselves meditation. The bento is not a huge amount of food, but every portion hides depth. Eat slowly and you'll notice the nutty undertones in the rice, how every piece of a small collection of simmered items has a different color, flavor, and texture. How the different tastes of each small course build up to the soba course, whose broth is more robust to match the chewy earthiness of the noodles. If you are paying attention, their ever-so-slightly uneven thicknesses show a handmade touch.Don't miss their teas, frothy traditional matcha, or the handmade sweets customized to the season. Kokage offers all these things off their lunch menu, or all afternoon in the cafe downstairs. So if you're not in a rush (and you shouldn't be if this food has done its job), stroll downstairs once you're finished and enjoy a digestif.In some Zen monasteries, a prayer before each meal reminds that food is nourishment for the body so that we can walk along the Path. What path? The way of life that is thoughtful, unhurried, gracious, and content. These are the tastes that Kokage offers..The food quality, is 5 stars, *Maybe little too much rice in wagyu beef Donburi However, the servers were not professional at all (they are nice though) and super slow. Took more than 30 minutes for ready made ( I think) dessert and tea without any follow ups until we asked. Unfortunately Not going back again.....Kajitsu by night, Kokage by day! Came back here for a quick lunch before proceeding with Xmas shopping in the area.I was promptly seated and brought some fresh water. I ordered the kinoko soba set with sushi for $22. Finished off the meal with their December mochi & matcha set for $15. Nothing much to complain about besides me being a cheap skate and docking a star for price  Mochi is to die for! Freshly made  with the perfect yuzu flavor this month. A great place for zen and treat yourself clean meal..Came with three others and it was confusing to get here. There are basically three restaurants/shops in one. You just head downstairs to enter and a host will greet you. The waiter served us hand towels immediately but took awhile for him to take our order. Immediately noticed that it was a super quiet and delicate place - was so quiet that it was uncomfortable. With three others, it was difficult to control our octave. A few times where we laughed a little too loud, people stared or maybe even grilled us. Onto the food - I'm typically not a fan of soba because it's sort of bland and plain, but I ordered the mushroom seasonal soba since it seemed to be recommended. It wasn't memorable. We also shared the karage and that was nicely seasoned. Overall, a bit pretentious and food was alright so the rate rating is more of a 3.5, but Yelp only allows a 3 or 4..Fancy tea house serves some quality Japanese fare and the most traditional sense.  Tuna donburi was served in a small bowl with perfectly cooked rice and topped with shaved scallions.  The miso soup tasted so concentrated I wasn't able to finish it.  Good service and elegant decor..Ambiance and aesthetics: 4/5Food: 3/5Weighted average of 3 since I put a lot more weight on the food itself.Was looking for a place for some cold soba for Saturday dinner and stumbled upon this cute place. The entrance is a bit easy to miss if you walk super fast like I do - especially since they don't have obvious signage. I actually walked by it thinking its a tea shop - It's actually both! The tea shop in the front offers various tea options and it's interesting to see the tea making process.First of all, I do love the ambiance and the overall aesthetics this place has - from the decor to the table setup and all the tableware and dinnerware - the plates, bowls and cups were so pretty and elegant that I wanna buy all of them!The food unfortunately is where this place fell short - I expected a lot more especially given the price. Overall good presentation, but flavor is a bit lacking albeit being a little overly salty for my liking.Amazing vibe for date / having conversation since it's just so very quiet - you may actually have to whisper if you don't want everybody else dining there hear your conversation..I came here for dinner on a Tuesday night. I made a reservation on Opentable because they're not taking walk-ins during COVID-19 times. It was a bit confusing since there's 3 restaurants in one place (Ippudo Tea, Kokage, Kajitsu). Kajitsu is upstairs and Kokage is in the back on the first floor. The place was practically empty when we arrived. The restaurant served very traditional Japanese food. You are given a hot towel upon arrival. I ordered the tempura soba and my companion ordered the tuna donburi. Both dishes were excellent and delicious. The tempura was perfectly fried and light. The shrimp tempura was quite large. The soba was cooked well and the soba sauce was flavorful. The tuna donburi was fresh and the rice was well seasoned. Why only 4 stars? The service was a bit strange since the hostess was the server as well. I know there's only two tables but am I wrong to want an actual server? I would still come back to try other dishes..Quality and services are great but not too impressive.We tried the fish cake, Mochi, Duck soba and tuna donburi. Everything tasted good and the service was on par. It was a good dinner but not impressive enough to have me come back, especially for the price. I think I expected just a little more for this price in terms of food creativity and service. Some interaction with the chef and more seasonal flavors would be good....Too salty; slow service. The item I had really wanted, per the online menu I checked just before going, was no longer being served. Not a great atmosphere. Maybe the upstairs omakase offerings is better but the Soba-ya downstairs is a total miss. It felt like a makeshift school dining area, and not in a charming way..Authentic Japanese!  Cozy seating on the second floor (the first floor is a cafe).  Nice service, tasty Japanese lunch sets.  Clean, quiet, and has a nice view near the window."
